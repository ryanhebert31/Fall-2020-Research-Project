"US weapons won't fill military gap between Taiwan and mainlandnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT The White House is moving forward with three sales of advanced weaponry to the island of Taiwan, sending in recent days a notification of the deals to Congress for approval, Reuters reported on Tuesday.This bill is much likely to be approved. Now that the White House has submitted it to Congress, there must have been the necessary back-channels of communication within the Washington's inner circles.Although the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979 states that the US can sell only defensive weapons to the island of Taiwan, the US has been helping develop the offensive capability of the military on the island of Taiwan under the guise of self-defense.For example, a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) proposed to Congress, which can launch rockets for precise strikes against landing forces or naval vessels, can also launch tactical ballistic missiles for attacks against distant targets — with definite offensive attributes.Among these weapons and equipment, HIMARS is of great concern because its lethality is very strong. In the future, the US may sell long-range precision-guided munitions to Taiwan. The degree to which US arms sale will improve the military on the island depends on what equipment is sold, ammunition and also upgrade capabilities — especially if the US readily upgrade those weapons to give them greater precision firepower at longer distances.But overall, whatever the US sells to Taiwan, the balance of military strength between the island's military and the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) will not change — Chinese mainland will always retain the upper hand.This is because the PLA has a firm control of air and sea. The Chinese mainland has an absolute dominance with long-range precision striking capabilities too. Washington hopes to encourage separatist forces through the sale of select weapons and equipment. However, the strength of the military on the island remains the same. When the US sells weapons and equipment, its first purpose is to make money. Its second purpose is to cause conflicts in cross-Straits relations and counterbalance the development of the Chinese mainland. It is not sincere to help the military on the island improve its overall combat capability.However, the authorities of Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen do not seem to have a clear awareness of the aim of US arms sales. Since Tsai took office in 2016, Taiwan authorities have heavily invested in weaponry made by the US. Their dependence on support from the US to resist the Chinese mainland's pursuit of reunification is destined to be a dead end. Only by abiding by the 1992 Consensus can the island create a secure situation, and gain more opportunities to advance its development.Washington's arms sales to Taiwan have been significantly influenced by its weapon manufacturers, who have close ties with political elites at the White House. In an attempt to get more orders or make more profits for these arms dealers, some US politicians will not hesitate to sabotage China-US relations — or trigger more conflicts across the Straits.In July, China announced to sanction US company Lockheed Martin, the main contractor involved in the latest arms package to Taiwan. This was a necessary move to safeguard national interests. This can work as a kind of countermeasure and warning against US weaponry contractors selling arms which undermines the peace across the Straits. The possibility that China will increase sanctions on these dealers cannot be ruled out. They must pay the price.Additionally, the Chinese mainland should boost its military capability to safeguard peace and stability of the Straits, keeping its absolute advantage over Taiwan. In this scenario, no matter what kind of US weaponry Taiwan purchases, it will be in vain.The author is a Beijing-based military analyst. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	10/13/20	0	0	0.976	1
"Exposing Taiwan spying a warning, not a prelude to war: observersnPhoto: State security agency Three consecutive days of media exposure of hundreds of espionage cases involving spies from the island of Taiwan serves to warn Taiwan separatist forces, rather than a prelude to the use of force in efforts to reunify Taiwan with the mainland, observers said on Tuesday.In a special operation dubbed Thunder-2020 Crackdown, Chinese mainland state security authorities have foiled hundreds of such espionage cases involving Taiwan spies who carried out malicious activities against mainland, attempting to disrupt cross-Straits exchanges and resist the reunification of China.Major cases detailed by state media in the past two days show that the forms of such spy activities range from academic exchanges to business activities.Cheng Yu-chin's case serves as a typical one that collected information under the guise of academic exchanges, while sowing discord between China and other countries. By taking advantage of his post in Europe, Cheng established a think tank in the Czech Republic, underlying his intention to spy on the mainland, and instigate betrayal among mainland personnel to work for them.Another figure arrested in this crackdown, Lee Meng-chu, is an active member of a Taiwan separatist group who concealed his espionage activities by posing as a businessman, and was later arrested for interfering in Hong Kong affairs during the 2019 turmoil.Chinese mainland national security organs have recently launched the Thunder-2020 special operation to crack down on intelligence infiltration and sabotage activities carried out by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its spy agencies against the mainland, said Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson of the Taiwan Affairs Office of State Council, at a routine press conference on Wednesday, commenting on inquiries concerning the timing of the case exposure.In the recent past, the DPP has been stepping up their association with external anti-China forces, and frequently creating incidents and engaging in separatist activities, which severely undermined the stability and peace of the Taiwan Starts situation and harmed Chinese national sovereignty, security and development interests, Zhu said.Zhu urged the relevant parties on the island of Taiwan to follow the major historical trend of national rejuvenation, cross-Straits reunification and growing national strength, and refrain from doing things that will harm the overall interests of the Chinese people.""Spies gather intelligence in the mainland by means of interpersonal contact, taking advantage of the shared language and cultural background,"" Li Wei, a counter-terrorism expert at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday.""It is hard for ordinary people to detect spies during their daily work and lives. They usually conceal their intentions at first, while gradually luring and coercing them with bribes under the guise of academic exchanges or business events,"" Li noted, adding that colleges, research institutes, and non-governmental organizations could become the main targets of espionage.Analysts pointed out that intelligence agency mainly targets three aspects. They appoint spies to poke at the mainland's military strengths and economic interests. There is also a surge in collusion with other separatist forces since the DPP stepped into office.This year's operation has revealed the close ties between secessionist forces in Hong Kong and Taiwan, with spies in Taiwan feeding off and sponsoring Hong Kong activists that caused much chaos, Yang Lixian, a research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center of Cross-Straits Relations, told the Global Times on Tuesday, citing Lee's case, which jeopardized national security in Hong Kong.Some media that answer to the Taiwan separatist green campers had interpreted with fear that such intensive exposure served as a run-up to public opinion before the mainland turns to use force for reunification, media reported.Some even used the term ""double threat"" to refer to the mainland's recent moves, including the crackdown and the amphibious landing drills conducted off the southeastern coast, spreading panic among the local community.However, Li believes that the moves are not a prelude to the use of force, as some media speculated, or an indication of a shutdown of peace and stability across the Straits.The combination moves would send a warning to the DPP while revealing their malicious intentions to seek Taiwan secession. It also serves as a reminder to mainlanders to stay alert to spying activities.National security authorities also carried out Thunderbolt 2018 crackdown two years ago, which has identified more than 100 espionage cases.

"US attack arms sales shows strategic ambiguity on Taiwan fading: expertsnA soldier assigned to a combined arms brigade under the PLA 76th Group Army uses smoke bombs to create a smokescreen for concealment as he engages mock enemy with his rifle during a real-combat drill on September 26, 2020, which aims to beef up soldiers' courage and uprightness in battlefield. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Zhang Yongqiang) The US remains persistent in pushing forward the sales of several types of attack weapons to the island of Taiwan, which experts say shows the US strategic ambiguity on Taiwan is fading, and its policy is gradually leaning toward Taiwan secession.Taiwan authority has played down the US arms deals, calling them media speculation, a move that showed that Taiwan secessionists have been deterred by the recent PLA drills, and reluctant to pay unreasonable, forced protection money to the US in the form of arms sales, Chinese mainland analysts said on Tuesday.The White House has sent a notification for approval to the US Congress over the sales for a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) truck-based rocket launcher, SLAM-ER long-range air-to-ground missiles, and external sensor pods for F-16 jets that allow the real-time transmission of imagery and data from the aircraft to ground stations, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing five sources familiar with the situation.Taiwan authorities said they have not been notified by the US, and cannot confirm the deal, Taipei-based newspaper the Liberty News reported on Tuesday.In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a regular press conference on Tuesday that China resolutely opposes the US plan to sell three types of weapons to the island of Taiwan, and will respond based on the situation.Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the weapons are offensive in nature, and would seriously violate the August 17 Joint Communiqué.This is a provocative move to the current status in the Taiwan Straits, but will not change the power imbalance between the Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan, as the mainland holds absolute superiority, Song said.Prior to the alleged US Congress notification, Reuters reported last month that the US is planning to sell seven major weapons systems to the island. In addition to the three in the recent notification, aerial drones, anti-ship missiles and underwater mines were also included. Reuters reported on Tuesday that they were also expected to reach Congress for approval soon.In response to the Reuters report, Taiwan's defense authority said it was ""merely speculation by local media.""Taiwan authorities did not react to US arms sales like in the past, and this showed that the US is forcing the arms sales to Taiwan, to pay protection money, Chinese mainland observers said.In May, the US approved the sale of 18 MK-48 Mod6 Advanced Technology Heavy Weight Torpedoes and related equipment for an estimated $180 million to the island of Taiwan; in July, the US announced a deal for the recertification of its Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) air defense missiles, at an estimated cost of $620 million. The US also finalized a deal for 66 F-16V fighter jets to Taiwan at $8 billion in August. This means Taiwan has paid $8.8 billion to the US this year.Song said that Taiwan authority is left with no choice but to pay protection money to the US, and as the PLA is demonstrating its vast military capabilities with recent military exercises, Taiwan secessionists are acknowledging that no matter what kind of weapons they buy from the US, they cannot face up to the PLA.The PLA has been conducting aerial and naval exercises and patrols in the Taiwan Straits since mid-September, and recently conducted a large-scale amphibious landing exercise off the mainland's southeastern coast near Taiwan. Starting Tuesday, it is also holding live-fire maritime drills off the coast of Zhangzhou, East China's Fujian Province, which Taiwan media said is less than 100 kilometers from Kinmen.Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the arms sales indicate the US is making its one-China policy more clear, and leaning toward supporting Taiwan secession, which is very dangerous.The US used to applied ambiguity to its one-China policy, Li said.To counter the US provocation, the PLA should continue to boost its power, maintain powerful deterrence on the Taiwan question, and strike resolutely and fast when the US or the Taiwan authority does something to harm China's sovereignty, Li said.Song said that the arms sales are also likely part of US President Donald Trump's re-election campaign to win support from US arms dealers and more votes.Beijing-based military expert Li Jie said that the US will not sacrifice its interests in a direct clash with the PLA, as it only wants to sell outdated weapons to Taiwan at a high price.

"Taiwan spies use cross-Straits exchanges, mainland think tank meetings to gather intelligence: sourcesnIn 2013, Kuo Jia-ying (transliteration), a female employee of Fu Hsing Broadcasting Station (FHBS) of Taiwan, started to get in touch with Tsai, and claimed that she was Tsai’s schoolmate. FHBS is a subsidiary of a Taiwan “military intelligence agency.” According to Tsai’s confession, Kuo invited him for coffee from time to time and brought him some gifts, like healthcare products, and whenever she knew that he had visited the mainland for a conference, she would call him and ask who he met, and what information he got about the mainland’s policy toward Taiwan. According to sources with the mainland’s state security agency, Kuo is a spy serving in Taiwan “military intelligence agency.” She funded Tsai’s organization, including paying rent totaling TW$360,000 ($12,600) when it encountered a funding shortage, and provided suggestions to Tsai on how to make exchanges with the mainland guests. After the separatist DPP took power in the island in 2016, cross-Straits exchanges significantly decreased. Kuo suggested Tsai establish a “pro-mainland” online media and invite mainland scholars and journalists to contribute their articles, so that they could collect intelligence. Kuo gradually seized control over the media. An anonymous officer of the state security bureau of Xiamen, Fujian Province told the Global Times that Kuo always tried to convince Tsai that everything she wanted from the mainland scholars and journalists was public information rather than classified intelligence, so it won’t cause trouble for Tsai. In the past few years, Tsai has submitted intelligence on more than 50 mainland officials, scholars and journalists to Taiwan intelligence agencies, and got paid about TW$5 million ($174,428). Kuo has always requested Tsai to collect internal information from the mainland, and also wanted him to build connections with mainland policymakers on Taiwan affairs. When Tsai got in touch with people in the mainland, he always claimed that he “supports reunification” to reduce suspicion, according to Tsai’s confession. After Tsai was convicted in July, he expressed remorse. “I have conducted cross-Straits exchanges for more than 20 years, but I didn’t expect that I would be used by the Taiwan ‘military intelligence agency’ to damage national security.” "	10/13/20	0	0	0.8225	1
"Will the US abandon strategic ambiguity over Taiwan?nVessels in the Taiwan Straits, July 20, 2017. /CGTN Photo Richard Hass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, and David Sacks, a fellow of the council, published an article in the September issue of Foreign Affairs journal, claiming that the policy of strategic ambiguity toward the island of Taiwan needs to be replaced by a policy of strategic clarity.Joseph Bosco, the former China director for the secretary of defense, also advocated in September for the US to adopt a strategic clarity policy that he thinks is absolutely necessary.It is not surprising that some US officials and scholars have recently raised the question of strategic ambiguity again. To further strengthen the containment and suppression of China, playing the Taiwan card is the highest cost-effective. The US hopes to threaten the Chinese mainland by improving its relations with the island of Taiwan and selling arms to the island. But the comprehensive national strength and military advantages of the Chinese mainland are becoming more and more obvious, and the military capabilities on the two sides of the straits are irreversibly unbalanced. As a result, voices have arisen that the US should draw a ""red line"" to restrain the Chinese mainland.The sense of urgency among US hawks over the Chinese mainland has been heightened after Chinese military aircraft flied around the Taiwan island and officially denied the existence of the so-called median line. However, different voices regarding policy toward Taiwan are not rare. There was previously talk of abandoning Taiwan, calling on the US to rethink the strategic significance of the island during the administration of former president Barack Obama, but it never came to a real deal.The strategic ambiguity policy has been the basis of US policy toward cross-Straits relations for decades. It is also in the best interests of the US to maintain its initiative in the Taiwan Straits. From Washington's perspective, it can deter the Chinese mainland from attacking the island, while restraining Taiwan from acting recklessly in the region.The US would put itself in an awkward position if it clarifies the policy. If the US commits to helping to defend the island, the authorities in Taiwan may well believe that they have ""backers"" and may further promote ""Taiwan independence,"" which would only deepen the concerns of the Chinese mainland. This could lead to preparations for a military struggle and could even prompt the Chinese PLA to launch a pre-emptive strike on the island of Taiwan.In such a scenario, the US might choose to honor its commitment to defend the island of Taiwan and engage in direct armed conflict with the Chinese mainland. But an armed conflict between the two nuclear powers is unacceptable and would be devastating to the US. Or it could make verbal statements after Chinese mainland launches military strike on the island of Taiwan. Unfortunately, it would be a major blow to the US' international credibility and the credibility of its commitments. Thus, either option would go contrary to US interests.If strategic ambiguity shifts to strategic clarity, the situation would be similar to the restoration of the US-Taiwan military alliance, a direct assault on the one-China principle and the three communiqués between China and the US. Another choice for the US would be a more subtle expression, which states only that certain actions will be taken, but does not further elaborate what the specific actions are. However, whether and how to fulfill the commitment would greatly restrict the US.If the strategic ambiguity policy is clarified at an extreme level, China-US relations would be severely damaged, or even severed, and peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits would cease to exist.As former US national security advisor John Bolton notes in his book, President Donald Trump doesn't really care about the Taiwan question. Trump suggested that Taiwan is only the size of a pen in comparison to the Resolute desk in the Oval Office. Even if Trump is re-elected, there is little prospect of a shift to strategic clarity. If Joe Biden wins, tensions over the Taiwan Straits are something Biden's team needs to address; there may be less attention paid to the Taiwan question.One of the reasons for the US to insist on strategic ambiguity is that it does not want the Chinese mainland to reunify the island of Taiwan by force, while it fears that the island of Taiwan could deliberately make provocations thus dragging the US into a war. Also defined as the effect of ""dual deterrence,"" this factor is becoming even more important. It is not only because the danger of ""Taiwan Independence"" is growing, but also because the Chinese mainland's strength advantage over Taiwan is too obvious. Therefore, it is more necessary for the US to continue to play the role of ""dual deterrent,"" instead of rushing into danger.The author is deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	10/13/20	1	1	0.9267	1
"Espionage betrays Tsai’s rhetoric of peacenPhoto: State security agency In a special operation dubbed Thunder-2020 Crackdown, Chinese mainland security authorities have foiled hundreds of espionage cases involving spies from the island of Taiwan and arrested a number of Taiwan spies. This is not an isolated operation, as the mainland carries out similar actions every year, given that the rising number of spying operations by Taiwan authorities in the Chinese mainland over the years.Taiwan's espionage activities against the Chinese mainland are mostly carried out in two ways - through organized intelligence espionage network systems or through social groups and individuals misrepresenting themselves who have integrated into all walks of lives in the mainland. Considering the growing number of the uncovered cases, it can be argued that Taiwan's subterfuge is increasing.Given the current complex international situation and overheated tensions between Beijing and Washington, it's very likely espionage orchestrated by Taiwan will escalate.The US will also make full use of the Taiwan card. It has boosted cooperation with relevant Taiwan authorities in intelligence work. For instance, the US has supported the island of Taiwan with satellite technologies. Related moves are aimed at turning the island into a hub for detecting and collecting intelligence on the Chinese mainland. It is reported that below the new compound of the American Institute in Taiwan, the Asia-Pacific's most powerful intelligence facility was installed. This of course is designed to spy on the Chinese mainland to satisfy the needs of the US in its confrontation with China.Taiwan is willing to be the US' pawn and coordinate with the US. Taiwan authorities under leader Tsai Ing-wen also have a need to gather more intelligence on military security, especially considering the Chinese mainland's determination to clamp down on Taiwan secessionist forces.Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities in the island will pour more taxpayers money into spying technologies and spies. They will hardly scale down relevant actions because of intensifying countermoves from the Chinese mainland. The struggle for intelligence across the Straits will become fiercer and we must strengthen our national awareness over the issue, raising our vigilance against spies.During her ""Double Ten"" (October 10) address on Saturday, Tsai hypocritically said ""we will not act rashly"" and ""we are committed to upholding cross-Straits stability,"" pretending to be low-profile and peace-loving, hinting if conflicts happen, it is not her authorities' responsibility. By uncovering rampant espionage cases we have proved that she is saying one thing but doing quite another. The truth is, DPP authorities are accelerating confrontation and jeopardizing peace. The mainland unveiled the Thunder-2020 Crackdown as a warning.It can be predicted that Tsai will keep pretending to seek peace and stability in her rhetoric. But her Saturday speech shows she will accelerate the island's pace of military integration with the US, reshaping global supply chains with the West and away from China, and root out anti-secessionist forces on the island. Taiwan cannot participate in international organizations and relevant activities, but it will organize its own activities on the island, promoting the so-called alliance of the willing, as an attempt to win sympathy and support from the international community.When former Taiwan regional leader Ma Ying-jeou promoted ties with the Chinese mainland, the US and Japan at the same time, Taiwan had to some extent policy independence. But thanks to DPP authorities, the island's flexibility has vanished. Taiwan has no say in cross-Straits ties, which have totally become a subsidiary of China-US relations. The developing situation across the Straits simply matches developments in Beijing-Washington ties.How much international support will Taiwan be able to gather? Assume the island invites disaster by declaring independence, surely its leaders knows that no country will send troops to defend the island. Taiwan should be well aware of this.The author is a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	10/13/20	0	0	0.9946	1

"Taiwan spy used Europe academic post to infiltrate mainland, harm China-Europe ties: sourcesnLü later introduced another Taiwan spy, Vicky Tao, to Cheng, but Tao wanted Cheng to change the previous measures for intelligence gathering – suggesting Cheng collect intelligence on the mainland through his connections in Europe and the US. Cheng said he could establish an institute in the Czech Republic, which would give him opportunities to attend conferences organized by the EU. Tao agreed, and when Cheng returned to Prague, he established the “Institute of China-Europe Political and Economic Studies” under the Charles University in Prague. “By using the title of director of the institute, I can attend more international conferences, so that I can collect more intelligence,” Cheng said in his confession. In 2017, Cheng received an invitation from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to a major academic conference in Vienna. After he reported the issue to Tao, Tao was extremely excited and flew to Vienna the next day with her superior to meet Cheng, and awarded him $10,000 in cash. Cheng said in his confession that “after 1971, Taiwan representatives were not allowed to attend many international conferences, and Taiwan’s overseas personnel or ‘diplomats’ used content from local newspapers to fill their intelligence reports, which was an open secret.” “But this time, Taiwan intelligence agencies saw new hope as I could bring them firsthand intelligence from major international conferences,” Cheng noted in his confession. Tao asked Cheng to attend more major EU or NATO conferences to further learn about the views of European countries and the US on the mainland, in areas including national defense, politics, science and technology, and urged Cheng to broaden his connections, according to the officer of the state security bureau in Zhangzhou. Cheng understood how dangerous it was to serve the Taiwan intelligence agency, so he asked for a “burn after reading” software before sending his intelligence reports to Taiwan, to leave no trace. Every time Cheng traveled to the mainland, he uninstalled the software, and reinstalled it after he left the mainland, according to his confession. "	10/12/20	1	0	0.9952	1
"Washington unlikely to change Taiwan ‘strategic ambiguity’ to enrage BeijingnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT US national security adviser Robert O'Brien on Wednesday said that ""there's also a lot of ambiguity about what the US would do in response to an attack by China on Taiwan,"" according to Reuters. O'Brien was responding to a question about what options the US would have if the Chinese mainland resorts to force to reunite the island of TaiwanWhat O'Brien referred to is a long-standing US policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" regarding the US military's support for the island.Some media outlets and US political elite have recently hyped up the idea that Washington should shift away from being ambiguous to being clear and open about Taiwan.As a matter of fact, it will be difficult for Washington to achieve this sort of shift. Since the 1996 Taiwan Straits crisis, many US political elites have discussed the subject. Some of them argue that the US needs to clarify its policy on the island of Taiwan. But no consensus has yet been reached on this matter of clarity in the US.The US has been playing the island as a card as a tactic to deal with the Chinese mainland. If the US clearly states how to defend the island of Taiwan in case of an attack, it will restrain Washington's flexibility to cope with the Taiwan question. If the commitments are far from being ""sufficient,"" both the island and some of US' allies will be disappointed. Washington will be labeled as being soft on China. Furthermore, if the US makes detailed and definite commitments, it will directly challenge its one-China principle. This will jeopardize China-US relations. The Chinese mainland will firmly protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity no matter what the costs.The separatist forces in Taiwan are becoming increasingly rampant. The authorities of Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen have spared no effort to show its stance of anti-Chinese mainland sentiments. They applaud pro-US positions, hoping Washington will lend it a hand to finally achieve full secession. If the US clarifies its strategy, and makes dedicated commitments to defend the island, Taiwan separatists will be emboldened to officially pursue secession. This will put the US into an unfavorable condition, which the US is reluctant to see.In terms of the Chinese mainland, the Taiwan question concerns its core national interests. If the US crosses China's red-line over this question, Beijing would sever its diplomatic ties with the Washington. There is no doubt that Washington is clearly aware of the importance of the Chinese mainland. It will not take risks to break its ties with the Chinese mainland due to Taiwan, because the price is too high.Therefore, shifting to ""strategic clarity"" will be disadvantageous to the US. Hence, it will be hard to achieve. In fact, Washington intends to maintain the status quo, and keeps playing the trick. This seems to be the most favorable US position.As the Chinese mainland's comprehensive national strength continues to rise, the US labels China as its top rival. This makes the island of Taiwan a decent card for the US to play in order to contain the Chinese mainland's development. Therefore, Washington will no doubt continue to manipulate the Taiwan question.Recently, the Taiwan card has been played with increasing ferocity. US secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary and undersecretary of State visited the island successively. The US has reinforced its military cooperation and increased arms sales to the island too. The US seems to be attempting to make its relations with Taiwan more ""official."" However, in order to avoid provoking the Chinese mainland and for its own interests, it does not seek to officially establish diplomatic relations with Taiwan.The US general election is approaching. No matter who will win the coming presidential election, the US' Taiwan policy will maintain consistent There will be no essential difference. Yet Republicans and Democrats have different focuses. The Democratic Party will be more cautious. It emphasizes the role of Taiwan as a ""democracy paradigm"" in ""guiding"" the development of Chinese mainland. Therefore, the Democratic Party may consider not to overly complicating the Taiwan Straits situation.On the other hand, the Republican Party underlines practical interests, geopolitics, and containing the development of the Chinese mainland. There are some pro-Taiwan forces in Republican Party.

Furthermore, if the US makes detailed and definite commitments, it will directly challenge its one-China principle. This will jeopardize China-US relations. The Chinese mainland will firmly protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity no matter what the costs.The separatist forces in Taiwan are becoming increasingly rampant. The authorities of Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen have spared no effort to show its stance of anti-Chinese mainland sentiments. They applaud pro-US positions, hoping Washington will lend it a hand to finally achieve full secession. If the US clarifies its strategy, and makes dedicated commitments to defend the island, Taiwan separatists will be emboldened to officially pursue secession. This will put the US into an unfavorable condition, which the US is reluctant to see.In terms of the Chinese mainland, the Taiwan question concerns its core national interests. If the US crosses China's red-line over this question, Beijing would sever its diplomatic ties with the Washington. There is no doubt that Washington is clearly aware of the importance of the Chinese mainland. It will not take risks to break its ties with the Chinese mainland due to Taiwan, because the price is too high.Therefore, shifting to ""strategic clarity"" will be disadvantageous to the US. Hence, it will be hard to achieve. In fact, Washington intends to maintain the status quo, and keeps playing the trick. This seems to be the most favorable US position.As the Chinese mainland's comprehensive national strength continues to rise, the US labels China as its top rival. This makes the island of Taiwan a decent card for the US to play in order to contain the Chinese mainland's development. Therefore, Washington will no doubt continue to manipulate the Taiwan question.Recently, the Taiwan card has been played with increasing ferocity. US secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary and undersecretary of State visited the island successively. The US has reinforced its military cooperation and increased arms sales to the island too. The US seems to be attempting to make its relations with Taiwan more ""official."" However, in order to avoid provoking the Chinese mainland and for its own interests, it does not seek to officially establish diplomatic relations with Taiwan.The US general election is approaching. No matter who will win the coming presidential election, the US' Taiwan policy will maintain consistent There will be no essential difference. Yet Republicans and Democrats have different focuses. The Democratic Party will be more cautious. It emphasizes the role of Taiwan as a ""democracy paradigm"" in ""guiding"" the development of Chinese mainland. Therefore, the Democratic Party may consider not to overly complicating the Taiwan Straits situation.On the other hand, the Republican Party underlines practical interests, geopolitics, and containing the development of the Chinese mainland. There are some pro-Taiwan forces in Republican Party. Therefore, The Republican's practice seems to be more radical.The author is Deputy Director and senior fellow of the Institute of American Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	10/12/20	0	1	0.9962	1
"Taiwan spy used Europe academic post to infiltrate mainland, harm China-Europe ties: sourcesnLü later introduced another Taiwan spy, Vicky Tao, to Cheng, but Tao wanted Cheng to change the previous measures for intelligence gathering – suggesting Cheng collect intelligence on the mainland through his connections in Europe and the US.

Tao agreed, and when Cheng returned to Prague, he established the “Institute of China-Europe Political and Economic Studies” under the Charles University in Prague. “By using the title of director of the institute, I can attend more international conferences, so that I can collect more intelligence,” Cheng said in his confession.

"PLA holds amphibious landing drills to ‘show firm will against Taiwan secessionists’n An attack helicopter attached to an army aviation brigade under the PLA 72nd Group Army fires rocket at a simulated target on the island during a fire strike training exercise in late September, 2020. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Zhang Huanpeng) The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) recently conducted large-scale joint amphibious landing drills off the Chinese mainland's southeastern coast amid increasingly rampant Taiwan secessionist moves, including hundreds of espionage attempts on the Chinese mainland and collusion with the US. Chinese mainland analysts said on Sunday that the PLA drills again demonstrate the mainland's strong capability and firm will against Taiwan secessionists and push for reunification, following PLA aerial and naval exercises and patrols in the Taiwan Straits that have continued for nearly a month.The exercises featured concentrated deployments of unmanned aerial, surface and ground vehicles, which will significantly boost the PLA's efficiency in seizing the control of an island, experts said.Cross-service multidimensional joint amphibious landing exercises recently started in waters off the coast of East China's Fujian and South China's Guangdong provinces, in which the combined amphibious forces affiliated with the PLA 73rd Group Army integrated with newly established forces including army aviation, special operation and electronic countermeasures units and comprehensively tested their combat capabilities in realistic war scenarios, China Central Television (CCTV), the state broadcaster, reported on Sunday.A large number of amphibious landing ships are seen in the report footage transporting amphibious armored vehicles, tanks, artillery and troops to the target island.Before the assault, scout units first conducted reconnaissance on the enemy using aerial drones, guiding strikes on hostile artillery and missile positions. Unmanned ships deployed forward to destroy sea mines and obstacles, opening a safe sea lane, with multiple waves of attack helicopters launching low-altitude aerial assaults in formation on remaining hostile positions, providing cover for the landing forces.After that, amphibious armored assault groups soon made it to dry land, and tanks and infantry fighting vehicles wiped out remaining hostile targets and captured their positions. Multiple types of unmanned ground vehicles were seen in the CCTV report footage, including some equipped with guns and some carrying ammunition for foot soldiers.Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday that the cross-sea amphibious landing is the most important strategy to prepare for a military conflict against Taiwan, which may be the only way to resolve the Taiwan question if it comes to that point.As amphibious landing is an extremely challenging operation to militaries all over the world, the PLA must enhance related capabilities so it will become capable of taking over the island of Taiwan with the fastest speed, Song said.The PLA's amphibious landing exercises come at a time when Taiwan secessionists have been increasingly frequently making statements and moves to try to separate Taiwan from China, and the exercises showed the Chinese mainland's strong capability and firm will against Taiwan secessionists and push for reunification.Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen, in an address on Saturday, continued the confrontational mindset and hostile mentality, boasted rhetoric about seeking ""independence,"" advocated collusion with foreign forces and confused the minds of people in the island, Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council, said on Saturday.Taiwan secessionist forces have made more and more attempts to conduct espionage on the Chinese mainland in recent years in order to disrupt cross-Straits exchanges and resist the reunification of China, and recently, hundreds of Taiwan espionage cases have been cracked down by the mainland's state security agency in an operation codenamed ""Thunder-2020.""The US is also playing the Taiwan card, as it sent a warship to the waters off China's Xisha Islands in the South China Sea on Friday without China's approval, a move Taiwan media interpreted as pressuring the PLA over its drills in the Taiwan Straits. The US is also increasingly selling weapons and sending senior officials to the island.The Chinese Defense Ministry and the PLA Eastern Theater Command announced in mid-September that the PLA was holding joint maritime and aerial exercises and combat-readiness patrols in the Taiwan Straits. No amphibious landing exercises featuring ground forces were announced at that time.Xu Guangyu, a senior adviser to the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told the Global Times on Sunday that while the latest amphibious landing drills are tactical exercises, they serve as a concrete move of strategic deterrence.Many Taiwan secessionists do not understand the true capability of the PLA in terms of cross-sea combat, and they think the mainland's reunification-by-force is only a verbal threat, Xu said.The drills are of significant meaning in telling Taiwan secessionists that the PLA is making concrete steps in preparing for such an operation, and also in telling the US that the PLA has the capability and determination to carry out a reunification-by-force operation if peaceful reunification becomes beyond reach, Xu said.Chinese mainland military observers also noted the concentrated deployment of unmanned equipment in the drills, including aerial reconnaissance drones, unmanned obstacle-breaking ships and unmanned ground vehicles for both attack and transport purposes.The deployment of drones in the sky, on the ground and in the sea can significantly boost the efficiency of island seizure combat by lowering the casualty rate of the attacking forces, providing intelligence support and extra firepower, and replace humans in physical work, analysts said, noting that if a war breaks out, many Taiwan soldiers will have been killed before even seeing a real PLA soldier.

"State security agency uncovers hundreds of Taiwan espionage activities against mainlandnSources with the Chinese mainland’s state security agency recently revealed to the Global Times that a member of a Taiwan separatist group who had been arrested in Shenzhen in 2019 for endangering national security spied on the mainland’s armed police deployment in Shenzhen, and sent photos and videos he took of the deployment to the Taiwan separatist group. The case is a typical example of Taiwan interference in Hong Kong affairs during the 2019 turmoil in the city, state security sources said. Lee Meng-chu, a Taiwan resident, was said to have gone “missing” after crossing the border from Hong Kong into the mainland city of Shenzhen in August 2019. A Chinese mainland spokesperson confirmed in September 2019 that Lee was detained by the mainland on suspicion of engaging in criminal activities that endanger national security and was under investigation. Lee, who was born in 1972 in Hsinchu of China’s Taiwan, headed a Taiwan photoelectric technology firm and was a counselor in the Fangliao township in Pingtung county on Taiwan island. According to the sources from the state security agency, Lee is also a member of a Taiwan separatist organization “Taiwan United Nations Alliance (TAIUNA).” He is accused of taking many videos and photos of the mainland’s armed police deployment in Shenzhen during last year’s Hong Kong unrest, which he sent to the Taiwan separatist group. According to public reports, the separatist organization “Taiwan United Nations Alliance” has been actively pushing for Taiwan’s inclusion in the UN or the World Health Organization for many years, and has connections with some anti-China politicians overseas. In late August 2019, Lee was caught and investigated by the state security agency in Shenzhen according to law. According to Lee’s confession, his separatist ideas were formed before he joined the “Taiwan United Nations Alliance” in 2009. In 2001, while he was studying in the US, he became involved with Taiwan separatists in New York. After Lee returned to Taiwan, he was recommended to join the “Taiwan United Nations Alliance” and sponsored fund-raising banquets for the organization every year. He also actively tried to build connections with senior Taiwan separatist politicians including the current Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen, and was promoted to the senior member of the organization, according to Lee’s confession.

"Few want to see a ‘scorched earth’ Taiwan if war breaks out: former KMT chairpersonnEditor's Note: Since Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came into power four years ago, cross-Straits relations have retrogressed as the DPP has refused to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus and fanned separatist sentiments on the island. Meanwhile, selling weapons to Taiwan and passing bills supporting separatists on the island, the US has been trying to leverage the island to disrupt China's reunification efforts. Former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairperson Hung Hsiu-chuhas been repeatedly threatened by the separatist DPP over her steadfast pro-reunification stance. The following is a transcript of Global Timesreporter Fan Lingzhi's latest exclusive interview with Hung. The view of Taipei Photo: VCG Hung Hsiu-chu Photo: cnsphoto The 2019 Cross-Strait Marathon concludes in Kunshan, East China's Jiangsu Province, on March 24, 2019. Photo: IC Hung: Cross-Straits relations experienced dramatic change this year. The Tsai authority escalating the anti-China campaign, together with the US presidential election and its ""China-bashing"" tone, quickly facilitated US-Taiwan relations. Tsai's full power on the stage, and weakened supervision from the opposite parties, also accelerated the deterioration of Taiwan's relations with the mainland.The US is well aware that the Taiwan question is a core issue of vital importance to the Chinese mainland, so it drove up the ""Taiwan card"" by increasing levels of official engagement to bolster its leverage against China.Tsai, who advocates preventing China from ""subjugating"" the island, attempted to convince the public that the US would support her and has sufficient capacity and willingness to guarantee the security of Taiwan. The move is intended to consolidate the DPP's power.However, as a country oriented by practical interests, the US will require Tsai to pay a price in trade deals, along with the US pushing arms sales to the island, if Tsai maintains its risky gamble on the US.Ractopamine-enhanced US pork and overaged US beef exported to Taiwan may be just the beginning. The bigger risks would be a request for lower taxes on agricultural imports, cars and energy, as well as scrutiny and interference with Taiwan's currency controls.Hung: First, in the Joint Communiqué in Shanghai (also known as the Shanghai Communiqué) the US and China signed on February 28, 1972, the US acknowledges that ""all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States Government does not challenge that position.""Second, the US' Taiwan Relations Act [enacted in 1979] stated that ""any effort to determine Taiwan's future by other than peaceful means is of grave concern to the United States."" In other words, for the security of Taiwan, the US did not give any specific assurances or measurements other than its ""grave concern.""Third, the Taipei Act, signed by US President Donald Trump in March, was designed to emphasize US support for Taiwan's ""informal partnerships"" with other countries, rather than formal state-to-state diplomatic relations.Hung: Before and after the ECFA was signed in 2010, the DPP obstructed it with all kinds of slurs, calling it ""sugarcoated poison"" and ""an asymmetric treaty."" However, today, ironically, the Tsai authority has publicly called on the mainland not to stop the ECFA.Moreover, the DPP promotes the ECFA but is unwilling to recognize the 1992 Consensus on which the ECFA was signed, which has naturally shaken public confidence in the renewal of the ECFA.ECFA is the litmus test to see if the Tsai government is sincere in seeking the well-being of the people.If the ECFA fails to proceed, three economic dilemmas will immediately emerge in Taiwan: First, given that the mainland is Taiwan's most important import and export market, if the ECFA is terminated, the core programs on the ""early harvest"" list of the agreement will also come to an end, hurting small and medium-sized businesses, especially those hit by the epidemic.Second, Taiwan's products will lose their global competitiveness. If Taiwan is excluded from both the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and ECFA, the average tariff on products on the ""early harvest"" list exported to the mainland will be raised to 7.3 percent (equivalent to the average tariff rate in non-FTA regions).Third, after ""decoupling with the mainland"" in the economic and industrial chain, Taiwan may have to pay higher prices in order to make up profits from economic and trade deals with the US, a country that always stresses the most realistic and practical interests.Hung: It cannot be denied that the ""pro-independence"" atmosphere has been more noticeable in the Taiwan society. This may be because of political manipulation of the reunification or independence polls, and the defeat of the KMT in several elections which shook the confidence within the KMT. Some KMT members suspect the party has lost the mainstream public support, and even become increasingly hesitant to say ""I am Chinese.""Now, the latest poll in Taiwan shows that the acceptance and satisfaction of DPP's Tsai authority are at a high level. But I want to emphasize that ""public opinion is like flowing water; the water supporting a ship can also upset it."" It is possible that the people's sentiment will change accordingly. To regain the confidence of Taiwan people, the KMT strives and must believe that the cross-Straits policy it proposes is the best choice for the people.Hung: US sales of arms to Taiwan continues. The US lifting the strategic position and tactical capabilities of Taiwan island shows its strategy toward China has been increasingly clear and tough.The US plays the ""Taiwan card"" and sells arms to the island. The US does not need to go into battle. US' strategic benefits are maximized and the cost is minimized. But for the island of Taiwan, it could be an unbearable burden.Modern war is all-round. There is nowhere for people to escape. When the situation in the Taiwan Straits is approaching the danger of an arms race and war, there will be no winners on either side of the Straits. This also shows the importance for both sides of the Straits to manage the crisis and value peace.Hung: Ma Ying-jeou's ""The first battle is the last,"" quoted from the report of the ""Institute for National Defense and Security Research"" funded by the Taiwan authorities, was mainly to remind and explain the mainland's current strategy ""the first battle is a decisive battle, so that it could be finished before the US army arrives.""As a result, the ""pro-US and anti-China"" green camp and ""independence"" groups were dissatisfied and criticized Ma for ""surrendering sovereignty."" It is the rhetoric of the DPP and not worth refuting.But I want to emphasize that instead of caring about ""When to fight? How to fight? How long can it last? And will the US come to help?"" I would first ask that Taiwan was originally a ""peace dove,"" why should it become a ""hedgehog?"" Why start a war? Who is going to start the war? Who will benefit? Who will be the victim?We have seen that the atmosphere for fierce warfare between the two sides of the Straits is indeed rising. However, further analysis shows that there are only four types of people who want conflicts and war in the Taiwan Straits. The first type is those who never seriously faced the terrible effects of war. The second are those with wishful thinking that the US can be relied on. The third are those who think they have a way out and can stay out of it. The fourth and most abominable ones are those who want to make a war fortune.It must be very serious, once a war starts, no one can stand aside. Except for the above four types of people, most people are unwilling to go to war. They can't bear the island of Taiwan becoming a scorched earth. Once the war starts, no one can stay out of it.""The art of war is of vital importance to the state. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected,"" as illustrated in The Art of War, an ancient Chinese military treatise. Once a war breaks out in the Taiwan Straits, it is no longer a question of victory or defeat, but whether we the Chinese people should continue to kill each other? This is a historical responsibility that both sides of the Straits must seriously face together. "	10/11/20	1	0	-0.9969	-1

"India's BJP leader's Taiwan posters near Chinese embassy will further sour ties: analystsnChina India Photo:VCG Hundreds of posters celebrating the ""national day"" of Taiwan island hung outside China's Embassy to India in New Delhi will only exasperate already soured China-India ties, Chinese experts warned Saturday, urging India's ruling party to give up its irrational behavior and to realize it is playing with fire.Local media reports said hundreds of posters wishing China's Taiwan island ""a happy national day"" were hung along streets in front of the embassy. Wording on the posters show they were arranged by Delhi BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga.The move came as Indian media advocated and supported the Taiwan island celebrating a ""national day"" and a spokesperson for the Indian foreign ministry defended India's media's right to publish its own views even if they don't respect the one-China policy.The Chinese embassy on October 7 emailed India mainstream media urging them not to break with the long-time position of the Indian government's support of the one-China policy, which is viewed as a foundation for diplomatic relations.India's provocation on the Taiwan question will cause an ""irreversible"" impact on China-India ties, Chinese analysts said.Zhao Gancheng, director of the Center for Asia-Pacific Studies at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies, said ""India is playing with fire by challenging the one-China policy.""Through inciting anti-China sentiments domestically for the sake of its own interests on the Taiwan question and to rally support over border tensions, the Indian government is pushing away China as a good neighbor, Zhao said, noting India should not be surprised if consequences including plunging economic and people-to-people exchanges.Chinese analysts pointed out that although the Indian government still openly adheres to the one-China policy, it often shrugs off the media coverage calling for breaks with the policy in the name of ""freedom of the press.""The nationalist BJP has been unscrupulously provoking the Taiwan question under the surface of India-China ties, and has crossed China's bottom line as it plays the Taiwan card thinking it is a bargaining chip in dealing with China, Hu Zhiyong, a research fellow at the Institute of International Relations of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Saturday.This provocation will not bring any good to India, and will only fuel soured bilateral tensions and even damage the established strategic partnership of the two countries, Hu said.India has taken almost no action to deescalate tensions after the five-point consensus was reached last month in Moscow, and has instead reinforced its military deployment in the region. This has forced the Chinese military to prepare to handle any situation along the border, Chinese experts said earlier. "	10/10/20	0	0	0.9197	1
"Taiwan’s military drills ‘a futile cover-up show’ against PLA operationsnFour WZ-10 attack helicopters attached to an army aviation brigade under the PLA 72nd Group Army fly in tactical formation over the ocean during maritime penetrating flight training in late September, 2020. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Zhang Huanpeng) The military on the island of Taiwan reportedly started on Friday a set of exercises off the coast where the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) of the mainland have been frequently conducting drills and patrols since mid-September. While analysts on the island claim the exercises were designed to counter those of the PLA, many recent events indicate weaknesses of the Taiwan military and mainland experts say Taiwan drills shall yield no significant changes to the overwhelming advantage the PLA has over it.The naval and air forces of Taiwan are holding exercises southwest off the coast of the island on Friday, with more similar drills scheduled for October 22 and 27, the Taipei-based newspaper the Liberty Times reported.Citing experts on the island, the report said that the drills could feature warships capable of regional air defense, anti-submarine helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft and submarines, with the aim of countering recent PLA operations in the region and showing the military on the island ""has full monitoring capability"" over the region.Taiwan's exercises are a dangerous but futile attempt of resisting reunification by force, however, it will only further raise tensions in the Taiwan Straits without changing the power imbalance between the island and the mainland, a Beijing-based military analyst told the Global Times on Friday on the condition of anonymity.Despite the Taiwan exercises, the PLA conducted a sortie to this particular air zone on Friday morning, according to a separate Liberty Times report on Friday.Taiwan's exercises are also a ""show"" meant to cover up its military's weaknesses and inabilities exposed over the past weeks amid drills by the PLA, the analyst said.For example, a PLA KJ-500 early warning aircraft entered Taiwan's self-proclaimed southwest air defense identification zone (ADIZ) on Wednesday. Taiwan's defense authority was able to detect it, but it used a file photo of the KJ-500, indicating the Taiwan military failed to take a new photo. Many other PLA activities spotted by Taiwan military observers via open source intelligence were also not released by Taiwan's defense authority.This shows Taiwan's claim of having ""full monitoring capability"" is false, the analyst said.As of Wednesday, the PLA has conducted 217 sorties in Taiwan's southwest ""ADIZ,"" forcing Taiwan's military to conduct 2,972 sorties that have cost NT$25.5 billion ($891.3 million,) Yen Teh-fa, head of Taiwan's defense authority, was quoted by Taiwan's Central News Agency as saying on that day.The PLA sorties are ""wearing out"" the military on the island, observers said.On Thursday, an outdated M41A3 light tank of the Taiwan military crashed into a telegraph pole during an exercise, leading to the death of one crew member.The PLA has overwhelming military advantages over the island in terms of combat readiness of the troops, the advanced level of technology for weapons and equipment, numbers, tactics and strategies, mainland experts said.

"Czech reaffirms One-China principle in positive move to save ties soured by Senate leader’s Taiwan tripnA view of the empty Old Town Square in Prague, the Czech Republic Photo: Xinhua The Czech Republic reaffirmed its long-standing position to the one-China principle after refusing the head of the Czech Senate Milos Vystrčil to join a foreign policy meeting due to his unwarranted and unauthorized visit to the island of Taiwan, which was a dangerous move seen as seriously violating bilateral ties between China and Czech.Political observers regard the counter-measure against Vystrčil’s trip as a positive move to save China-Czech relations. But many also call on the Czech Republic to keep its words and deeds consistent, given that certain senior Czech politicians have repeatedly broken promises and heightened political interactions with Taiwan.A joint statement from top officials confirmed that the Czech Republic recognizes the one-China principle on September 29 at the latest meeting of the highest constitutional officials. This included the president, the prime minister, and the heads of the lower and upper house of the Czech Parliament.""Evolving relations with China under the 2016 declaration on strategic partnership, while honoring principles of mutual respect, convenience, and respect for the sovereignty of the other party, is in the interest of the Czech Republic. The Senate President's trip to Taiwan cannot be considered a sign of any change in this policy,"" they stated, telling that within the one-China principle, Czech is still interested in deepening economic and cultural relations with Taiwan. Taiwan Photo: Pixabay Czech Senate Speaker Miloš Vystrčil was not invited for the meeting by Czech Republic President Milos Zeman – because the trip to Taiwan was not approved by the president or other constitutional officials, local media reported.The punishment for Vystrčil away from the foreign policy meeting stems from the Czech central government’s obvious alert that some individual politicians are willing to sacrifice their country’s national interests for short-term petty favors with Taiwan, Yang Lixian, a research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center of Cross-Straits Relations, told the Global Times on Monday. These dangerous interactions were conducted by very few people who are unable to represent mainstream Czech voices, as we learn from their statement, Yang said.Czech and China have deepened their friendship during the fight against the coronavirus, as President Zeman expressed gratitude to China for providing valuable support and assistance to Czech. Zeman also stressed his plans to further promote cooperation and his expectations to visit China again soon.The Czech government’s statement also tells, once again, that desperate enticements from Taiwan separatist authority will be futile in persuading Prague to change its political relations, Yang added.Vystrčil traveled to the island of Taiwan at the end of August. He is the highest-ranking official of the Czech Republic to ever visit the island, together with other 89 delegates including the Prague mayor Zdenek Hrib. The latter politician promoted the Czech capital to sign a sister city agreement with Taipei in January 2020 while cutting a similar agreement with Beijing.But the visit drew strong protests from both the Chinese central government and Czech because Vystčil’s trip was an unauthorized – an unwise – move by Czech’s second-highest constitutional representative.Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that Vystrčil would pay a high price for violating the one-China principle.The Chinese embassy in Prague stated that Vystrčil’s visit grossly violated the national sovereignty of China and seriously interfered in Chinese internal affairs.On the other side, Zeman slammed the visit a ""boyish provocation.” This statement was seen by analysts as trying to put out the fire from this political farce.Czech’s Prime Minister Andrej Babiš also accused Vystrčil of mixing politics with business and violating the principle.“Relations between China and the Czech experienced a blow in diplomatic ties largely due to escalated interactions between Czech politicians and the island of Taiwan. The quick response and reaffirmed stance from Czech this time partly soothed the already bruised relations, but it remains unclear how binding and effective it will be in practice,” Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Monday.We call on the Czech central government, which holds diplomatic power, to redefine the rules and frameworks governing the conduct of its officials in order to maintain a long-term and solid confidence-building mechanism with China, Cui said.

"PLA continues drills, patrols in Taiwan Straits during national holidaysnA pilot assigned to an aviation brigade of the air force under the PLA Southern Theater Command gives his regards to ground crews before taxiing out during a real-combat flight training exercise in mid September, 2020. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Wang Guoyun) The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is apparently continuing its combat-oriented exercises and combat readiness patrols in the Taiwan Straits, as it reportedly sent warplanes to the region again on Sunday, marking the fourth consecutive day since the start of the eight-day National Day and Mid-Autumn holiday period on Thursday. It also seems as if the PLA’s sorties are wearing out the military on the Taiwan island, observers said on Sunday.A PLA warplane, presumably a Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft, again entered Taiwan’s self-proclaimed southwestern “air defense identification zone” on Sunday morning, the Taipei-based newspaper the Liberty Times reported on the same day, citing local military enthusiasts who recorded open broadcasts by the island’s armed forces to the PLA aircraft.The sortie marks the fourth consecutive day the PLA has sent warplanes near the Taiwan island since the start of October, and the eight-day National Day and Mid-Autumn holiday period on the Chinese mainland, the report said.According to the Twitter account of island of Taiwan’s defense authority, it was able to identify two PLA Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft in its southwestern “air defense identification zone” on Thursday and Saturday respectively. Military observers said the island’s defense authority often does not disclose all PLA activities due to either its unwillingness to expose weaknesses, or inability to detect and identify the PLA warplanes.The frequent PLA warplane sorties, which have even taken place on national holidays, demonstrate the PLA’s capability and determination in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, a Chinese mainland military expert, who asked not to be identified, told the Global Times on Sunday.Beijing-based military expert Li Jie told the Global Times that by deploying reconnaissance aircraft, like the Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft, the PLA has been increasing the intensity of patrols, as well as search and reconnaissance missions, in order to gain more intelligence, with the goal of providing basic information and creating advantageous conditions for its future maritime activities and combat operations.The concentrated PLA operations also seem to be depleting the will of the military on the Taiwan island as they result in huge pressure being applied on the island’s logistics support services, Chinese mainland analysts said.Citing data released by island’s defense authority, media on the island reported on Sunday that the Chinese mainland has conducted 51 warplane sorties in 16 days since mid-September. In response to the PLA’s operations, the island has scrambled warplanes and spent more than NT$100 million ($3.46 million) in fuel expenses, maintenance, logistics support and stand-by costs, the report said.Every aircraft has an expiry date, and they eventually go beyond repair, malfunction and need to be scraped, particularly when they are not well maintained, the expert said, noting that each time Taiwan scrambles its warplanes, they move one step closer to the junk yard.The PLA already has significantly more aircraft than military on the island, and the mainland’s defense industry can continuously build more aircraft at better quality, the expert said.In addition to warplane sorties, the PLA also seemingly sent a warship to the waters off Hualien, a county off the east coast of Taiwan, on Friday, the Liberty Times reported on Sunday.

"HK murder hopes to surrender to Taiwan in OctobernChan Tong-kai, a Hong Kong citizen accused of murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan last year, bows in front of the media as he leaves the city’s Pik Uk Prison on Wednesday. Photo: VCG Hong Kong murder suspect Chan Tong-kai ̶ whose case lead to the proposed extradition bill that sparked months of social unrest in Hong Kong last year ̶ has notified his lawyer on the island of Taiwan to pave the way for his surrender to accept trial on the island, saying he hopes it could be arranged in October.Chan said his willingness to surrender to the island of Taiwan has never changed, and he expressed deep sorrow to the parents of the victim, also his girlfriend Poon Hiu-wing, Peter Koon Ho-ming, provincial secretary general of the Anglican church in Hong Kong, told the Global Times on Friday.The authority on the island of Taiwan also said on Friday that it has established the relevant communication channels with Hong Kong police on Chan’s surrender, and is well prepared for the relevant work.Koon told the Global Times previously that due to various reasons (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), the surrender of Chan, the Hong Kong man who killed his girlfriend in Taipei and was released from prison last October for money laundering, had been suspended for some months, and Koon wanted to fly to Taiwan to discuss the upcoming procedures with Taiwan lawyers as soon as the travel restrictions between Taiwan and Hong Kong are lifted.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said at a press conference on Tuesday that the Hong Kong Special Administration Region (HKSAR) government is willing to offer assistance to bring about Chan's surrender.Lam said Chan is a free man under Hong Kong law and there is nothing more they can do under the current judicial system, while expressing sympathy and condolences to the parents of his victim, Poon Hiu-wing.Lam said she learned from Koon that Chan feels guilty and is willing to bear legal responsibility.Only after Chan surrenders himself and accepts the punishment of the law can he really become a free man, Koon said.

"US kidnaps and controls Taiwan’s futurenWang Zaixi Photo: Li Hao/GT Tensions are high across the Taiwan Straits, and an increasing number of Western media outlets ask if an outbreak of war is possible in the region. Are the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA)’s drills in the Taiwan Straits a strategic deterrent or prelude to war? What is behind the current US administration’s Taiwan policy? Where will the situation head after the US presidential election in November? Wang Zaixi (), former deputy director of the Beijing-based Association for Relations across the Taiwan Straits, shared his insights with the Global Times ().The recent combat exercises of the PLA Eastern Theater Command in the Taiwan Straits are aimed at dealing with the current situation. The duration, scale and level of these exercises are unprecedented. Their purpose is to deter “Taiwan independence” forces and to issue a stern warning to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities; that is, if they think they can do whatever they want with the support and protection of the US, and dare to take a crucial step on the path of pursuing “Taiwan independence,” the Chinese mainland will be forced to take military actions to solve the Taiwan question, bringing disaster to Taiwan compatriots.The military exercises are also aimed to warn the US that the Taiwan question is an internal matter of China that does not allow for foreign interference. The US sent its deputy secretary of state to attend the funeral of former Taiwan regional leader Lee Teng-hui, the “godfather of Taiwan independence.” The intentions of this action are extremely sinister. The US not only intends to promote official relations with the island of Taiwan, but it also obviously emboldens those Taiwan separatists.There is no room for compromise when it comes to China’s core interests. I hope that the DPP authorities will take the mainland’s red line seriously and never underestimate the firm determination and strong will of the 1.4 billion people on the mainland in defending national sovereignty and territory. Whether it is a prelude to war or not depends on the DPP authorities’ next actions.Yes. The recent course of actions taken by the US on the Taiwan question has become increasingly outrageous. Despite China's warnings, the Trump administration approved the sale of advanced weapons and equipment to the island of Taiwan, including offensive weapons, sent its minister of health and deputy secretary of state to visit Taiwan, and made various excuses for US military aircraft and ships to reach Taiwan. These actions have made US-Taiwan relationship break through the civil framework and changed its nongovernmental nature. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the US, successive US presidents have adhered to the basic position of pursuing the one-China policy and not supporting ""Taiwan independence."" After Trump was elected, however, in order to contain and suppress China, he has significantly adjusted US strategy and policy toward Taiwan. First, instead of ""not supporting Taiwan independence,"" he has openly encouraged and supported it. Second, instead of advocating for the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, he blatantly and deliberately creates tensions. China sincerely hopes that China-US relations can develop normally and healthily, and that the Taiwan question can be resolved peacefully. The US policy toward China and the island of Taiwan is now heading more and more off track. This may cause certain obstacles to China's economic development and modernization process in the short run. But in the long run, even if there are twists and turns in China's development, it is impossible to stop it.The Trump administration’s Taiwan policy is mainly driven by political interests, but he also benefits economically. For the US, playing the “Taiwan card” has little costs, but the impacts and harm it causes to China are great. The US trade war, technological war, financial war and diplomatic war against China are mutually damaging. It does not cost the US anything to send a few officials to the island of Taiwan, utter a few words to support Taiwan, or sell weapons and equipment to boost Taiwan’s inventory. Playing the so-called Taiwan card is a cost-effective means which will cause great harm.In addition, the US can also reap economic benefits from Taiwan, such as from its arms sales to the island. This is the most profitable business and it is done at a fixed price, and Taiwan authorities don’t have any opportunity to bargain. The US recently sent its secretary of health to Taiwan, and immediately demanded that Taiwan import pork and beef from the US despite the US meat contain clenbuterol, as it couldn’t offend the US after the latter showed its support to Taiwan. Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen is prepared to take the risk of importing unhealthy beef and pork from the US, despite receiving opposition from the majority of people in Taiwan. Trump is a businessman. He gains both political and economic interests when he plays the Taiwan card and it seems to be that Tsai herself is willing to be taken advantage of.Since Trump launched trade war against China, interactions between the US and the island of Taiwan have become more frequent. Obviously, the US has repeatedly used the Taiwan card as the most effective trump card against China.Objectively speaking, the US and the island of Taiwan have common needs in containing the development of the Chinese mainland, and their strategic interests are mostly consistent. In order to contain the peaceful rise of China and hinder China’s modernization, the US will definitely make every effort to make use of the Taiwan question to attack China and make waves in China. The DPP authorities are well aware that if they rely on their own strength, Taiwan can hardly act as a counterweight to the mainland. It must rely on protection from the US and thus obtain more opportunities in the international community.In this case, Tsai willingly and proactively threw herself into the arms of the US, catering to and cooperating with the US to provoke the Chinese mainland. To some extent, Taiwan is now deeply controlled by the US. From my perspective, if China-US relations continue to deteriorate in the future, US-Taiwan relations will become closer, and cross-Straits relations will remain tense or even become tenser, even after the US presidential election. It is worth noting that the US is now promoting the US-Taiwan cooperation in the military field both overtly and covertly. The US deliberately emboldens and conspires with those “Taiwan independence” forces to stir up troubles for the Chinese mainland, hoping that if Taiwan and the mainland fight, the US can reap the spoils. If DPP authorities really think their engagement in “Taiwan independence” ensures their protection by the US, it will be a historical mistake that would lead to disastrous consequences.Fundamentally speaking, US-Taiwan relations depend on China-US relations. The US and the island of Taiwan will become distant only when China-US relations improve.The “median line” has only been a unilateral line drawn by the Taiwan “Air Force” as a buffer line for air force activities on both sides of the Taiwan Straits. The state of military hostilities between the two sides of the straits have not ended and a military confidence-building mechanism has not been established so far, so the Taiwan military has never negotiated with the Chinese mainland military on the “median line” and therefore it has never been recognized.In terms of territory, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. The mainland air force has the right to fly, train and patrol in its own airspace.There is no question of whether flying over the “median line” is border-crossing. In my view, in order to ensure peace and security above the Taiwan Straits, the military or relevant departments on both sides should sit down and discuss this under the premise of the one-China principle. This is purely an internal issue of China and has nothing to do with the US. The US has no right to intervene. "	10/2/20	0	0	0.9646	1
"Taiwan regional authority reverses decision on murder suspect amid public pressurenRioters damage facilities on the Jordan Road in Hong Kong on Sunday. Photo: Xinhua Taiwan's regional authority on Tuesday reversed its rejection of the offer to surrender by the murder suspect Chan Tong-kai from Hong Kong, a move that analysts said was a result of pressure from public opinion and disapproval of the island authorities' attempt to politicize the judicial issue.Speaking at a press conference in Taipei on Tuesday, officials from Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said that it hopes Hong Kong will assist in bringing Chan back for trial in Taiwan and will not let a serious crime go unpunished, Taiwan-based China Times reported Tuesday.The council said that it had required the Hong Kong authorities to offer judicial help many times since the case happened last year and it is also willing to provide evidence to the Hong Kong regional government, but the latter showed no willingness to start a trial for the case.Previously, the Taiwan authority had rejected Chan's surrender as they believed it was the result of manipulation or political motives by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government.Hong Kong and the island of Taiwan have been tussling over Chan's case for some time.Hong Kong Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said on Tuesday morning that it was baffling that the island of Taiwan had rejected Chan's surrender, and urged Taiwan not to put politics over justice.At Tuesday's media briefing, Cheung reiterated that no political manipulation was involved in Chan's case, and said he hoped that the Taiwan authorities won't complicate the issue and try to exploit politics at the expense of justice.Zhu Songling, a professor with the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Beijing Union University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that Taiwan's decision could be seen as a surrender to strong calls from the public and legal circles in the island not to politicize the issue and return it to the law.It shows that the Tsai Ing-wen administration's intention to politicize the issue is unpopular with the people, Zhu noted.The administration's rejection of Chan's surrender resulted in a backlash in the island as well as in Hong Kong. The media and politicians criticized the behavior as ""dodging responsibility"" and politicizing a legal issue.Former Taiwan leader Ma Ying-jeou said on his Facebook account on Tuesday that he was sad about the rejection, which revealed that Tsai's administration was more interested in votes than justice.Chan is wanted in Taiwan on murder charges and stands accused of killing his pregnant girlfriend during a holiday early last year. He later returned to Hong Kong, where he was arrested and convicted of money laundering. He is due to be released on Wednesday. "	10/23/19	0	0	-0.9923	-1
"Seeking 'independence' via 'constitutional amendment' will get Taiwan secessionists burned: Taiwan Affairs OfficenFighter jets conduct elephant walk during a round-the-clock combat power exercise organized by an aviation brigade of the air force under the PLA Northern Theater Command on January 8, 2020.Photo:China Military A small group of Taiwan secessionists shouldn't underestimate Beijing's resolution in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity and should not go further in the evil road of seeking independence through ""constitutional amendments,"" the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council said Wednesday at a regular press conference. ""They should stop playing with fire or they will get themselves burned,"" Ma Xiaoguang, the spokesperson for the office, warned.It's reported that the Taiwan ""Legislature"" decided to set up a committee pushing for ""constitutional amendments"" starting in the new term.

Responding to this, Ma said that this is a blunt act of seeking ""independence.""Ma said the mainland will give high attention to the silly moves of the small group of Taiwan secessionists. Seeking independence via ""constitutional amendments"" will only drag the island of Taiwan into a serious disaster, Ma said.

The island's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration's threats and intimidation against people in Taiwan who communicate with the mainland are merely arbitrary condemnations, Ma said.Global Times "	9/30/20	0	0	0.9761	1
"Taiwan residents worry about war: surveysnMore than 100 political advisors and experts attend the 12th Straits Forum held in the port city of Xiamen in Fujian Province on site or via video link. China's top political advisor Wang Yang addressed the forum via video link. Photo: csnphoto Residents in the island of Taiwan are worrying in an unprecedented way that cross-Straits tension may escalate into a war, as surveys conducted in the island showed that perceptions of official and military relations with the Chinese mainland have worsened. However, a majority of respondents hoped for peaceful talks with the mainland.An annual survey on cross-Straits relations conducted by Taiwan newspaper the United Daily News showed that more than half of the respondents felt that tensions between the Chinese mainland and the island are record high, the newspaper reported on Monday.In the survey, 61 percent believed that the two sides are in a highly competitive situation, and 24 percent believed that relations are easing. Only 7 percent thought that the possibility of war is declining. The respondents' comments on cross-Straits political ties were similar to last year's survey.Only 7 percent of the respondents said the two sides are in close contact, a decline of 4 percentage points from last year. There was also a decline in those who believed that cross-Straits ties are stable. This category fell from 32 percent to 27 percent. Those who felt tensions had increased from 49 percent to 53 percent, a record high for this survey.Those who felt that military tensions between the two sides had worsened rose from 50 percent to 54 percent, a record high. Only 18 percent felt that military tensions had eased.The survey came amid constant hype in the Taiwan media over the activities of People's Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft in the ""airspace"" around Taiwan. On Monday, local media reported that PLA aircraft had entered the southwest ""air defense identification zone"" of Taiwan at 6:47 am for the 13th consecutive day. On September 18, Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang, a Ministry of National Defense spokesperson, said at a press conference that starting on September 18, the PLA Eastern Theater Command would conduct real combat-oriented exercises near the Taiwan Straits.The move, which targets the current cross-Straits situation, is a legitimate and necessary action that the Chinese mainland is taking to protect its sovereignty and integrity, Ren said, stressing that the PLA has the firm willingness, full confidence and ability to defeat all outside forces that interfere with the Taiwan question.Another survey released by Taiwan magazine Global Views Monthly on Friday showed that if a war broke out, 54.2 percent of the respondents wished for peaceful talks with the mainland, 22.3 percent expected help from the US, and 16.5 percent said the island should fight.""The result is in line with the current situation in Taiwan,"" said Zhang Wensheng, a deputy dean of the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University, in East China's Fujian Province.""Most people in the island of Taiwan don't want a war but hope for peaceful cross-Straits ties,"" Zhang told the Global Times on Monday.No matter whether the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) or the Kuomintang Party rules the island, they hope that the authorities could handle cross-Straits relations correctly and ensure peace across the Taiwan Straits, he said.In that case, peaceful talks would be the priority among the three options, he said.Zhang further noted that peaceful talks were also a promise made by Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen to residents before she took office, as she claimed she was capable of ensuring peace across the Taiwan Straits.However, as the situation has deteriorated, and the two sides are in a state of extreme tension, war is not impossible. But, the consequences of a war will be borne by the majority of local residents, he said. The findings of the survey will create some pressure on the DPP authorities, he said.People-to-people exchanges remained positive, with 26 percent of respondents believing that exchanges are lively and 43 percent feeling that relations among people have eased.The recently held Straits Forum in the Chinese mainland for cross-Straits people-to-people exchanges was thought to show that the mainland is handling the complicated situation with ""two hands"" - supporting exchanges and cooperation to serve the concrete benefits of Taiwan compatriots on the one hand, and increasing military pressure to deter Taiwan separatism and the Trump administration on the other hand, which is increasingly throwing its weight around on the Taiwan question.

"DPP ‘self-deceiving’ in seeking secessionist presence of Taiwan in intl organizationsnTaiwan Photo: Pixabay The separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities on the island of Taiwan protested against an international organization that listed the island in ""China,"" and urged a separate category of Chinese Taipei, but analysts noted such self-deception will not change the fact that it is an inalienable part of Chinese territory.Six cities on the Taiwan island, including Kaohsiung, are members of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, a coalition to address climate change that was founded in 2016. Kaohsiung's new mayor Chen Chi-mai, together with other mayors, asked the organization not to list Taiwan as part of China, claiming that was degrading to the island.The Global Times found that the six cities are now listed on the organization's website under Chinese Taipei. The Hong Kong Special Administration is also a member. No Chinese mainland city has joined the coalition.The organization told the Global Times that the classification of the six cities was a ""technical error"" that occurred during a recent database update, and it has since been ""fixed.""Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Monday stressed that there is only one China and the island of Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.The ""Taiwan region must abide by the one-China principle when it participates in international organizations,"" Wang said.The change was hailed by Taiwan and some biased Western media as a big success in seeking a secessionist presence for the island, but analysts said that the DPP should not deceive itself, because the one-China principle has been widely recognized in the international community.The DPP thought it had underscored its presence worldwide, but Chinese Taipei was actually used within the framework of the one-China principle, Lü Cuncheng, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday.""Its self-deceiving success actually reinforces global recognition of the principle,"" Lü said.There are numerous nongovernmental, region-region organizations, and the Taiwan island could be representative of a Chinese region in these groups. For Taiwan compatriots' sake, the Chinese mainland practices goodwill and does not oppose Taiwan's communication with other parts of the world in economic and cultural affairs, Lü said, noting ""The bottom line is no organization could refer to Taiwan as a sovereign country or violate the one-China principle.""Birdlife International, a global bird conservation organization, recently removed a Taiwan organization from its partner list as the latter refused to sign a document promising that it would not promote or advocate the secession of Taiwan from China.

"Taiwan ‘puts all eggs in one basket’ by refusing mainland vaccinesnvaccine Photo:Li Hao/GT Experts warned that the island of Taiwan is ""putting all its eggs in one basket"" as island officials said that they would not purchase COVID-19 vaccines from the Chinese mainland, even though the mainland has an apparent advantage in vaccine research and development by contributing four of the world's nine COVID-19 candidate vaccines undergoing Phase III clinical trials.On Friday, the Taiwan island's health department head Chen Shih-chung said that the island had signed a contract with the World Health Organization and would obtain vaccines from the organization's COVAX facility. It noted that it would not purchase vaccines from the mainland, claiming that drugs and vaccines made on the mainland had shown many problems.Chen said the contract was signed on September 18 and the island would pay a deposit in October.Observers from both sides criticized the Taiwan regional government's move as putting politics over people's health.""If the mainland successfully produces safe vaccines and at a proper price, the government should put Taiwan residents' health as a priority,"" said a Taiwan legislator from the Kuomintang.The South China Morning Post reported on September 21 that two-dose vaccines of the China National Biotec Group (CNBG) were being those reviewed for ""conditional approval"" from the national drug regulator, and if given the green light, the vaccines would be available for at most 600 yuan ($88) for two doses.CNBG previously announced that its inactivated COVID-19 vaccines might come onto the market by the end of this year.Some other observers pointed out that the island would be left with few options if the local government refused mainland vaccines as four of the nine most likely vaccine candidates are from the mainland.Apart from the four candidates from China, another of the current nine candidates in Phase III clinical trials is from Russia and the other four are from the US or Europe.But three of them are ultra high-tech vaccines that must be delivered under -80 C, which is out of the island's current capacity, experts noted.Delivery under -70 C has very high requirements for facilities, which means that the island, if it uses such vaccines, has to rebuild its cold chain transportation facilities.On the contrary, the CNBG inactivated vaccines, as well as a recombinant vaccine developed by mainland vaccine producer CanSino Biotech Inc., can be transported with the island's current cold chain facility of 2-8 C temperatures, Tao Lina, a Shanghai-based immunological expert, told the Global Times on Sunday.

"PLA conducts recon on both sides of Taiwan to gather intel for real combat: expertsnA KJ-500 airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft attached to a naval aviation regiment under the PLA Southern Theater Command taxies on the runway before takeoff during a round-the-clock flight training exercise on August 19, 2020.Photo:China Military During its real combat-oriented exercises and combat-readiness patrols in the Taiwan Straits since last week, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has conducted intensive aerial and maritime reconnaissance missions of the island of Taiwan from both its west and east, with the number of operations surpassing that of fighter jets and bombers.The operations, aimed at gathering intelligence on the forces of Taiwan, the US and Japan including their submarine activities, troop deployments and military facility situations, will prepare the PLA for a possible future battle, Chinese mainland experts said on Sunday.Since Taiwan's defense authority has started publishing PLA aircraft activities near the island with detailed information, photos and flight paths on September 17 and as of press time on Sunday, it has announced 10 sorties by Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft on six different days. All flew above the waters to the southwest of the island.This type of aircraft again approached the island on Sunday morning, with a KJ-500 early warning aircraft flying off the coast of Shantou, South China's Guangdong Province, Taiwan media reported on Sunday, citing an open source aircraft tracking service. This marks the 12th consecutive day the PLA has entered the island's self-declared air defense identification zone, it said.By comparison, the island's defense authority only recorded two days of PLA activities involving fighter jets and bombers.On the other side of the island, on Friday, a Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft flew through the Miyako Strait from the north, turned west and headed toward the east of Taiwan, before returning by the same flight path, according to a press release by Japan's Defense Ministry Joint Staff on the same day.This is the first time a PLA warplane is known to have been spotted to the east of Taiwan since the PLA announced the exercises on September 18.Also, a PLA intelligence-gathering ship has been operating to the east of Taiwan since last week, Taiwan media reported on Sunday.The PLA has been increasing the intensity of patrols, searching and reconnaissance in order to gain more intelligence, with the goal of providing basic information and creating advantageous conditions for its future maritime activities and combat operations, Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, told the Global Times on Sunday.Particularly, the eastern waters of Taiwan were less known to the PLA, including its geological and hydrological information as well as the Taiwan military's ongoing activities, Li said, noting that the PLA would need to carry out missions in all directions around Taiwan.The Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft, the Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft and the KJ-500 early warning aircraft are all special mission aircraft developed based on the Y-8 tactical transport aircraft.The Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft is apparently equipped with an air-to-surface search radar to conduct reconnaissance on warships, and a magnetic anomaly detection tube and sonobuoys to search for submarines. Li said it can gather intelligence on submarine activities by Taiwan, the US and Japan, while also gaining knowledge of maritime geological and hydrological characteristics.The Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft can gather intelligence on hostile troops deployments, the situation in hostile bases, ports and airfields, and eventually find patterns, Li said.On Saturday, the US sent an EP-3E and a P-8A reconnaissance aircraft near the Chinese mainland over the South China Sea, according to information released by Beijing-based think tank the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI) on the same day.The SCSPI noted that the EP-3E was only 47.81 nautical miles from Guangdong, leading Taiwan media to claim it is a new record for a US warplane to conduct close-up reconnaissance on the Chinese mainland, and that the US was ""putting pressure on the PLA.""Recently, the US and Taiwan have been keeping stepping on the red line with frequent interactions, but the PLA will not just sit by and watch, Fu Qianshao, a Chinese mainland military aviation expert, told the Global Times.Increasing the intensity of military drills and normalized training in the Taiwan Straits is a clear warning to Taiwan secessionists: If they don't stop now, they are bound to be smashed into pieces, Fu said.

Such obstruction of trade has frustrated small businesses and customers in the island.Analysts noted that DPP authorities are becoming paranoid, politicizing everything to stir up confrontations with the mainland, prompting some indecent and ridiculous comments and moves.A latest example is that Taiwan media hyping up a painting at a subway station in Taipei. The picture, inspired by a Northern Song-Dynasty (960-1127) painting, uses bears as avatars of people to depict prosperous market and city views. But DPP legislator Chen E-jun claimed the black bears, a symbol of Taiwan, are always serving other bears, like brown bears, polar bears and giant pandas, which is inappropriate and disrespectful of the island.The painter said that people should not read too much into the work, which was finished in 2014, or connect it to politics.

"PLA’s J-20 stealth fighter deployment near Taiwan stokes fear, delivers warning to separatistsnTwo J-20s, China's most advanced fighter jet. perform at the Chinese Air Force's open day event in Changchun, NE China's Jilin on Thursday. Photo: VCG RELATED ARTICLES: PLA conducts drills near Taiwan Straits as US officials visit island A J-20 stealth fighter jet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) was reportedly spotted soaring through the skies above an East China city only 500 kilometers away from the island of Taiwan, sparking fear on the island and delivering a powerful warning to Taiwan separatists and the US, as the island's media reported on Saturday that Taiwan warplanes were only minutes away from the J-20's kill range if it flew toward the island.The J-20 holds a generation gap advantage over all of Taiwan's warplanes, and its involvement in a potential PLA operation on Taiwan would result in a one-sided PLA victory in the air, analysts said on Saturday.Citing an unverified video widely circulated on social media platform Sina Weibo since Friday, Taiwan media reported on Saturday that a J-20 was spotted flying low near the urban district of Quzhou, East China's Zhejiang Province. The report said it was likely in the process of landing at an air force base in the city.It is possible that the J-20 is attached to the Wang Hai Air Group based in Wuhu, East China's Anhui Province, and is being forward-deployed to Quzhou, Taiwan media speculated.Quzhou is only 500 kilometers away from Taiwan. If a J-20 takes off from Quzhou and heads toward the island, it would only take the PLA aircraft seven to eight minutes before Taiwan warplanes enter its air-to-air missile kill range, and 15 to 20 minutes before it could be right above Taipei, Taiwan media said.The PLA Eastern Theater Command has announced aerial and naval exercises in the Taiwan Straits since September 18; however, it has not yet released further details, including if it had deployed any J-20 for the drills.Meanwhile, Taiwan's defense authority has been releasing tracking reports on PLA warplane sorties near the island amid the PLA's ongoing exercises, but they did not reveal any J-20 activities.Thanks to the stealth capabilities of the J-20, even if it did take part in the exercises, Taiwan would not be able to spot it anyway, a Chinese mainland military expert told the Global Times on Saturday on the condition of anonymity.The J-20 is a fourth (or fifth, under Western classification) generation fighter jet comparable with the US' F-22. It has strong capabilities in terms of stealth, situational awareness, supermaneuverability and supersonic speed, the expert said, noting that Taiwan's most advanced aircraft is the F-16, developed by the US, which is one generation obsolete compared to the J-20, and the J-20 can single-handedly take on multiple of them.In a recent PLA combat exercise, a pilot and his teammate flying ""a new type of warplane"" faced interceptions from multiple directions, taking down 17 opposition fighter jets without receiving any damage itself, despite being heavily outnumbered, the PLA Daily reported earlier this month.Many media outlets speculated this new warplane was the J-20, and it demonstrated the stealth aircraft's absolute superiority over its previous-generation counterparts.With the J-20 already in service by the PLA Eastern Theater Command, if a war breaks out in the Taiwan Straits, it would very likely be deployed in combat, even though it would be an overkill, analysts predicted.J-20 can take down not only hostile fighters, but also key strategic targets like hostile command centers, significantly contributing to the seizure of air superiority in combat, the expert said.Chinese mainland military analysts said the recent J-20 sighting is a powerful warning to Taiwan separatists and the US amid the current cross-Straits situation. The J-20 flew very low near an urban area in daylight, as if it wanted to show off its presence, rather than to secretly conduct the mission at night, they noted.Taking advantage of its ghostly defense-penetration capabilities, the J-20 can easily launch decapitation strikes on Taiwan secessionist leaders with air-to-ground weapons, or can intercept any foreign intervention attempts with air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons, analysts said.If the Taiwan authority and the US continue to stir up trouble and challenge China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity, the J-20 could fly through Taiwan island, further showcasing its superiority over the island's military, analysts said.

"Taiwan’s high-profile missile tests no threat to PLA: expertsnFile photo:China Military The island of Taiwan's Hsiung Feng II E supersonic anti-ship missiles and its enhanced Sky Bow III surface-to-air missiles were likely at the center of a reported high-profile missile launch test on Thursday, defense experts said, adding that the weapons pose no real threat to People's Liberation Army's (PLA) ballistic missiles.Taiwan island local media reported that local weapons developer the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) launched two unnamed missiles from Jiupeng base in Pingtung county and Sanxiantai in Taitung county, at around 7:40 pm on Thursday.The two missiles simulated an interception operation after they took off to an unspecific altitude, reports said. Personnel at the site wouldn't reveal details of the tests, claiming they were merely regular tests.The NCSIST had said there was no altitude limit for the missile tests, but a 300-kilometer stretch of the Pacific - encompassing the waters off Hualien and Taitung Counties and Orchid Island - was closed off, local media reported prior of the test event.It's likely that the Hsiung Feng II E played the role of target projectile to test the interception capability of an enhanced variant of the Sky Bow III missile, Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Friday. The test only demonstrates the Sky Bow III's possible ability to intercept warplanes and cruise missiles, but not ballistic missiles.The island does not have ballistic missiles it could use to test the interception capability of its missiles, Song pointed out, while noting that in an actual military conflict, the PLA would deploy ballistic missiles to destroy the enemy's anti-aircraft missile systems before sending in warplanes.The tests also show the island does not stand a chance in a military confrontation with the mainland, Song noted.Military experts pointed out that Taiwan's missiles rely heavily on US technology, and the US would not allow the island to mass produce such weapons, requiring it to purchase them.Taiwan media said that the tests were made after PLA warplanes repeated passed the so-called midline of the Taiwan Straits.

"US arms sales won't alter power imbalance between mainland and TaiwannIllustration: Liu Rui/GT The administration of US President Donald Trump is pushing the sale of seven large packages of weapons to the island of Taiwan, according to The New York Times（NYT）. The NYT article further said that an air-to-ground missile, the AGM-84H/K SLAM-ER, is the most sensitive weapon system of the proposed packages. The missiles could hit targets on the Chinese mainland or at sea, including warships trying to cross the Taiwan Straits.In accordance with the three China-US joint communiqués, especially the August 17 Communiqué, the US government stated that it does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan. It further noted that its arms sales to Taiwan will not exceed, either in qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level of those supplied in recent years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the US and China in 1979. The Taiwan Relations Act that was enacted in 1979 also stipulates that the US shall provide Taiwan with arms that are only defensive in character.However, the air-to-ground missile included in the proposed packages of arms sales to Taiwan falls into the category of offensive weapons.As a matter of fact, Washington has violated the related rules and regulations enacted in its acts and communiqués regarding arms sales to the island of Taiwan for a long time. As early as in 1992, US F-16 warplanes, which the US sold to Taiwan, are also offensive weapons.What Beijing should consider now is how to counter the US. After all, Washington has repeatedly challenged the one-China principle and trampled the three China-US joint communiqués.Reuters said that pursuing seven sales at one time is rare. It breaks precedent with US military sales to the island. What are Washington's intensions?First, US arms dealers could earn a lot of money from such large-scale arms sales. Trump is certainly willing to do so. The arms business has always been one of the ways for the US to make money. They have sold a large amount of second-hand or non-advanced weapons and equipment to Taiwan. As such, US arms dealers can make huge profits from it.Second, the Trump administration as well as other politicians and lawmakers want to create a cross-Straits arms race to drain China's power.In addition, the US wants to intensify the cross-Straits tensions to prevent China from growing too fast. Arms sales to the island of Taiwan can certainly achieve that aim. This seriously harms China's development interests and security. It also seeks to contain China.Whereas the US continues to provoke China, this explicit deal may be approved. However, whatever the island of Taiwan buys, it will not be able to change the power imbalance between the mainland and Taiwan. The fact is that Taiwan's military capabilities are nowhere close to what the PLA can do. That is to say, one or two pieces of weapons can't change the power imbalance.With the US presidential election approaching, the Taiwan card has been played too far by Washington. Recently, a US under secretary of state visited Taiwan. The US ambassador to the United Nations met with representatives of the island too and supported its participation in UN affairs. Some lawmakers have even suggested that the US should restore ""diplomatic"" relations with Taiwan.Trump has frequently played the Taiwan card, trying to win his presidential election without any costs. It is very likely that Trump and his far-right populist constituency will pass on this proposal. Trump may, if reelected, consider establishing ""diplomatic"" relations with Taiwan. He may further promise to bring Taiwan into the international community. Even if Joe Biden is elected, the situation might be the same.In the face of this, China should not hold out hope for the US. China must maintain its strategic focus. Besides, China now needs to increase its military and economic strength. It must accumulate comprehensive national strength and be prepared for military conflicts. If the US arms sales to Taiwan are approved, the PLA and the Chinese government should impose sanctions on relevant US companies and normalize these sanctions. All US companies that violate the one-China principle should be blacklisted. This will be a deterrence for these US companies - not only companies that sell weapons, but also some affiliated companies.The author is a Chinese military expert and commentator. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	9/21/20	0	0	0.5454	1
"Deployment of US forces to Taiwan means war: Global Times editorialnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT Military Review, the professional bimonthly journal of the US Army, in its latest issue published a series of articles on the so-called China's armed invasion of Taiwan. A US Marine Corps captain in his article called for returning the US forces to Taiwan, and another article suggests providing a corps of ""two-to-four divisions... against the PLA bridgeheads"" and ""dispatching an Army heavy corps to Taiwan.""These articles have triggered a strong response in the island of Taiwan, and the Taiwan secessionist forces have been greatly encouraged. However, some have pointed out that it is unlikely the US military will publicly deploy in Taiwan.Such discussions in a US military magazine can be regarded as a public opinion war against China. The US is trying to open up new space for the US strategy to exert pressure on China. If the US military does what the magazine has suggested, it not only means the complete end of the US' one-China policy, but will also mean a blatant challenge to China's sovereignty.The release of such information seems to be carried away. The US and the island of Taiwan must give up all illusions about the redeployment of US troops in Taiwan, because it means nothing but war. The Anti-Secession Law outlined three conditions that would compel China to use force. The second condition is ""the development of major incidents that involve the independence of Taiwan from the mainland,"" and the third condition is ""the exhaustion of all options to reach a deal on the peaceful reunification."" The redeployment of US troops in Taiwan meets the two conditions. We believe that the PLA will inevitably take military actions to start a just war to liberate Taiwan.The US now wants to shape the Taiwan Straits as the main front to prevent China's rise, because the Democratic Progress Party (DPP) authorities in Taiwan have completely turned to the US, and thus can be used as a tool. We must warn the DPP authorities not to wrongly believe that US support is safe for them to split China without being punished.PLA fighter jets recently crossed the so-called middle line of the Taiwan Straits on a large scale, clearly drawing the red line that the US and Taiwan must not further collude. The Global Times has understood that PLA fighter jets were as closest as only seconds away from the coast of Taiwan. They were only one step away from flying over the island of Taiwan.The Global Times has predicted several times that the PLA fighter jets will fly over the island of Taiwan. The mainland would like to warn the Taiwan authorities that if the US and Taiwan continue to collude, this scenario would be bound to take place. If the Taiwan authorities still believe that the US and Taiwan can adopt ""salami slicing"" by sending higher-level officials to visit each other, they are making a gamble that will be costly to both of them.As tensions in the Taiwan Straits spiral, the Taiwan authorities led by Tsai Ing-wen accused the mainland of intimidation, and Washington asserted that the mainland has resorted to high military pressure to unilaterally change the status quo. But the tense situation in the Taiwan Straits began with the Tsai authorities abandoning the 1992 Consensus. This completely breaks the political basis for cross-Straits communication. Meanwhile, the passage of the Taiwan Travel Act by the US breaks away from the US' one-China policy. Safeguarding its territorial integrity has become an urgent task for the Chinese mainland.When the Tsai authorities scrapped the 1992 Consensus, they ""supported democracy and freedom of Taiwan people."" When the US violated the three joint communiqués between China and the US to boost ""diplomatic"" ties with Taiwan and sell arms to Taiwan, it ""supported Taiwan's democratic regime."" But when the mainland sent its warning through military exercises, it ""exercised autocracy and power."" Such fallacies will not win support from international law and the international community.It is not known how the US and Taiwan will make further provocations, but the response of the mainland is certain. If the US and Taiwan raise the level of officials for engagement, the mainland will firmly respond by sending PLA fighter jets over the island of Taiwan to claim sovereignty. Deployment of the US army to Taiwan means the start of a cross-Straits war. With the Anti-Secession Law in place, Taiwan and the US should be prepared to confront the determination of the 1.4 billion mainland people and the PLA if they step over the red lines.The mainland has patiently promoted its policy for peaceful reunification for years. However, the Tsai authorities obstinately have walked toward the path of ""Taiwan independence"" and fallen prey to the US strategy of China containment, bringing the cross-Straits situation closer to a tipping point. If a cross-Straits war eventually breaks out, the Tsai authorities will be the collective sinners to be punished. "	9/24/20	0	0	0.0321	1

(eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Fu Gan) A marine assigned to a brigade of Marine Corps under the PLA Navy uses a device to monitor the meteorological conditions prior to a recent live-fire training exercise. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Shang Wenbin) Amid ongoing large-scale exercises by the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) in the Taiwan Straits targeting foreign interventions and Taiwan secessionists, an article recently published in a US military journal urged the US to consider returning US forces to the island, a move that would break the Three Joint Communiqués between China and the US that stipulated all US forces and military installations withdrawn from the Chinese island.This crazy suggestion does no good for people in Taiwan, and if it was to come true, the PLA would take resolute military action and realize reunification by force, Chinese mainland analysts said on Thursday, citing China's Anti-Secession Law.The two PLA aircraft carriers have recently completed regular exercises and sea trials respectively. Experts said the carriers could play vital roles in taking over the island.In an article titled ""Deterring the Dragon: Returning US Forces to Taiwan"" published in the September-October 2020 issue of the Military Review, the professional journal of the US Army, Captain Walker D. Mills of the US Marine Corps said that the US needs to consider basing ground forces in Taiwan as the balance of forces in East Asia continues to tip in favor of the PLA.Mills claimed that the presence of US ground forces could not only repel a PLA cross-Straits operation but also serve as a tripwire that would inevitably trigger a wider conflict not acceptable to the Chinese mainland.Another article in the journal said the US Army should provide a corps of two-to-four divisions plus supporting units to spearhead offensives against the PLA bridgeheads.If the US does deploy troops to Taiwan, it not only breaks the Three Joint Communiqués fundamental to China-US diplomatic relations, but also triggers articles in China's Anti-Secession Law and enables the state to employ non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, Chinese mainland analysts said.Despite that the US has been enhancing military cooperation with Taiwan island, including sending military consultants, the US military has remained cautious in stationing troops in the island, because it knows this kind of action will send China-US relations back to pre-1979 level, a status of confrontation, Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Thursday.The US would have to weigh and consider balance, Song said.The US must think twice and not challenge China's bottom line on its core interests such as the Taiwan question, Song said, noting that the PLA will not hesitate to fight, but to the US, Taiwan island is only a cash cow and pawn to pin down the Chinese mainland, and the US will abandon the island if it hurts US interests.China's Anti-Secession Law states that, in the event that ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist forces should act under any name or by any means to cause Taiwan's secession from China, or major incidents entailing Taiwan's secession from China should occur, or possibilities for a peaceful reunification be completely exhausted, the state shall employ non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.A potential US military deployment in Taiwan would fall into the second and third scenario that may trigger a PLA reunification-by-force operation, observers said.In such an event, the PLA would initiate operations using naval and air forces to lockdown the island of Taiwan, cut off its connection with the outside world and stop US forces from further intervening, a Beijing-based expert on military affairs told the Global Times on Thursday under the condition of anonymity.In a possible next step, the PLA could launch a full reunification-by-force operation, the anonymous expert said.The US Army journal article has also garnered heated discussion among politicians in Taiwan, with neither Democratic Progressive Party nor Kuomintang representatives believing it would be a good idea.Democratic Progressive Party ""legislator"" Lo Chih-Cheng said on Wednesday that US forces stationed in Taiwan would not necessary build up deterrence, and Kuomintang ""legislator"" Lee De-wei said while the US could continue arms sales to Taiwan, it is unlikely to send troops to the island, the Voice of America reported on Wednesday.The anonymous expert said that the PLA has built up strong deterrence with recent military exercises in the Taiwan Straits, and the Taiwan authorities currently do not want Washington to challenge Beijing to provoke a real cross-Straits military conflict, turning it into cannon fodder.The author of the article, a captain, is not a high-ranking officer, so it does not necessarily represent a strategic decision of the higher-ups in the US government and military. The US journal Military Review is US Army-affiliated, so it stresses the importance of ground forces, but it is questionable what role they could play compared to air and naval forces, which are more practical. Ground troops would only become meat shields and hostages, and the US would not risk this, the expert said.The ongoing live-fire exercises in the Taiwan Straits by the PLA demonstrate its determination and capability to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The drills are aimed at intervention from foreign forces, ""Taiwan independence"" secessionists and their secessionist actions, Senior Colonel Tan Kefei, a Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson, said at a regular press conference on Thursday.As part of the exercises, the PLA has flown dozens of warplanes including bombers, fighter jets and anti-submarine warfare aircraft near Taiwan island since Friday, according to the island's ""defense authority.""The two aircraft carriers from the PLA Navy, the Liaoning and the Shandong, have also recently completed regular exercises and sea trials respectively, Tan announced at the press conference.The exercises and trials by the two aircraft carriers sparked tensions on the island of Taiwan, as the military on the island feared a potential island encirclement patrol by the two carriers, Taiwan media reported earlier this month, when the two carriers embarked on voyages, with mainland experts saying the warships could play important roles in a potential reunification-by-force operation by attacking the island from different sides and intercepting a possible US intervention.Regardless of what action the US military takes, the PLA would maintain a strategic focus, which is to continue preparing with exercises aimed at the secessionists and foreign interventions, Song said, noting that the PLA should prepare for a worst-case scenario, in which the US and Japan both intervene.

Mills of the US Marine Corps said that the US needs to consider basing ground forces in Taiwan as the balance of forces in East Asia continues to tip in favor of the PLA.Mills claimed that the presence of US ground forces could not only repel a PLA cross-Straits operation but also serve as a tripwire that would inevitably trigger a wider conflict not acceptable to the Chinese mainland.Another article in the journal said the US Army should provide a corps of two-to-four divisions plus supporting units to spearhead offensives against the PLA bridgeheads.If the US does deploy troops to Taiwan, it not only breaks the Three Joint Communiqués fundamental to China-US diplomatic relations, but also triggers articles in China's Anti-Secession Law and enables the state to employ non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, Chinese mainland analysts said.Despite that the US has been enhancing military cooperation with Taiwan island, including sending military consultants, the US military has remained cautious in stationing troops in the island, because it knows this kind of action will send China-US relations back to pre-1979 level, a status of confrontation, Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Thursday.The US would have to weigh and consider balance, Song said.The US must think twice and not challenge China's bottom line on its core interests such as the Taiwan question, Song said, noting that the PLA will not hesitate to fight, but to the US, Taiwan island is only a cash cow and pawn to pin down the Chinese mainland, and the US will abandon the island if it hurts US interests.China's Anti-Secession Law states that, in the event that ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist forces should act under any name or by any means to cause Taiwan's secession from China, or major incidents entailing Taiwan's secession from China should occur, or possibilities for a peaceful reunification be completely exhausted, the state shall employ non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.A potential US military deployment in Taiwan would fall into the second and third scenario that may trigger a PLA reunification-by-force operation, observers said.In such an event, the PLA would initiate operations using naval and air forces to lockdown the island of Taiwan, cut off its connection with the outside world and stop US forces from further intervening, a Beijing-based expert on military affairs told the Global Times on Thursday under the condition of anonymity.In a possible next step, the PLA could launch a full reunification-by-force operation, the anonymous expert said.The US Army journal article has also garnered heated discussion among politicians in Taiwan, with neither Democratic Progressive Party nor Kuomintang representatives believing it would be a good idea.Democratic Progressive Party ""legislator"" Lo Chih-Cheng said on Wednesday that US forces stationed in Taiwan would not necessary build up deterrence, and Kuomintang ""legislator"" Lee De-wei said while the US could continue arms sales to Taiwan, it is unlikely to send troops to the island, the Voice of America reported on Wednesday.The anonymous expert said that the PLA has built up strong deterrence with recent military exercises in the Taiwan Straits, and the Taiwan authorities currently do not want Washington to challenge Beijing to provoke a real cross-Straits military conflict, turning it into cannon fodder.The author of the article, a captain, is not a high-ranking officer, so it does not necessarily represent a strategic decision of the higher-ups in the US government and military. The US journal Military Review is US Army-affiliated, so it stresses the importance of ground forces, but it is questionable what role they could play compared to air and naval forces, which are more practical. Ground troops would only become meat shields and hostages, and the US would not risk this, the expert said.The ongoing live-fire exercises in the Taiwan Straits by the PLA demonstrate its determination and capability to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The drills are aimed at intervention from foreign forces, ""Taiwan independence"" secessionists and their secessionist actions, Senior Colonel Tan Kefei, a Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson, said at a regular press conference on Thursday.As part of the exercises, the PLA has flown dozens of warplanes including bombers, fighter jets and anti-submarine warfare aircraft near Taiwan island since Friday, according to the island's ""defense authority.""The two aircraft carriers from the PLA Navy, the Liaoning and the Shandong, have also recently completed regular exercises and sea trials respectively, Tan announced at the press conference.The exercises and trials by the two aircraft carriers sparked tensions on the island of Taiwan, as the military on the island feared a potential island encirclement patrol by the two carriers, Taiwan media reported earlier this month, when the two carriers embarked on voyages, with mainland experts saying the warships could play important roles in a potential reunification-by-force operation by attacking the island from different sides and intercepting a possible US intervention.Regardless of what action the US military takes, the PLA would maintain a strategic focus, which is to continue preparing with exercises aimed at the secessionists and foreign interventions, Song said, noting that the PLA should prepare for a worst-case scenario, in which the US and Japan both intervene.

""As an air force, how can you let others strut at our own 'airspace？'"" said Tsai.Tsai's visit also comes amid an undesirable result from Taiwan's annual Han Kuang Exercise, five-day military drill seen as to test Taiwan's ability to resist a PLA attack. The result shows that Taiwan will be short of precision missiles in the war, and finally lose, Taiwan media reported.Analysts said Tsai's strong rhetoric reflects the weakness of the Taiwan authority, as Taiwan's military authority recently redefined the military rules of engagement from ""first strike"" to ""the right to self-defense and to counterattack,"" which means troops will only fire in a clear attack.The ""median line"" of the Taiwan Straits is the unilateral and shameless assumption from the separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities on the island, which is also a part of constructing Taiwan secessionism, Zhu Songling, a professor at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of Beijing Union University, said.Even Joseph Wu, head of Taiwan's ""foreign affairs authority,"" admitted on Tuesday that the ""median line"" was conceived by the authority on the island despite reacting against the mainland's comment on ""median line"", zaobao.com reported.The ""median line"" is just a ""hypothetical line of non-aggression"" drawn by the US during the Cold War. Taiwan authorities then signed the so-called ""US-Taiwan Defense Treaty."" The US military in 1954 required all Taiwan aircraft and ships to operate in the east of the ""median line;"" otherwise, they would not be guaranteed by the US military. Since then, Taiwan's air force has charted its own ""air defense identification zone"" with the ""median line.""The bogus ""median line"" is only a tacit understanding when cross-Straits relations were eased, and when Taiwan adhered to the one-China principle, Zhu said.The ""constitutions"" of both sides of the Straits support one China, and it is understandable for the PLA to fly over its own country and operate within its sovereign territory, Zhu said.The Chinese Navy's first Type 075 amphibious assault ship successfully completed its first sea trial, China's Ministry of National Defense announced in late August, saying the ship has strong capabilities in amphibious combat, and in carrying out a range of tasks.Wang Jianmin, a Taiwan-affairs expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that the Chinese mainland never recognizes the ""median line,"" which is an equivalent to a line that marks the division of a country.Amid rampant Taiwan secessionism, the mainland's reiteration of its stand on the ""median line"" is a declaration of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, said Wang Jianmin, noting the move is a deterrent to Taiwan's DPP authority.If the DPP continues to test the red line, military conflict cannot be ruled out, as the mainland will assert its sovereignty militarily, Wang said.Most Taiwan residents have never experienced the war and cannot understand its cruelty. The thought that ""the mainland would dare not achieve reunification by force"" will lead to disaster, Zhu said. "	9/23/20	0	0	-0.8794	-1

"China can powerfully counter US threats in first, second island chainsnPhoto: http://www.81.cn/ A viral video of an H-6K bomber released by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force on Saturday has made headlines in many Western media outlets. They allege that the video shows ""simulated attack on a US Air Force base on Guam."" This is over-interpretation. The video actually lucidly demonstrates China's capabilities to launch counterattacks. It is proof of the PLA's resolve to deal with any military provocation. The scene of exploration in it is designed for those who are up to something no good. When a certain country points a gun at China, sends aircraft to approach its territory, takes China as target of simulated attacks, and repeatedly provokes China, China will certainly respond with a display of what we are capable of. The video is merely an exhibition of China's counterbalance capabilities. It doesn't mean it is targeting certain troops. Nor will it initiate an attack against a certain position, or specifically deter a certain country. Nonetheless, if the US military sends bombers from its Pacific bases to deter China and bring direct threats, the PLA's H-6K bombers are indeed capable of launching effective counterattacks against these bases, frontier deployments, and forward bases. This is what the PLA Air Force's video wants to convey, in my take. Why have many Western media outlets speculated that the exploration scene in the video is at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam? The reason is simple: They need an imaginary target when they analyze the PLA Air Force's long-range strike capabilities. This is especially true of the operational range of H-6K bombers. Given the military games between China and the US at present, some media outlets, particularly Western ones, involuntarily believe Guam �?the hub of US military operations in the second island chain �?is the ideal reference for their evaluation. However, judging from the information released by the PLA, we can see it hasn't explicitly or apparently pointed to a certain country or target. China's military operations are defensive in nature. It only pursues defensive counterattack strategies. If China is not provoked or threatened, it will not engage in direct counterattack like what is showed in the video. But if anyone greatly endangers China's national defense security and strategic security, or even takes direct actions against the country, then its countermoves will definitely be extraordinarily fast - and in rapid real time. Currently, the US has repeatedly provoked China. Yet I don't think the US will dare open fire recklessly. Now, the two major powers are still at a stage of contests and games. The atmosphere is not tense enough to trigger direct conflicts, or even a war. China's H-6K bombers can further extend operational ranges. These aircraft can carry cruise missiles with ranges over 1,000 kilometers. This means they can strike precise targets in either the first or second island chains. To show China's capability of strategic counterbalance is, to some extent, a warning to other countries to not provoke at China's doorsteps. When it comes to the second island chain, the US takes an upper hand in terms of military strength. It can enhance its offense and defense abilities in the area with aircraft carrier strike groups, not to mention that the country possess bombers of world-leading quantity and quality. But despite a strong US military presence in this sphere, we must emphasize that China has enough counterbalance and counterattack measures to mitigate risks. Although China's overall naval and air forces strength still have a gap with those of the US, if Washington poses a direct threat to China's national defense security and strategic security from the military bases in the second island chain, China is fully capable of making them pay corresponding prices. In this sense, China may need to further strengthen its strategic power projection capabilities and combined naval and air force combat capabilities.

"PLA Eastern Theater Command disciplines soldier for leaking classified intelligencenSoldiers assigned to an army aviation brigade under the PLA 72nd Group Army queue to board a Mi-171 transport helicopter prior to a fast-roping training exercise on September 19, 2020. The aviation brigade and a combined arms unit jointly conduct training subjects including force projection, fast-roping and firepower striking, so as to beef up troops' cooperative engagement and multi-dimensional defense penetration capabilities. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Zhang Huanpeng) The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command, responsible for the Taiwan Straits and one of the most exercise-intensive PLA commands this year, has disciplined a soldier for leaking classified intelligence by mobile phone, the command recently revealed.The soldier, a private first class surnamed Chen, used to serve in an undisclosed coastal defense brigade under the PLA Eastern Theater Command Army. He bought a second-hand mobile phone without permission, and on several occasions during training and missions, used this unauthorized phone for discussing classified military information and sending photos involving military secrets via chat applications such as WeChat and QQ with family members and friends, and exposed his identity as a soldier in mobile phone games. These actions eventually led to the leaking of classified intelligence, media reported on Wednesday, citing a statement released by the Eastern Theater Command on Monday.In accordance with the PLA's disciplinary regulations, Chen has been demoted and made to retire from active service early, the statement said, noting that Chen's superiors were also disciplined. The main military and political officers at his company received executive warnings, and the squad leader was transferred from the post and received a disciplinary probation of three months.Soldiers and officers must have a strong sense of confidentiality, keep network security in mind and closely abide by related disciplinary regulations, the command said.Responsible for the Taiwan Straits, the PLA Eastern Theater Command has been one of the most exercise-intensive PLA commands this year. In addition to many regular and routine exercises, the command has been holding large-scale military drills in the Taiwan Straits, including a series of real combat-oriented exercises since Friday, which are targeting the current cross-Straits situation, according to Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang, spokesperson at the Ministry of National Defense.Global Times "	9/23/20	0	0	0.9601	1

"Update: HK murder suspect ready to surrender to Taiwan after COVID-19 travel restrictions liftednChan Tong-kai, a Hong Kong citizen accused of murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan in 2018, bows in front of the media as he leaves the city's Pik Uk Prison. Photo: VCG RELATED ARTICLES: DPP eyes political gains from murder case Peter Koon Ho-ming, provincial secretary general of the Anglican church in Hong Kong, said he was ready to fly to the island of Taiwan to push forward the surrender of a murder suspect, whose case promoted the extradition bill that sparked months of social unrest in Hong Kong last year.Koon told the Global Times on Tuesday that due to various reasons such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the surrender of Chan Tong-kai, the Hong Kong man who killed his girlfriend in Taipei and was released from prison last October for money laundering, had been suspended for some months, and Koon wanted to fly to Taiwan to discuss the upcoming procedures with Taiwan lawyers right after the travel restrictions between Taiwan and Hong Kong are lifted.Koon said he was refused to enter Taiwan last year, and was not sure whether he could get a visa even after the epidemic.Chan has been living in a police safe house since he was released, which showed his sincerity in surrendering himself, Koon said, noting that Chan's decision to live in the safe house was also out of possible concerns that Taiwan authorities may suspect him of fabricating evidence once he was out.Observers believed that in addition to the epidemic, the Taiwan authority has continued to delay Koon's visa for political reasons.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said at a press conference on Tuesday that the Hong Kong Special Administration Region (HKSAR) government is willing to offer assistance to bring about Chan's surrender.Lam said Chan is a free man under Hong Kong law and there is nothing more they can do under the current judicial system, while expressing sympathy and condolences to the parents of his victim Poon Hiu-wing.Lam said she learnt from Koon that Chan feels guilty and is willing to bear the legal responsibility.Only after Chan surrenders himself and accepts the punishment of the law can he really become a free man, Koon said.Chan, who was released from Hong Kong prison in late October 2019, apologized for killing his girlfriend and reiterated his willingness to go to Taiwan to surrender. Just before he was discharged, the Taiwan authorities, who had publicly refused to accept him, suddenly changed their stance and announced that they would send their law enforcement officers to the HKSAR to escort Chan to the island for trial.However, due to the political situation and the COVID-19 epidemic, the Taiwan authorities gave the cold shoulder to the Hong Kong government regarding communication in other aspects, said Lam, noting that the HKSAR government is willing to provide assistance after the communication between the two sides returns to normal.Chan killed his girlfriend Poon in Taipei in 2018 and escaped to Hong Kong, where he could not be charged with murder. As there is no extradition agreement between Hong Kong and Taiwan, Chan could not be sent back to Taiwan either.Chan's case led to a month of social unrest and violence in Hong Kong in 2019.

Photo: VCG RELATED ARTICLES: DPP eyes political gains from murder case Peter Koon Ho-ming, provincial secretary general of the Anglican church in Hong Kong, said he was ready to fly to the island of Taiwan to push forward the surrender of a murder suspect, whose case promoted the extradition bill that sparked months of social unrest in Hong Kong last year.Koon told the Global Times on Tuesday that due to various reasons such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the surrender of Chan Tong-kai, the Hong Kong man who killed his girlfriend in Taipei and was released from prison last October for money laundering, had been suspended for some months, and Koon wanted to fly to Taiwan to discuss the upcoming procedures with Taiwan lawyers right after the travel restrictions between Taiwan and Hong Kong are lifted.Koon said he was refused to enter Taiwan last year, and was not sure whether he could get a visa even after the epidemic.Chan has been living in a police safe house since he was released, which showed his sincerity in surrendering himself, Koon said, noting that Chan's decision to live in the safe house was also out of possible concerns that Taiwan authorities may suspect him of fabricating evidence once he was out.Observers believed that in addition to the epidemic, the Taiwan authority has continued to delay Koon's visa for political reasons.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said at a press conference on Tuesday that the Hong Kong Special Administration Region (HKSAR) government is willing to offer assistance to bring about Chan's surrender.Lam said Chan is a free man under Hong Kong law and there is nothing more they can do under the current judicial system, while expressing sympathy and condolences to the parents of his victim Poon Hiu-wing.Lam said she learnt from Koon that Chan feels guilty and is willing to bear the legal responsibility.Only after Chan surrenders himself and accepts the punishment of the law can he really become a free man, Koon said.Chan, who was released from Hong Kong prison in late October 2019, apologized for killing his girlfriend and reiterated his willingness to go to Taiwan to surrender. Just before he was discharged, the Taiwan authorities, who had publicly refused to accept him, suddenly changed their stance and announced that they would send their law enforcement officers to the HKSAR to escort Chan to the island for trial.However, due to the political situation and the COVID-19 epidemic, the Taiwan authorities gave the cold shoulder to the Hong Kong government regarding communication in other aspects, said Lam, noting that the HKSAR government is willing to provide assistance after the communication between the two sides returns to normal.Chan killed his girlfriend Poon in Taipei in 2018 and escaped to Hong Kong, where he could not be charged with murder. As there is no extradition agreement between Hong Kong and Taiwan, Chan could not be sent back to Taiwan either.Chan's case led to a month of social unrest and violence in Hong Kong in 2019.

"Taiwan agent banned from providing service for mainland streaming platform iQIYIniQIYI Photo: cnsphoto The Taiwan agent for the mainland's streaming platform iQIYI will cease providing customer service for the company starting from October 15. The move comes after the island's economic authorities recently launched a new rule aimed at preventing technology companies from the Chinese mainland carrying out so-called illegal operations in Taiwan without an official license - a groundless move considered by many to be an awkward imitation of the US' recent behavior of disrupting private companies by abusing governmental power.Against the backdrop of the new rule by the Taiwan economic authorities on September 3, OTT Entertainment, the Taiwan agent of iQIYI, will terminate the customer service provided by OTT Entertainment on October 15 at the request of the ""National Communications Commission,"" the company said in its official statement on Monday, noting that after that, iQIYI members should contact iQIYI online customer service for ordering or customer service.The agent had already ceased its iQIYI Taiwan member distribution business and abandoned its iQIYI brand agency service on the same day that the island's economic authorities launched the new rule forbidding local companies to act as an agent for or distribute internet audiovisual services to people or organizations on the mainland from September 3.OTT media services stream media directly to viewers via the internet, meaning it bypasses cable, broadcast, and satellite television platforms, and therefore any local controls too.The Chinese streaming platform iQIYI applied in 2016 to invest in the Taiwan region and set up a subsidiary, but its OTT-TV business belongs to a sector closed to mainland individuals and companies for investment. iQIYI's application was therefore not approved. iQIYI has since gained huge popularity in the region for its quality content, especially among young people.""We appreciated users and members for supporting iQIYI in the past four years, even though the corresponding service must be terminated by government decree related to agency business,"" the company said.Despite the customer service with iQIYI coming to an abrupt halt, the Taiwanese company noted that the iQIYI app can still be run in 60 countries and regions worldwide. Those users, including those in Taiwan, can continue to enjoy iQIYI.""Taiwan people enjoy mainland video programs, especially TV dramas, but cannot watch them through formal channels - only via OTT-TV,"" Xiang Ligang, an industry analyst, told the Global Times, noting that there are many similar Taiwanese businesses, all of whom entered the market through agents.After the customer service ends in mid-October, for iQIYI members to get customer service, they will need to contact iQIYI online customer service directly, OTT Entertainment said.

"PLA minesweepers to break Taiwan sea mines threatnThe guided-missile destroyers Hohhot (Hull 161) and Wuhan (Hull 169), together with the guided-missile frigate Hengyang (Hull 568), steam in formation in an undisclosed sea area during a 4-day maritime real-combat training exercise on September 2, 2020. All the warships are attached to a naval destroyer flotilla under the PLA Southern Theater Command. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Li Wei) Multiple minesweeper flotillas attached to the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Southern Theater Command and Eastern Theater Command recently held live-fire exercises, honing their capability to effectively and rapidly clear sea lanes from mines, and open passages for other warships and landing forces, amid Taiwan secessionists' attempt to surround the Taiwan Straits with mines.Although the reports didn't mention if the drills took place in the Taiwan Straits, the moves showed that the PLA has sufficient capability to thwart any attempt of deploying sea mines to obstruct the PLA's operations, and Taiwan's tactics of laying mines in the Taiwan Straits to buy time for US reinforcements will not succeed, Chinese mainland experts said on Monday.The anti-sea mine exercises come amid the PLA's drills in the Taiwan Straits aimed at Taiwan secessionists and the US, who have been ramping up tensions in the Taiwan Straits.An anti-sea mine flotilla consisting of the Liuyang, the Kaiping, and the Changshu affiliated with the PLA Southern Theater Command recently conducted a mine-sweeping exercise using live sea mines, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Sunday.The ships covered the calm sea, under which smart sea mines were hidden, as they would explode once they detect any sound or magnetic field change caused by ships passing by, the report said. Sonar systems and minesweeping robots were deployed to detect, identify and dismantle the mines, the report said.""In this exercise, we comprehensively tested the anti-sea mine ships' ability to react quickly, deal with complicated situations, and carry out anti-sea mine tasks by setting realistic combat scenarios, battlefield environment and difficult training subjects,"" He Jing, captain of the Liuyang, told CCTV.Another anti-sea mine flotilla involving the Rudong and the Jiangshan affiliated with the PLA Eastern Theater Command recently conducted comprehensive anti-sea mine training in the East China Sea, a separate CCTV report said last week.In addition to clearing different types of sea mines, including drifting and moored mines, the ships also conducted live-fire anti-aircraft exercises, the report said.Minesweepers can serve as trailblazers and provide safe passage for other ships, analysts said.Reuters reported last week that the US is pushing an arms sales surge to Taiwan, including smart, underwater sea mines. Taiwan has also been constructing mine-laying vessels, the first of which is expected to be delivered by the end of the year, reports said in August.Chinese mainland military experts reached by the Global Times said that by laying mines in the Taiwan Straits, the island is attempting to slow down a potential PLA amphibious landing on the island, as the island wrongly believes the PLA would need a long time to sweep the mines and not launch a full-scale amphibious assault before sea lanes are cleared. This way, it thinks it could buy enough time and wait for US reinforcements.The recent PLA drills showed that Taiwan's mine tactics will fail since the PLA has the ability to sweep sea mines and open passages very fast, experts said, noting that PLA troops can also carry out airborne landing operations, which will allow them to avoid the sea mines.The deployment of sea mines will only isolate the island from the rest of the world, but will not be able to stop a potential amphibious landing by the PLA, experts said.

"Tsai's secessionist activities threaten cross-Straits situationnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT Tsai Ing-wen, the island of Taiwan's regional leader, said on Sunday that the recent operations of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) fighter jets had made the threat from the Chinese mainland clear to others. This is simply nonsense.The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority, which has jeopardized the foundation of cross-Straits peace and stability with Washington's instigation, has been the real threat to the island of Taiwan.Since Tsai took office, she betrayed the 1992 Consensus and created a confrontation between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. Moreover, amid the US' escalating anti-China campaign, Washington and the DPP have further deepened their collusion.From approving the so-called Taiwan Travel Act in 2018, to consecutively sending high-level officials to visit the island, and increasingly upgrading arms sales to the island, the US, jointly with the island authorities, has stepped on the redline.The Chinese mainland makes no promise to renounce the use of force to address the Taiwan question. The PLA's recent operations are targeted at secessionist forces and their malicious attempts.Based on a political calculus, the DPP authority has chosen to act like self-important puppets with strings in foreign hands, and repeatedly misguides the Taiwan people's perception of cross-Straits ties, making Taiwan society hostile to the mainland. If this is not a threat to Taiwan, then what is?The DPP authority willingly acts as a card of the anti-China forces in the US to contain the Chinese mainland, colluding with them to push the island toward the abyss. They are the de facto threat. As the cross-Straits situation becomes more complicated, their attempts to sow discord and kidnap Taiwan society have further exposed their evil nature.The DPP authority is lost in the illusion of a so-called political breakthrough brought about by visits of US high-level officials. It blindly believes that they can get through the dead end of secession with Washington's help. If someone feels threatened, it only reveals they are deeply aware that they are violating the interests of people on both sides of the Straits.To maximize their political interests, the DPP authority and Washington have further colluded and imposed greater uncertainties in the Taiwan Straits. The Chinese mainland is willing to create vast room for peaceful reunification.However, such goodwill has been taken for granted that the mainland dare not really use force.But when the PLA showed its resolve, the secessionist forces have exposed their nature of cowardice, and immediately played victim trying to gain the sympathy of the international community.Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. The PLA's relevant exercises are necessary to maintain China's sovereignty and cross-Straits security. We love peace, but we are increasingly aware that peace is dependent on military strength, and the firm will to use them when necessary.The collusion between the US and the DPP authority is threatening the safety and welfare of all Taiwan people, as well as regional security.It has pushed the island to an impasse. The Tsai authority should either stop playing with fire before it is too late, or prepare for dire consequences. "	9/21/20	1	1	0.4678	1
"US arms sales won't alter power imbalance between mainland and TaiwannIllustration: Liu Rui/GT The administration of US President Donald Trump is pushing the sale of seven large packages of weapons to the island of Taiwan, according to The New York Times（NYT）. The NYT article further said that an air-to-ground missile, the AGM-84H/K SLAM-ER, is the most sensitive weapon system of the proposed packages. The missiles could hit targets on the Chinese mainland or at sea, including warships trying to cross the Taiwan Straits.In accordance with the three China-US joint communiqués, especially the August 17 Communiqué, the US government stated that it does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan. It further noted that its arms sales to Taiwan will not exceed, either in qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level of those supplied in recent years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the US and China in 1979. The Taiwan Relations Act that was enacted in 1979 also stipulates that the US shall provide Taiwan with arms that are only defensive in character.However, the air-to-ground missile included in the proposed packages of arms sales to Taiwan falls into the category of offensive weapons.As a matter of fact, Washington has violated the related rules and regulations enacted in its acts and communiqués regarding arms sales to the island of Taiwan for a long time. As early as in 1992, US F-16 warplanes, which the US sold to Taiwan, are also offensive weapons.What Beijing should consider now is how to counter the US. After all, Washington has repeatedly challenged the one-China principle and trampled the three China-US joint communiqués.Reuters said that pursuing seven sales at one time is rare. It breaks precedent with US military sales to the island. What are Washington's intensions?First, US arms dealers could earn a lot of money from such large-scale arms sales. Trump is certainly willing to do so. The arms business has always been one of the ways for the US to make money. They have sold a large amount of second-hand or non-advanced weapons and equipment to Taiwan. As such, US arms dealers can make huge profits from it.Second, the Trump administration as well as other politicians and lawmakers want to create a cross-Straits arms race to drain China's power.In addition, the US wants to intensify the cross-Straits tensions to prevent China from growing too fast. Arms sales to the island of Taiwan can certainly achieve that aim. This seriously harms China's development interests and security. It also seeks to contain China.Whereas the US continues to provoke China, this explicit deal may be approved. However, whatever the island of Taiwan buys, it will not be able to change the power imbalance between the mainland and Taiwan. The fact is that Taiwan's military capabilities are nowhere close to what the PLA can do. That is to say, one or two pieces of weapons can't change the power imbalance.With the US presidential election approaching, the Taiwan card has been played too far by Washington. Recently, a US under secretary of state visited Taiwan. The US ambassador to the United Nations met with representatives of the island too and supported its participation in UN affairs. Some lawmakers have even suggested that the US should restore ""diplomatic"" relations with Taiwan.Trump has frequently played the Taiwan card, trying to win his presidential election without any costs. It is very likely that Trump and his far-right populist constituency will pass on this proposal. Trump may, if reelected, consider establishing ""diplomatic"" relations with Taiwan. He may further promise to bring Taiwan into the international community. Even if Joe Biden is elected, the situation might be the same.In the face of this, China should not hold out hope for the US. China must maintain its strategic focus. Besides, China now needs to increase its military and economic strength. It must accumulate comprehensive national strength and be prepared for military conflicts. If the US arms sales to Taiwan are approved, the PLA and the Chinese government should impose sanctions on relevant US companies and normalize these sanctions. All US companies that violate the one-China principle should be blacklisted. This will be a deterrence for these US companies - not only companies that sell weapons, but also some affiliated companies.The author is a Chinese military expert and commentator. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	9/21/20	0	0	0.5454	1

"Taiwan's economy, trade break-off from mainland a dream: expertsnUS Undersecretary of State Keith Krach alights from an aircraft after landing at the Sungshan airport in Taipei on Thursday. Photo: AFP The Chinese foreign ministry said China will take legitimate countermeasures, including targeting individuals, after US Undersecretary of State Keith Krach ended his visit to the island of Taiwan, adding that the US must bear full responsibility for violating the one-China principle.Wang's remarks came after Krach left the island on Saturday with only an illusory promise to the island about an economic and business dialogue between the two sides.At a press briefing Sunday, Taiwan's economic affairs authority said they have reached a consensus on holding a dialogue, the agenda of which remains unsettled, as Taiwan will see ""if it is at the US' convenience.""Taiwan economic affairs authority head Wang Mei-hua said on Sunday that the island and the US delegation took the opportunity to exchange views on economic cooperation, including a 5G network, industrial supply chain restructuring, the Indo-Pacific strategy and energy issues.Krach began his visit to Taiwan on Thursday, after US Secretary of Health and Human Resources Alex Azar visited the island in August. He became one of the most senior US officials in decades after US cut diplomatic ties with the island in 1979, and promised to abide by the one-China principle.Although the visit was once again called a ""historic breakthrough"" by the incumbent pro-secessionism Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority, analysts believe that Krach's visit was a political bait for the DPP administration to continue to bet on the Trump administration in the face of pressure from the mainland, and Taiwan will get deeper into the trap of ""swapping economic chips for political chips.""Zhang Hua, an associate research fellow of the Institute of Taiwan Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday that Krach's visit was a ""reward"" for the DPP authority's efforts to lift restrictions on imported US ractopamine-enhanced pork, which angered the Taiwan people.Krach's visit only succeeded in provoking the mainland, Zhang said, noting that the DDP stands to lose rather than win from his visit.The dialogue between Krach and DPP authority highlights the DPP's attempt to decouple from the mainland, taking advantage of the confrontation between the mainland and the US to join the new industrial system that the US is trying to establish and exclude the mainland, Zhang said.Observers believe that after the political, social and cultural aspects, the DPP wants to cut off from the mainland economically, seeking a further break-off.The US wants Taiwan to be open to them in all areas, including high-tech and agricultural products. Once it opens up, the living space of the Taiwan market will be badly squeezed, so Taiwan will not make too many concessions, Lü Cuncheng, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times.As a result, the consensus of a dialogue is more like lip service, which at best will lead to a preliminary but not influential Free Trade Agreement, Lü said, noting such a bait would keep Taiwan politically dependent on the Trump administration.Taiwan's economic dependence on the Chinese mainland is growing, even if the DPP authority is reluctant to admit it publicly, Lü said. He added that the economies of the mainland and Taiwan are highly complementary, and geographic factors are impossible to get rid of, which the US cannot match.The Chinese mainland is Taiwan's largest export market, the largest source of Taiwan's trade surplus, and the largest region for Taiwan's investment. Taiwan's global exports grew at an annual rate of only 0.5% in the first half of 2020, while its exports to the mainland and Hong Kong grew at 9.8%, accounting for 42.3% of Taiwan's total exports, the Xinhua News Agency reported.Observers said the mainland quickly resumed production and work quickly amid the COVID-19 pandemic, becoming the backbone of the global supply chain recovery. The proportion of cross-Straits trade in Taiwan's overall trade is expected to continue to rise, proving that Taiwan's economy and trade will not be able to ""break off from the mainland.""Taiwan secessionism is a dead end, and connivance and support for it is doomed to fail. Any act that undermines China's core interests and interferes in China's internal affairs will be vigorously countered by China, foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Monday, adding no force can hold back the historical tide of China's reunification.We urge the US to correct its mistakes, stop all official and military contacts with Taiwan, and stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and stop words and deeds that undermine China-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, Wang said.

China's top political advisor Wang Yang addressed the forum via video link on Sunday. Photo: csnphoto The ongoing Straits Forum held in the Chinese mainland for cross-Straits people-to-people exchanges showed that the mainland is handling the complicated situation with ""two hands"" - supporting exchanges and cooperation to serve the concrete benefits of Taiwan compatriots, and increasing military pressure to deter Taiwan separatism and the Trump administration which is increasingly throwing its weight on the Taiwan question, experts said on Sunday.""Taiwan secession is a dead end,"" China's top political advisor Wang Yang said via video at the Straits Forum held by the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council in Xiamen, Fujian Province on Sunday, the Xinhua News Agency reported. Wang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, added that asking for support from foreign forces to make dangerous moves will only bring unbearable risk to Taiwan.From Friday to Saturday, according to Taiwan media, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has sent dozens of military aircraft including bombers and fighter jets to cross the so-called ""middle line"" of the Taiwan Straits, and on Sunday, military aircraft from the PLA, Taiwan military and the US military all appeared in the morning in the southwest ""airspace"" of the island.Wang remarked that since the beginning of this year, the global economic situation is becoming more severe, but trade between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits is still increasing sharply, and this has proved that the mainland is always the most reliable and solid backer for the island.According to data released by the Ministry of Commerce on September 11, from January to August this year, trade between the mainland and island of Taiwan reached more than $158.9 billion, a year-on-year growth of 10 percent.""Some people in the island are trying to limit and decrease cross-Straits exchanges and cooperation, and vainly attempt to decouple from the mainland's economy and cut-off cultural connection. These will bring no gains but all losses to Taiwan,"" Wang stressed.Zheng Bo-yu, manager of the Vstartup Station of Taiwan and a Taiwan youth representative who attended multiple parallel sessions of the ongoing forum, told the Global Times that the forum is a platform for people-to-people exchanges, for the Taiwan youth who want to launch startups or study in the mainland, rather than a political forum, so the rising tensions around Taiwan Straits at present did not affect the atmosphere of the forum too much.""But unfortunately, due to the interruption made by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority, only some people could fly to Xiamen, and an online parallel session on cultural issues which was scheduled to be held in Taipei had to be canceled,"" he said.""We [Taiwan participants] are joking with our mainland partners at the forum, saying that if you can see anyone from Taiwan participating in the forum this time, they are all coming with true love,"" Zheng said. He said that some of them might be targets of the DPP authority after they return to Taiwan as the separatist authority does not want to see the friendly exchanges aiming at promoting mutual understanding with the mainland.Lee Sheng-feng, vice president of the New Party of Taiwan, a Taiwan political party with a pro-reunification stance, told media at the forum on Sunday that ""the whole society of Taiwan has a consensus - peace. The exchange is a foundation for the two sides to reach that peace, and whoever is interrupting the exchanges is the one who is undermining the peace, and is a sinner to history and the people on the two sides of the Straits.""Despite obstacles set by DPP authorities, some 2,000 participants from the island attended the forum, according to Xinhua on Saturday.Roughly at the same time, US Undersecretary of State Keith Krach visited the island of Taiwan to increase interactions with the separatist DPP authority, but Taiwan participants in the Straits Forum said that this kind of interaction is all about politics and only benefits the Trump administration and the separatist authority. It has nothing to do with Taiwan people's interests.Originally, the DPP authority said Krach would hold an economic dialogue with DPP authority but it turned out that this was only a wishful thinking, and the Trump administration wants to show its support for Taiwan separatism to provoke the mainland. It wants to force the island to buy more US problematic products and weapons and the DPP can still please the separatists in the island to win more support.""It is hilarious and ridiculous that the DPP is making Taiwan residents happy to be a cash-machine for the US, while gaining no promise of security and economic interests from Washington,"" Zheng said. ""At the same time, they can also make many Taiwan people blindly hate the mainland, which is the one providing significant economic opportunities and benefits to the island.""Wu Cherng-dean, president of the New Party, who also attended the forum, told the Global Times on Sunday that the current tensions are getting more serious than the 1996 Taiwan Straits Crisis.""At that time, the interference of the US was more symbolic, but now it seems like the US could even make significant policy shift on the Taiwan question,"" Wu said."" This could mean an abandonment of their previous stance and the one-China principle to openly support separatism, Wu noted.The recent massive military drills conducted by the PLA show that the Chinese mainland is capable of seizing air superiority and command of the sea over the island of Taiwan and in the Straits if the mainland has to reunify the island by force due to the uncontrolled extreme secessionism of the island, said military experts.Some politicians within the island are trying to blame the mainland for the rising tensions, and these politicians are not only from the ruling DPP, but also from the opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), which canceled its delegation to the forum in Xiamen. On Saturday, Chiang Chi-chen, president of the KMT posted on Facebook that the actions of the PLA will make public opinion in the island less favorable to the mainland.However, this kind of opinion is truly unfair and confuses right and wrong, said Chinese mainland analysts, because these actions are actually triggered by increasing collusion between Washington and the island, which are intended to provoke the mainland and encourage separatism.""When the mainland said it will not forego the use of force to reunify the island, it is speaking to the separatists rather than Taiwan people, and now the recent warnings and deterrence released by mainland officials and the military is to let Taiwan people understand it is the DPP and the US who are endangering them, rather than the mainland,"" said a Beijing-based expert on Taiwan affairs on Sunday.The expert told the Global Times that ""unfortunately, although the mainland has made a lot of effort to provide convenience and support to serve the benefits of the people, due to the one-sided anti-mainland propaganda made by the DPP, many Taiwan residents' view on the mainland is getting worse rather than improving. This is making many mainland people lose faith on the prospect of peaceful reunification and they increasingly support a military solution.""""As Taiwan residents, we worry that the DPP's propaganda can use the tensions to legitimize arms sales from the US, which costs huge amounts of money and further endangers the island,"" Zheng said.

"PLA warplanes featured in drills in Taiwan Straits ‘capable of seizing air superiority and command of sea’nA fighter jet attached to an aviation regiment under the PLA Air Force soars into the air during a night flight training exercise in late June, 2020. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Tang Huaihui) In two consecutive days of military drills in the Taiwan Straits on Friday and Saturday, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) reportedly conducted nearly 40 sorties featuring four major types of warplanes - air superiority fighters, multirole fighters, bombers and an anti-submarine warfare aircraft, which Chinese mainland analysts said on Sunday are capable of seizing air superiority and command of the sea over the island of Taiwan and in the Straits.Two H-6 bombers, eight J-16 fighters, four J-10 fighters and four J-11 fighters on Friday, and 12 J-16 fighters, two J-10 fighters, two J-11 fighters, two H-6 bombers and one Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft on Saturday crossed the ""middle line"" of the Taiwan Straits, according to two press releases by Taiwan's defense authority on Friday and Saturday.Media on the island reported that the PLA continued its sorties in the Taiwan Straits on Sunday, but the island's defense authority reportedly claimed ""no anomaly was noticed.""Chinese mainland military analysts pointed out that the warplane combination the PLA deployed in the exercises is very accurate to a real combat situation and covers many different scenarios.J-10 and J-11 fighters are mainly used in combat against hostile aircraft, H-6 bombers are mainly used to attack warships and ground facilities, J-16 fighters are multirole and can tackle all aerial, maritime and land targets, and the Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft can locate and attack enemy submarines, a mainland military expert who asked for anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday.According to Taiwan's defense authority, PLA air superiority fighters, namely the J-10s and J-11s, operated to the northwest of the island close to Hsinchu and Taichung, where the island's Mirage 2000 and F-CK-1 fighters are based. The simulated missions by the J-10s and J-11s were probably aimed at neutralizing any remaining Taiwan warplanes there that had made their way into the air after surviving potential PLA missile and artillery strikes on Taiwan military airfields, analysts said.Several J-16 fighters, probably equipped with not only air-to-air missiles, but also anti-ship missiles and ground attack weapons, reportedly operated to the north of the island, near Taipei, Keelung and Yilan, where the political center and some of the naval bases of the Taiwan island are located.The other J-16s found themselves to the southwest of the island, near the H-6 bombers and the Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft. Analysts expect the J-16s to deal with Taiwan F-16 and F-CK-1 fighters based in Chiayi and Tainan, while also escort and cooperate with the H-6s in eliminating Taiwan warships based in Penghu and Kaohsiung with anti-ship missiles if necessary.Taiwan has fewer than 30 main battle surface combatants, and the two H-6 bombers each carrying four YJ-12 anti-ship missiles plus the eight to 12 J-16s each carrying two to four YJ-83 anti-ship missiles in addition to air combat armaments can prove to be devastating to the island's naval force, the anonymous expert said.The Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft could clear the Straits of submarines and, together with PLA minesweeping vessels, it could pave paths for the PLA landing forces, analysts said.Starting Friday, the PLA Eastern Theater Command is conducting real combat-oriented exercises near the Taiwan Straits, Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang, a spokesperson at the Ministry of National Defense, told the Global Times at a press conference on Friday.The move, which targets the current cross-Straits situation, is a legitimate and necessary action the mainland has taken to protect its sovereignty and integrity, Ren said.The PLA's live-fire exercises came when US Undersecretary of State Keith Krach is paying a visit to Taiwan island. Recently, the US has ramped up efforts in playing the Taiwan card and escalated provocations on military and diplomacy.Analysts said the PLA drills this time are not a warning, but a rehearsal for a Taiwan takeover.

"Beijing ‘composed’ over Japan-US alliancenYoshihide Suga (center) is inaugurated Japan's 99th Prime Minister on Wednesday. Photo: AFP Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga talked with US President Donald Trump on Sunday night via phone, and stated the Japan-US alliance remains the cornerstone of Tokyo's foreign policy. But Japan will also try to retain stable relations with China to gain the maximum interest for its own development, and China just needs to closely monitor the situation with strategic composure, Chinese analysts said.Suga and Trump affirmed the importance of the alliance between the two countries and agreed to coordinate on issues including the fight against COVID-19, Kyodo reported.Given that Japan's security and crucial auto industry are highly dependent on the US, the major trend of the Japan-US alliance and close bilateral ties will remain the same, Chinese analysts said.New Japanese prime ministers usually visit the US soon after they take office, but the pandemic may force Suga and Trump to communicate via phone.Analysts also noted that Japan does not want to inflame the situation in East Asia, which will harm its own interests — meaning the Suga government is unwilling to contain China as the US expects, or stir up trouble in the Taiwan Straits, where China and the US are having a fierce confrontation.After the change in Japanese political circles, former Japanese prime minister Yoshiro Mori made a visit to the island of Taiwan. Kyodo News Agency reported that Mori met with the regional leader of the island Tsai Ing-wen and told Tsai that the Japanese leader wants to have a phone call with her.China contacted Japan to clarify the report and Japan replied that such a call would absolutely not happen, China's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.Liu Junhong, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations in Beijing who specializes in Japan-related issues, told the Global Times on Sunday that Japan does not want a long-lasting standoff or out-of-control friction in the Taiwan Straits.""Japan wants to show its presence in the region and if the China-US confrontation continues, it may serve as a mediator,"" Liu said.Tsai also denied on Sunday that the island and Japan discussed the issue and said that the two sides had no plan for a phone conversation.In this sensitive situation, any provocative move should be avoided, analysts said, noting that Taiwan should not regard Mori's visit to the island, without an official role, as ""a form of support.""Analysts predicted when Suga was voted the prime minister, setbacks may occur in China-Japan relations as there are unsettled problems, such as historical issues and territorial disputes.Shinzo Abe, who just stepped down as Japan's prime minister last Wednesday, visited the Yasukuni Shirne on Saturday, triggering a flood of criticism on Chinese social media. The last time Abe visited the shrine was December 2013.It is believed that Abe avoided visiting the shine during his recent years in office in order not to aggravate China or South Korea. ""Abe's latest visit is a make-up for his past shunning of the site and a gesture to satisfy domestic right-wing forces. He also wanted to emphasize his political ethos and stance,"" Zhou Yongsheng, a professor of China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.Zhou said Abe's visit to the shrine could be a hint to the incoming Suga, suggesting that he shouldn't visit the shrine while in the post of prime minister. As a prestigious politician with huge influence, his visit could have a far-reaching impact on Japan's future leaders and politicians, soft in tactics but hard-line instance, Zhou said.

A Type 750 multifunctional vessel will conduct daily test firing in the sea from September 21 to October 1, according to the maritime administration’s announcement.The administration released coordinates of the areas involved and banned types of ships and all non-related personnel from entering the designated areas.Chinese military experts said the moves are aimed at warning the US not to further escalate the situation between the Taiwan Straits.Krach, the most senior US State Department official to visit Taiwan island since 1979, arrived in Taipei Thursday afternoon. He is reportedly in Taiwan for a memorial service on Saturday for the island's former leader Lee Teng-hui, who is considered by Chinese mainlanders as the ""godfather of Taiwan separatism.""

On Monday, the US is expected to start the Valiant Shield 2020 exercises on Guam and around the Mariana Islands Range Complex.The PLA has conducted more than 30 maritime drills in all four of its major sea regions, namely the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea and South China Sea, experts said.The frequent drills over the last two months indicate the PLA is ready to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, deter US interference and Taiwan secessionist forces, and, if they go too far, reunify the island by force.Experts noted that China’s aircraft carriers Liaoning and Shandong are ready for combat if war breaks out across the Taiwan Strait.A year after being commissioned, the Shandong carrier has achieved basic combat capacity and the Liaoning’s combat capacity is continuously growing, said Li Jie.

"Anti-China forces attempt to disrupt flight from China to Solomon Islands to prevent new Chinese ambassador from taking officenA boy watches a distant cargo ship in Honiara, Solomon Islands, Oct. 13, 2019. Photo:Xinhua RELATED ARTICLES: China slams US hype of botched deal in Solomon Islands Some people in Malaita, the Solomon Islands' most populous province that has been frequently seen playing tricks in attempts to damage the relationship between China and the Solomon Islands, recently clamored to call off a flight returning from China that was reportedly carrying Chinese officials including Li Ming, the new Chinese ambassador to the Solomon Islands.China's Pacific island regional experts condemned the clamor as a malicious obstruction of resumed Sino-Solomon Island ties, saying it was an effort by US-influenced forces to achieve an anti-China political conspiracy.""They were deliberately disrupting the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries if they knew Ambassador Li was on the flight,"" commented Yu Lei, chief research fellow at the research center for Pacific island countries of Liaocheng University in East China's Shandong Province.ABC reported on September 3 that new Chinese Ambassador Li was on the flight. The flight had landed at capital Honiara on September 2 local time, a Chinese passenger on the flight told the Global Times on Friday.The chartered Solomon Airlines flight, taking off from Honiara in the morning of September 1 to Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong Province, via Indonesia and then flying back following the same route, carried 104 passengers among whom 21 were Solomon Islands nationals, Solomon Airlines said on its website.It was the first flight between China and the Solomon Islands since the COVID-19 outbreak, some passengers said. There won't be more flights in the near future amid the pandemic, they told the Global Times.The rest of the passengers were Chinese nationals, according to a Radio New Zealand report on September 1.Most of the Chinese passengers included staffers of the Chinese Embassy in the Solomon Islands, as well as surveying and mapping personnel for the construction of the main stadium for the 2023 Pacific Games in Honiara, said passenger Li Lin. The project is one of the first involving assistance from China in the Solomon Islands since the two countries forged diplomatic ties last year.Contrary to the so-called health concern of some Malaita people saying the flight could bring the Solomon Islands COVID-19 patients and devastate the local healthcare system, all the passengers were found healthy before taking this flight through repeated COVID-19 tests, said the Solomon Islands National Disaster Council (NDC).""All [test] results turned out negative, which gave the greenlight to board the special flight,"" read a NDC statement on September 3.Li, a Chinese employee at a mining company in Solomon Islands, said he and other passengers on this flight had strictly followed the country's virus-preventing rules during and after the trip.""We had had three nucleic acid tests before boarding, and we kept wearingN95 masks during the whole flight,"" Li told the Global Times Friday, adding that the plane was thoroughly disinfected before taking off.All the passengers went into a 14-day quarantine at designated local hotels after the plane arrived at Honiara, Li said. During the quarantine, they received another three nucleic acid tests and had their body temperature checked every day by Solomon health officials, he added.Li returned home for vacation in January, when the unexpected COVID-19 outbreak hadn't taken place. ""[Through so many tests] we are confident about our health, and we can reassure every one [in the Solomon Islands],"" he said.The passengers including Li were in compliance with both China's and Solomon's COVID-19 prevention regulations, and their boarding met the WHO requirements, said Yu Lei, chief research fellow at the research center for Pacific island countries of Liaocheng University in East China's Shandong Province.""Obviously, the Malaita protestors stirred up trouble in this flight not for the concerns about the health of local citizens, but for their goal of destroying the Sino-Solomon relationship through smearing [the epidemic situation in China],"" Yu told the Global Times Friday.These protestors had been buzzing about the Guangzhou-Honiara flight for weeks, said a Chinese resident surnamed Wang, who stayed on in the Solomon Islands amid the pandemic. ""They disagreed on any flights [from China to enter], saying they're afraid of the virus being brought in,"" Wang told the Global Times Friday.Having long been influenced by Western forces including the US and Australia, Malaita is infamous for its pro-Taiwan stance, observers say. Last year, the province reportedly protested against Solomon national government's cutting ""diplomatic ties"" with the island of Taiwan and acknowledging the one-China principle.Daniel Suidani, premier of Malaita, announced an independence referendum for Malaita earlier this month, CNN reported on Friday.Many Chinese residents in the Solomon Islands shrug off the ""referendum,"" with some reached by the Global Times saying that they've got bored with the farces like this that have frequently happened in Malaita.""Malaita's economy is very bad, but people there seem immersed in creating protests and chaos about little things rather than getting down to [improve their economy],"" Wang commented, adding that the overwhelming majority of their protests have come to nothing.Solomon Islands established formal diplomatic relations with Chinese mainland in September 2019. The history will tell the fundamental and long-term interests of this decision to the people of the Solomon Islands, noted Chinese Sate Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi at the ceremony of the formal establishment of bilateral relations in Beijing.Several cooperative projects, including the construction of a reinforced concrete bridge near Honiara, have reportedly been launched in the Solomon Islands since the establishment of Sino-Solomon diplomatic relations, bringing jobs and convenience for local people.As a lesser developed country, the Solomon Islands had been politically and economically dependent on the West for decades, Yu said. It is now eager to achieve a true national independence and prosperity for people through cooperating with emerging Asian economies including China, he said.The Sino-Solomon relationship is a politically equal and economically win-win one, which is and will keep benefiting the people of both countries, Yu told the Global Times. ""Any intrigues trying to ruin this relationship are doomed to failure,"" he said. "	9/18/20	0	0	-0.9828	-1
"PLA Friday drills not warning, but rehearsal for Taiwan takeover: Global Times editorialnFile Photo:China Military The Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is conducting a real-combat military exercise near the Taiwan Straits starting Friday. Taiwan media reported that starting 7:16 am, aircraft of the PLA were approaching Taiwan island from four directions: the southwest, west, northwest and north of the island. Taiwan reportedly made 22 broadcasts to ""dispel"" the PLA aircraft, and the island used ""airspace"" instead of ""air zone"" or ""air defense identification zone"" in its broadcasts. The ""Taiwan defense department"" said 18 Chinese aircraft appeared in the Taiwan Straits, with some crossing the ""middle-line.""From our point of view, the PLA is still restrained. Every time a high-ranking US official visits Taiwan, the fighter jets of the PLA should be one step closer to the island. If the US secretary of state or secretary of defense comes to Taiwan, the PLA should fly its aircraft over the island and conduct exercises above it. The missiles we test should also fly over Taiwan, even its ""Presidential Office Building."" If Taiwan authorities continue to act aggressively, such scenarios will definitely come true.The military exercise sent two prominent signals. First, China's Ministry of National Defense spokesperson made it clear that the exercise is aimed at the current situation in the Taiwan Straits, which refers to the frequent collusion between the US and the island of Taiwan, the visit of US Undersecretary of State Keith Krach to Taiwan in particular. This indicates that the PLA won't be restrained in words anymore. Our target of deterrence is collusion between the US and the island.

Krach arrived in Taiwan Thursday. There was no announcement on the military exercise of the PLA in advance. It's more likely the exercise was a last-minute decision.That a massive action can be organized in such a short time sends a strong signal. It shows that the PLA has the ability to mobilize and organize a military action targeted at Taiwan in a very short period of time. Although it's called a military exercise, it's more like an actual combat. It's an emergency response by the PLA and the country to the situation in the Taiwan Straits, which is of great significance, adding the weight of the mainland in dealing with the cross-Straits situation.Through this exercise and the previous series of exercises, the PLA has accumulated experience in attacking Taiwan and mastered key data on Taiwan's defense system. They are rehearsals on taking over Taiwan. What is needed is a political reason that can turn them into real battle to smash Taiwan independence forces.The collusion between the US and Taiwan island is becoming the most prominent source of turbulence in the Taiwan Straits. The PLA military exercise this time further focused on deterrence and a strike. If the US and Taiwan island think they can realize ""normalization"" of relations by adopting ""salami tactics,"" they will be plunged into peril and risks. The mainland is determined to take all necessary means, including military options, to prevent the US and the island from upgrading their provocations.The PLA has lifted the curtain on real-combat military exercises targeted at Taiwan, and the scale of such exercises is bound to expand in the future and meet the requirements for substantive strikes against Taiwan. In fact, the Friday exercise is a landmark in the struggle across the Taiwan Straits.The US and Taiwan must not misjudge the situation, or believe the exercise is a bluff. Should they continue to make provocations, a war will inevitably break out. Those who have underestimated China's determination recently have all paid the price. China decisively put forward the implementation of the national security law for Hong Kong. China has shown that it doesn't fear war on the China-India border. The Taiwan Straits is by no means a place where separatists can act recklessly. If Taiwan authorities try, they will definitely be met with the mainland's military solutions.Taiwan is a small place. It has no conditions for a modern military confrontation. Taiwan independence is a dead end. "	9/18/20	0	0	0.7184	1
"PLA Friday drills not warning, but rehearsal for Taiwan takeover: Global Times editorialnFile Photo:China Military The Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is conducting a real-combat military exercise near the Taiwan Straits starting Friday. Taiwan media reported that starting 7:16 am, aircraft of the PLA were approaching Taiwan island from four directions: the southwest, west, northwest and north of the island. Taiwan reportedly made 22 broadcasts to ""dispel"" the PLA aircraft, and the island used ""airspace"" instead of ""air zone"" or ""air defense identification zone"" in its broadcasts. The ""Taiwan defense department"" said 18 Chinese aircraft appeared in the Taiwan Straits, with some crossing the ""middle-line.""From our point of view, the PLA is still restrained. Every time a high-ranking US official visits Taiwan, the fighter jets of the PLA should be one step closer to the island. If the US secretary of state or secretary of defense comes to Taiwan, the PLA should fly its aircraft over the island and conduct exercises above it. The missiles we test should also fly over Taiwan, even its ""Presidential Office Building."" If Taiwan authorities continue to act aggressively, such scenarios will definitely come true.The military exercise sent two prominent signals. First, China's Ministry of National Defense spokesperson made it clear that the exercise is aimed at the current situation in the Taiwan Straits, which refers to the frequent collusion between the US and the island of Taiwan, the visit of US Undersecretary of State Keith Krach to Taiwan in particular.

"Taiwan's hopes for US visit 'wishful thinking', to get nothingnUS Undersecretary of State Keith Krach alights from an aircraft after landing at the Sungshan airport in Taipei on Thursday. Photo: AFP US Undersecretary of State Keith Krach's visit to Taiwan can infuriate the Chinese mainland, and he avoided touching on the trade and investment agreement with the island, which can benefit the people of the island, said experts, noting that the US is just making use of rather than helping Taiwan.The US also let its ambassador to the UN meet with Taiwan's economic and cultural representative in New York.Chinese mainland experts warned that the Trump administration is shaking the political foundations of the China-US relations.China will make a ""necessary response"" to a visit by Krach to the island of Taiwan, and China urges the US to stop all forms of official exchanges with the island, Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said on Thursday, ahead of Krach's arrival.At the routine press conference on Thursday, Wang said that since the US insists on sending Krach to the island of Taiwan, Washington has seriously violated the three joint communiqués between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America, and encouraged Taiwan separatism, and damaged China-US relations and the stability of the Taiwan Straits.""China expressed firm opposition to this and has made solemn representations to the US,"" he noted.Krach, the most senior US State Department official to visit the island since 1979, arrived in Taipei on Thursday afternoon, according to the Taiwan media focustaiwan.tw.He is in Taiwan for a memorial service on Saturday for the island's former regional leader Lee Teng-hui, who is considered the ""godfather of Taiwan separatism,"" with most Chinese people worldwide considering him a traitor of the Chinese nation.Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday that sending such a senior official to Lee's memorial service is delivering a clear message - that of US support and encouragement of Lee's ideology, namely the Taiwan separatism.This is truly dangerous, Li said, because the Trump administration has violated the promise made by the US government when it established diplomatic ties with China in the late 1970s, and has shaken the political foundations of the bilateral relations.In the December 1978 joint communiqué with China, the US said ""the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal Government of China,"" and ""The Government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China, and Taiwan is part of China.""Taiwan media reported that Krach could also attend an ""economic talk,"" and will focus on the implementation of Taiwan's import of problematic US agriculture products, such as pork containing the additive ractopamine. But eventually, according to the US State Department on Wednesday, Krach will not attend the economic talk.Before the formal announcement by the US, the island's pro-separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority leaked the possible schedule to the media to give itself more diplomatic credit. This shows the DPP authority's wishful thinking to Washington. But the Trump administration just wants to use it to provoke the Chinese mainland, but is unwilling to offer anything more, such as discussing the possibility of signing a trade and investment agreement with the island, Chinese mainland experts said.Chang Ya-chung, a Taipei-based professor at National Taiwan University, told the Global Times previously when Lee died on July 30, ""The DPP authority will make full use of his death to gain more international support for its separatist cause.""Washington wants to use Krach's visit to send a clear signal to Beijing - ""The island of Taiwan must 100 percent obey the US,"" and further worsening cross-Straits relations is the priority of Krach's visit, rather than economic or trade issues, Chang said on Thursday.The US is using the Lee event to infuriate the Chinese mainland, and avoid talking about economic and trade issues that the residents of the island care about, Chang noted.The US is also trying to provoke China at the UN on the Taiwan question. ABC News reported on Thursday that US Ambassador to the UN Kelly Craft had lunch on Wednesday with James K.J. Lee, director of the Taipei economic and cultural office in New York.A meeting she called ""historic"" and a further step in the Trump administration's campaign to strengthen relations with the island, Craft said she and Lee ""discussed different ways that we can best help Taiwan become more engaged within the UN.""Yuan Zheng, a senior fellow at the Institute of American Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday the US knows it is impossible for the US to bring Taiwan into the UN as a formal member, because China is the permanent member of the UN Security Council which can veto such a proposal, and the move will be regarded as a declaration of cutting off diplomatic ties with China, and might lead to a war. But it seems the US is trying to use such tricks to further infuriate the Chinese mainland instead of really helping the island of Taiwan.""The Chinese mainland should send a clearer and more powerful warning to the US to let it know how serious the consequences would be,"" Yuan said.Li Haidong said if the US wants to support Taiwan to become a UN member, then Article 8 of the Anti-Secession Law of China will be activated, which means China shall use non-peaceful and other necessary means to solve the Taiwan question once and for all.The China-US relations in 2020 are facing an unprecedented challenge, as Washington is giving up its announced neutrality on the Taiwan question, and openly provoking China's sovereignty. Some Chinese mainland scholars had suggested that the Chinese government remain patient and restrained, as any reaction could be used by the Trump administration to gain greater domestic support for his reelection in November. They suggested that China not be used by the Trump administration.A Beijing-based expert on Taiwan affairs who requested anonymity told the Global Times that the US and the DPP authority believe that the Chinese mainland is facing a dilemma, because military retaliation could escalate tensions, and economic sanctions might harm the innocent people of the island and impact regional economic recovery, which is the priority in the post-pandemic era.""So the US and the Taiwan separatist authority are challenging and provoking the mainland again and again. But they have underestimated the mainland's capability and wisdom,"" he said.Taiwan media reported on Thursday that two Chinese mainland anti-submarine aircraft flew into ""Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ)"" on Wednesday, according to the island's ""defense authority.""""Some Taiwan-based experts said the PLA could engage in small-scale military actions, such as striking Taiwan targets with short- or medium-range missiles, and then the fragile economy of the island, which heavily relies on the mainland market, will soon collapse. This is a reasonable speculation to some extent,"" he noted. "	9/18/20	0	0	0.9738	1
"Vystrcil's clarification overdue to dispel anxiety of Czech firms in ChinanIllustration: Tang Tengfei/GT In response to a question about a Chinese importer's cancelation of a Czech piano order after Czech Senate Speaker Milos Vystrcil's Taiwan visit, the mainland's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson on Wednesday noted that the visit has ""hurt the feelings of the Chinese people.""In the question, the foreign reporter mentioned that some Western countries view the cancellation as a retaliation measure. Obviously, while China is maintaining quite restraint, concerns over the aftershocks from the Czech politician's provocation to business activities between the two countries linger on.When China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism issued a travel warning on Chinese people traveling to the Czech Republic a week ago, even though the warning is about Czech's surging COVID-19 cases, it's also widely seen as a form of punishment for Vystrcil's visit.A quick scan of the foreign media's recent reports about Vystrcil's Taiwan visit gives an impression that it seems like a sanction from China is awaited, and the reason is quite clear: a politician from a country that had established diplomatic relations with China has blatantly violated the one-China principle. Vystrcil had crossed a red line.The Czech government is trying to make up for the damage to China-Czech relations caused by the bad influence of the anti-China action of the Senate Speaker. Czech President Milos Zeman on Sunday slammed the visit to the island of Taiwan by the head of the Czech Senate, calling it a ""boyish provocation."" Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on the same day that Vystrcil didn't understand the bigger world and he will try to prevent losses for Czech firms.Vystrcil has turned his back on the island of Taiwan after returning to Czech Republic, arguing that he never violated the one-China principle or called Taiwan an independent country. However, the attempt at verbal sleight is not persuasive enough to dispel doubts in the market.In his attempt to seek extenuation, Vystrcil neither acknowledged his wrongdoing nor made an apology. The Czech Senate hasn't made any form of statement to clarify that such wrongdoing which severely undermines China's core national interests will be completely eradicated in the future. After hurting the Chinese people's feelings and not doing anything to repair the damage to the bilateral relations, how can one expect that the business activities will be carried out as usual?The move has already impacted the public opinion and foundation of China-Czech relations. Out of spontaneous reactions to protect their own interests, it is difficult for the Chinese people and companies to continue to cooperate with Czech business partners with confidence. Therefore, some Czech businessmen in China might continue to find themselves in a difficult spot, especially when marketing their products as Czech.To dispel such anxiety in the market, it's necessary for Vystrcil or the Czech Senate to make a clarification and apology about his Taiwan visit in a timely manner, so as to eliminate the baneful influence of the erroneous action and avoid further harm to the overall trade and economic cooperation between the two countries.The author is director of the Department of European Studies, China Institute of International Studies. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	9/17/20	0	0	-0.9913	-1
"Taiwan's hopes for US visit 'wishful thinking', to get nothingnUS Undersecretary of State Keith Krach alights from an aircraft after landing at the Sungshan airport in Taipei on Thursday. Photo: AFP US Undersecretary of State Keith Krach's visit to Taiwan can infuriate the Chinese mainland, and he avoided touching on the trade and investment agreement with the island, which can benefit the people of the island, said experts, noting that the US is just making use of rather than helping Taiwan.The US also let its ambassador to the UN meet with Taiwan's economic and cultural representative in New York.Chinese mainland experts warned that the Trump administration is shaking the political foundations of the China-US relations.China will make a ""necessary response"" to a visit by Krach to the island of Taiwan, and China urges the US to stop all forms of official exchanges with the island, Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said on Thursday, ahead of Krach's arrival.At the routine press conference on Thursday, Wang said that since the US insists on sending Krach to the island of Taiwan, Washington has seriously violated the three joint communiqués between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America, and encouraged Taiwan separatism, and damaged China-US relations and the stability of the Taiwan Straits.""China expressed firm opposition to this and has made solemn representations to the US,"" he noted.Krach, the most senior US State Department official to visit the island since 1979, arrived in Taipei on Thursday afternoon, according to the Taiwan media focustaiwan.tw.He is in Taiwan for a memorial service on Saturday for the island's former regional leader Lee Teng-hui, who is considered the ""godfather of Taiwan separatism,"" with most Chinese people worldwide considering him a traitor of the Chinese nation.Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday that sending such a senior official to Lee's memorial service is delivering a clear message - that of US support and encouragement of Lee's ideology, namely the Taiwan separatism.This is truly dangerous, Li said, because the Trump administration has violated the promise made by the US government when it established diplomatic ties with China in the late 1970s, and has shaken the political foundations of the bilateral relations.In the December 1978 joint communiqué with China, the US said ""the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal Government of China,"" and ""The Government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China, and Taiwan is part of China.""Taiwan media reported that Krach could also attend an ""economic talk,"" and will focus on the implementation of Taiwan's import of problematic US agriculture products, such as pork containing the additive ractopamine. But eventually, according to the US State Department on Wednesday, Krach will not attend the economic talk.Before the formal announcement by the US, the island's pro-separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority leaked the possible schedule to the media to give itself more diplomatic credit. This shows the DPP authority's wishful thinking to Washington. But the Trump administration just wants to use it to provoke the Chinese mainland, but is unwilling to offer anything more, such as discussing the possibility of signing a trade and investment agreement with the island, Chinese mainland experts said.Chang Ya-chung, a Taipei-based professor at National Taiwan University, told the Global Times previously when Lee died on July 30, ""The DPP authority will make full use of his death to gain more international support for its separatist cause.""Washington wants to use Krach's visit to send a clear signal to Beijing - ""The island of Taiwan must 100 percent obey the US,"" and further worsening cross-Straits relations is the priority of Krach's visit, rather than economic or trade issues, Chang said on Thursday.The US is using the Lee event to infuriate the Chinese mainland, and avoid talking about economic and trade issues that the residents of the island care about, Chang noted.The US is also trying to provoke China at the UN on the Taiwan question. ABC News reported on Thursday that US Ambassador to the UN Kelly Craft had lunch on Wednesday with James K.J. Lee, director of the Taipei economic and cultural office in New York.A meeting she called ""historic"" and a further step in the Trump administration's campaign to strengthen relations with the island, Craft said she and Lee ""discussed different ways that we can best help Taiwan become more engaged within the UN.""Yuan Zheng, a senior fellow at the Institute of American Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday the US knows it is impossible for the US to bring Taiwan into the UN as a formal member, because China is the permanent member of the UN Security Council which can veto such a proposal, and the move will be regarded as a declaration of cutting off diplomatic ties with China, and might lead to a war. But it seems the US is trying to use such tricks to further infuriate the Chinese mainland instead of really helping the island of Taiwan.""The Chinese mainland should send a clearer and more powerful warning to the US to let it know how serious the consequences would be,"" Yuan said.Li Haidong said if the US wants to support Taiwan to become a UN member, then Article 8 of the Anti-Secession Law of China will be activated, which means China shall use non-peaceful and other necessary means to solve the Taiwan question once and for all.The China-US relations in 2020 are facing an unprecedented challenge, as Washington is giving up its announced neutrality on the Taiwan question, and openly provoking China's sovereignty. Some Chinese mainland scholars had suggested that the Chinese government remain patient and restrained, as any reaction could be used by the Trump administration to gain greater domestic support for his reelection in November. They suggested that China not be used by the Trump administration.A Beijing-based expert on Taiwan affairs who requested anonymity told the Global Times that the US and the DPP authority believe that the Chinese mainland is facing a dilemma, because military retaliation could escalate tensions, and economic sanctions might harm the innocent people of the island and impact regional economic recovery, which is the priority in the post-pandemic era.""So the US and the Taiwan separatist authority are challenging and provoking the mainland again and again. But they have underestimated the mainland's capability and wisdom,"" he said.Taiwan media reported on Thursday that two Chinese mainland anti-submarine aircraft flew into ""Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ)"" on Wednesday, according to the island's ""defense authority.""""Some Taiwan-based experts said the PLA could engage in small-scale military actions, such as striking Taiwan targets with short- or medium-range missiles, and then the fragile economy of the island, which heavily relies on the mainland market, will soon collapse. This is a reasonable speculation to some extent,"" he noted. "	9/18/20	0	0	0.9738	1
"Krach's Taiwan visit maims China tiesnFile Photo: VCG From Thursday to Saturday, US Undersecretary of State Keith Krach will visit the island of Taiwan in the name of attending memorial for former Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui. He is the highest-ranking State Department official to visit the island in 41 years.This marks the latest US move to play the Taiwan card against the Chinese mainland, though the US has no qualms about upgrading its relations with the island. It indicates that Washington has disregarded the overall interests of China-US relations and its commitment to the Chinese government. China-US relations and cross-Straits relations will face new major challenges.Taiwan has become the new battleground in the strategic game between China and the US. In recent years, under the banner of ""America First"" and slogans like ""China is taking advantage of the US,"" US President Donald Trump has repeatedly set up obstacles on trade, science and technology, finance, people-to-people exchanges, the South China Sea, and Hong Kong to contain China.Meanwhile, the Trump administration has failed to bring China to its knees, let alone bring China down. In this context, the US resorted to the Taiwan card.As is well known to all, the Taiwan question is the most sensitive and core issue in China-US relations. In December 2016, US President Trump made an attempt to play the Taiwan card through a phone call with Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen before he took office. However, he maintained a relatively stable policy toward Taiwan before 2020.Statements by senior US officials, arms sales and visits to Taiwan since this year show that the US has shifted its strategic focus to the Taiwan Straits.The US has seriously undermined its strategic commitment to China. The foundation of China-US relations is the Three Joint Communiqués - the core of which is the Taiwan question. The US previously made a series of commitments to China regarding Taiwan, including that it will abide by the one-China principle and that it will not develop formal political relations with Taiwan. Moreover, US declared it would gradually reduce arms sales to the island.In the past few years, those in the US breaking promises to China and violating the one-China principle have been its pro-Taiwan forces, including senators. This year, Trump joined this cabal. Since the second half of 2020, Trump has successively sent US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Undersecretary of State Krach to the island. This demonstrates how the executive branch of the US is implementing its pro-Taiwan bill - the Taiwan Travel Act.Washington's recent moves, such as selling 66 F-16 fighter jets and heavy weight torpedoes to Taiwan, illustrate that the Trump administration not only fails to comply with the joint communiqué issued by China and the US on August 17, 1982, but it also violates the Taiwan Relations Act issued by US Congress in 1979 that requires the US to have a policy to provide Taiwan defensive, not offensive, arms.In other words, the executive branch of the Trump administration has gone much further than lawmakers in impairing China-US ties.Krach's visit to Taiwan has been hyped up by Tsai authorities as a US reward to Tsai authorities for easing restrictions on imports of US beef and pork with clenbuterol, a banned substance. They see Krach's visit as a crucial step for the US to sign an economic and trade agreement with them.However, Krach's visit to Taiwan is in the name of Lee Teng-hui's memorial service, which not only exposes US ulterior intentions but also greed.By sending Krach to the island, the US wants to deliver a message that the US stands with the secessionist ideas represented by Lee Teng-hui.After lifting US pork and beef import ban, Taiwan cannot make further concessions and Washington cannot gain more benefits. Therefore, the Trump administration decided to pile more pressure on Taiwan with Krach's absence of the economic dialogue. It reveals that the island is only a chess piece for the US to contain China and grab more profits.The author is an associate research fellow of the Institute of Taiwan Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	9/17/20	0	0	-0.7402	-1
"Huawei crisis 'warning bells' for China's high-tech supply chainnA robotic arm manufacturer in Dongguan, South China’s Guangdong Province, displays some products for testing. The factory, like many other Chinese tech companies, is now stepping up efforts to accelerate its self-developed technologies. Photo: Chen Qingqing/GT In the areas neighboring Huawei's research and development base in Songshanhu of Dongguan, South China's Guangdong Province, it was not hard to find a range of high-tech companies thriving on booming digital services amid COVID-19. But for some industry representatives in the high-tech sector, it's hard to turn a blind eye to what Huawei has been experiencing in recent days amid a heightened US-China tech war.""It's never been more urgent for us to make breakthroughs in core technologies,"" a supplier of Huawei, located miles away from Huawei's R&D base and producing components for telecom equipment like base station and fiber-optic network, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Wednesday was also the second day of the latest US ban to cut off chip supply to Huawei, which apparently became an unavoidable topic among engineers, technicians and employees over the lunch break or coffee time in industrial parks in Dongguan, home to hundreds of factories making various types of products ranging from raw materials to components for electronic gadgets.At the factory supplying key components for Huawei for building 5G base stations and fiber-optic networks, workers wearing dust-proof suits focused on delicate work with the help of self-developed machines. ""90 percent of our technologies are homegrown, and for the remaining 10 percent we need to depend on foreign firms, like US tech firm Intel,"" a senior manager of this factory who preferred not to be identified told the Global Times on Wednesday.He also did not want to disclose the identity of the factory as it also provides some highly sensitive materials for major aerospace and key infrastructures.""The whole industry now is working around the clock to break the US blockage. This sense of urgency will surely help speed up progress,"" he said.Chinese leaders, officials and top Chinese science and technology institutes have intensively called on making technological breakthroughs on a series of core technologies in recent days as more industry representatives see the Huawei crisis ""a warning shot"" that fully exposed the vulnerability of China's high-tech growth.Bai Chunli, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, also suggested on Wednesday to turn technologies mentioned in US Entity List into China's future scientific research layout, for example, development of key raw materials and mask aligner for making chipset. A robotic arm manufacturer in Dongguan, South China’s Guangdong Province, displays some products for testing. The factory, like many other Chinese tech companies, is now stepping up efforts to accelerate its self-developed technologies. Photo: Chen Qingqing/GT When Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng visited Wuhan from Monday to Tuesday, a city hard-hit by the coronavirus outbreak, he also urged focusing on making breakthroughs on core technologies in confronting ""cut-throat"" battle, and increasing self-reliance in supplies of fundamental materials.For some Chinese tech companies that have been expanding in overseas markets for decades, it's time now to accelerate the ""de-Americanization"" campaign while playing down their ""roots in China"", given the Trump administration's campaign to target more Chinese tech firms such as WeChat and ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, amid escalating US-China tech war.""We are now further localizing our business in foreign markets by setting up regional headquarters, moving both R&D centers and production lines to countries like Thailand and Brazil,"" Wu Xinke, general manager of international business of ZKTeco Co, biometric verification technology provider based in Dongguan, told the Global Times on Thursday.Offering facial scan and other secure access tools to small and medium-sized enterprises, ZKTeco is not exactly the same as other Chinese surveillance companies such as Hikvision and Dahua. However, the yearlong crackdowns on those Chinese firms have forced it to come up with long-term plans on both technology and business fronts.""Our core technologies are now 100 percent self-developed, and we will continue investing 15 to 20 percent of our revenues in R&D,"" Wu said.It's also important to partially reduce reliance on the supply chain in China. For extreme situations, Chinese firms need to find alternative plans by redirecting their raw materials and components to ensure stability of supplies amid US pressure, the senior executive said.In order to reduce the reliance on US technologies such as core chipsets, more Chinese tech firms are now seeking to enhance partnership with companies in countries and regions such as South Korea, Japan and the island of Taiwan, according to some industry representatives in Dongguan.""The next six months and a year would be very difficult for some firms, for example, the ban on chipset would severely affect not only upstream firms like HiSilicon [chipset division of Huawei] but also downstream companies, but we'll get through it,"" Wu said.

"US sale of weapons systems to Taiwan island is media speculation: Taiwan authoritiesnTaiwan Photo: Unsplash The Taiwan ""defense authorities"" said on Wednesday that media reports of US plans to sell seven major weapons systems to the island were merely speculation by local media, huanqiu.com reported on Thursday.The arms purchase under evaluation or negotiation will be handled under the principle of confidentiality, and will not be disclosed to the public, as is the usual practice, until the US officially notifies ""the Congress"", Taiwan authorities stated.The media reports cited four ""exclusive"" sources of information, saying that the US intends to sell as many as seven major weapons systems to Taiwan island, including mines, cruise missiles, and drones, amid the mounting pressures China is facing from the Trump administration, Reuters reported on Wednesday.The Chinese Foreign Ministry responded earlier to the question of the US arms sales to Taiwan island, saying that it seriously breached the one-China principle and the three joint communiqués, especially the August 17 communiqué, severely undermining China's sovereignty and security, as well as basic norms of international relations, and China firmly opposes the move.In July, the US State Department approved a request from Taiwan island to recertify its Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missiles for an estimated cost of $620 million.Following the move, China imposed sanctions on the main contractor of the sale, Lockheed Martin , to protect its national interests.The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson responded to this move at a regular press briefing, stating that China firmly opposes US arms sales to Taiwan, and urged the US to honor its commitment to the one-China principle and the three joint communiqués.The US should cut off military ties with Taiwan island to avoid further damaging China-US relations as well as the peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, FM spokesperson Zhao Lijian said.Global Times "	9/17/20	0	0	-0.2023	-1
"Tsai's risky secessionist collusion with US brings trouble to Taiwan societynTaiwan Photo: Unsplash Relations between the US and the island of Taiwan have substantively accelerated during this US presidential election cycle. US Under Secretary of State Keith Krach will reportedly visit the island from Thursday to Saturday and participate in economic dialogues. He will be the highest-level incumbent US Department of State official to visit Taiwan since 1979 if his trip will be paid as reported. However, even so, Krach's probable visit will be more of a political show.There are several background issues.Firstly, the visit was announced by Tsai Ing-wen authorities after lifting limits on imports of US pork, which contains ractopamine, starting from January 1, 2021. The visit will unsurprisingly be heated up as a so-called breakthrough in the island's relations with Washington.Secondly, the Trump administration has significantly elevated the strategic status of Taiwan by gradually implementing the 2018 Taiwan Travel Act. Shortly after cabinet-level official Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar's trip to the island, the visit of Krach further demonstrates that the US and the island are trying to sound out the bottom line of the Chinese mainland.Thirdly, the US is at a critical stage in the presidential election. Both the Democratic and Republican parties support strengthening substantive ties with Taiwan. And the Trump administration prefers to play the ""Taiwan card"" and put high-level interactions with the island on the table as an election ploy.Apart from the blind exultation of some secessionist groups, Taiwan people are more concerned about what practical benefits they might get from the US. Taiwan society once hoped to see Azar's commitment to providing COVID-19 vaccines to Taiwan. However, it turned out that Washington wanted to have the island act as a supply chain partner for US healthcare, using it to serve US interests in the first place.Some Taiwan business people believe that the higher-level US officials pay visit to the island, the more Washington will demand from the island. The invitation of Tsai authorities for Krach was a move that sought to get the US to the bargaining table of a so-called free trade agreement. But Taiwan people are questioning whether pork imports can actually be leveraged in exchange for the deal.Taiwan has never managed to hold an equal position in trade talks with the US, but has been commanded by Washington to open its market wider. Ractopamine-enhanced pork will highly endanger Taiwan people's health, but this is not of concern of the US. The ""America First"" principle espoused by Trump, which aims at protecting US economic and trade interests, will not change due to Tsai authorities' role as a pawn in the China-US strategic game.The Trump administration's suspension of talks with Taiwan on the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement for three years has been a strong illustration of US' tough stance. Therefore, Taiwan people worry that the Trump administration's bullying will force the island to open more markets once trade talks restart. This then will probably require Taiwan to increase its agricultural import quotas and expand the opening of its food and financial markets.Krach's visit to Taiwan will send a political signal to the island. David Stilwell, US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said at an event on August 31 that the Six Assurances provided by President Ronald Reagan to the island of Taiwan in 1982 were still valid today. He said, ""The US has long had a one-China policy. This is distinct from Beijing's 'One China Principle.'"" From such remarks, we can see the Trump administration's efforts to undermine the ""one-China"" policy will not change. With US' support, Tsai authorities will continue to send ""ministerial"" officials to the US for political activities, and also seek higher ""political treatment"" for Tsai's stopover in to the US.The Chinese mainland firmly opposes provocations against the one-China principle. It will continue to urge the US to appropriately handle the Taiwan question, setting redlines to sternly curb secessionist moves.The Chinese mainland has an adequate ""toolbox"" to stabilize the cross-Straits situation and resist outside interference. It has every legitimate reason to restrict the entry of US politicians who collude with Taiwan secessionist forces to infringe upon the one-China principle. The mainland is totally legitimate to crack down on the secessionist organizations and individuals on the island. Any risky secessionist act by Tsai authorities in collusion with the US will bear corresponding consequences. This may even bring trouble to the whole of Taiwan society.The author is associate research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	9/16/20	0	0	0.8741	1
"Krach's visit to bring misfortune to Taiwan: Global Times editorialnIllustration: Xia Qing/GT According to media reports from the island of Taiwan, US Undersecretary of State Keith Krach will arrive on the island on Thursday and host the ""US-Taiwan Economic and Commercial Dialogue."" Since US undersecretary of state is different from deputy officials from other US government departments, Krach's tour is considered by all parties on the island as more sensitive. They think Krach's visit is the latest manifestation of an upgrade in official relations between the US and the island of Taiwan.On Wednesday, Reuters reported the US is pushing a surge in arms sales to the island of Taiwan - Washington plans to sell ""seven weapons systems, including mines, cruise missiles and drones"" at once.The US and the island of Taiwan continue to adopt the ""salami tactics"" to expand the space for their ties, increasing US arms sales to the island, and attempting to force the Chinese mainland to swallow such a trend. They keep throwing stones into the water of the Taiwan Straits. But once they go too far, the stones may become torpedoes, increasing the uncertainties in the entire region, as well as the risks of drastic changes in the Taiwan Straits.A strategic game of the century between China and the US is being shaped. This is a reality every country and every force in the Asia-Pacific region have to face. Among all regional forces, the Taiwan authorities are the most stupid. Smart ones would go after profit and avoid harm, seeking to butter their bread on both sides in the China-US game. But the Taiwan authorities are destroying their strategic maneuvering ability by completely siding with the US, turning itself into a pawn and a punching bag of the US, bearing the growing risk of an outbreak of a military conflict in the Taiwan Straits.The Taiwan authorities often brag about ""freedom and democracy"" in the island, which are self-comforting empty slogans. The Taiwan authorities have no politically reliable strategic plans. They have no idea what Taiwan's future will be like, and cannot predict what strategic resources Taiwan's ""freedom and democracy"" could bring to the island to confront the mainland.Could Taiwan become a sovereign state? Such a goal is as illusory as Taiwan could one day drift to the side of the US. The Taiwan authorities are clear that the best-case scenario is to maintain the status quo. Their de-Sinicization campaigns in the island and pursuit of US support are self-entertaining tricks that serve their ambitions. But from a historical point of view, those are nothing but bubbles.The authorities of Democratic Progressive Party throwing themselves into the lap of the US will lead to a deformed political mentality and security value within the island, narrowing the path the island can take. No surrounding countries and regions will take US protection as a lifeline as much as the island of Taiwan does, nor will they act beyond their abilities to engage in a confrontation with the Chinese mainland. Taiwan will become an exception in the region. It will be anxious for gains and losses in the long run, and plagued by imaginary fears.Fully relying on the US will make the island of Taiwan subject to the willful exploitation of the US. The Tsai Ing-wen authorities lifted import restrictions on US pork and beef as a reward for the visit of US health and human services secretary Alex Azar. Many people wonder how Taiwan will be taken advantage of from Krach's trip. US is increasing its arms sale to Taiwan, it that a part of the deal? Once the People's Liberation Army dispatches troops to reunify the island of Taiwan, the military equipment from the US will be nothing but decorations. The arms sales to Taiwan are a mechanism for Washington to blackmail the island.International law clearly states that Taiwan is not a country. The US and the island of Taiwan are attempting to upgrade their official ties, and the island is trying to receive greater ""country-level treatment"" from the US. This constitutes the biggest change to the status quo in the Taiwan Straits, and a continuing source of tensions in the region. The further the US and Taiwan island go in this direction, the more likely the situation in the Taiwan Straits will spiral out of control. Taiwan will suffer the most. Promoting relations with the US is nothing but a way to quench its thirst by drinking poison.The Taiwan authorities are putting the security and well-being of people on the island in jeopardy. They are leading the island into a blind alley. An increasing number of people are worried that the Taiwan Straits will be the most likely powder keg in the China-US competition. People on the island will be plunged into misery. If that day comes, Taiwan authorities will be an unforgivable sinner for both the island and the rest of China. "	9/16/20	0	0	0.6681	1
"Krach's visit to Taiwan should be punished: expertnTaiwan Photo:VCG The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council on Wednesday urged the US to stop official exchanges with the island of Taiwan, because the Taiwan question is China's internal affair and not open to interference from foreign forces, as the US is planning to send US Undersecretary of State Keith Krach to Taiwan this week for ""economic talks"" with the authority of the island.Chinese mainland experts noted that the US has increased its provocation to try to push back China's bottom line on the Taiwan question, and Washington could further provoke before the US presidential election in November.The Trump administration believes that China is being restrained at the moment and is waiting for the results of the US election, and that the Chinese mainland will not react to US provocations on Taiwan, the analysts said. They said China should take actions to make the US feel the pain. Otherwise, the US could send more officials to Taiwan, and other countries might also follow the US suit.Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson of the Taiwan Affairs Office, said at a press conference on Wednesday that ""we urge the US to strictly abide by the Three Joint Communiqués,"" and ""the Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] authority ignores the opposition of people in the island, and insists on opening problematic agriculture imports from the US, which will harm public health on the island.""After US Secretary of Health and Human Resources Alex Azar visited Taiwan in August, the separatist DPP authority agreed to receive US pork imports containing the additive ractopamine, and the decision has received heavy criticism in the island. Krach's visit will focus on the implementation of the decision.Taiwan media reported that the DPP authority is also planning to invite US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to visit Taiwan.Chinese analysts said what the Trump administration wants is to gain economic interests rather than adding credit to the DPP authority and over-provoking the mainland. So Ross is unlikely to visit Taiwan as this will surely infuriate the Chinese mainland. Experts said as long as the US sends senior officials to Taiwan, the mainland will retaliate.""High-level economic talks"" between the island of Taiwan and the US will reportedly take place on Friday, with discussions expected to touch on restructuring supply chains and economic cooperation in the region. Krach will attend the event, Taiwan media reported on Sunday.Krach's visit will not be finalized until the Trump administration makes a formal announcement, a Taiwan media report cited a source familiar with the matter as saying. Should the visit be confirmed, Krach will be the second high-level US official to visit Taiwan this year, following Azar's trip last month.Yuan Zheng, a senior fellow of the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the Trump administration wants to gain more economic and trade results from the island to show off to American voters before the election, and the DPP authority, which is flattering the US, is willing to cooperate, so the health of Taiwan residents has been traded by the DPP authority.""But the Trump administration is breaking a tacit understanding with China. In the past, US officials sent to visit Taiwan were no higher than assistant secretary of state. The current upgrade is a very serious provocation,"" Yuan said.A Chinese expert familiar with the matter who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Wednesday that in order to reduce the risk of direct conflict in the Western Pacific, since the US expects China to ""fire the first shot,"" relevant Chinese departments and the People's Liberation Army have been very much restrained even if they also conducted a series of drills. So the US might think that it can take more provocative actions to push China's bottom line back a bit.This attempt is dangerous, because if Washington underestimates China's determination to retaliate, the US could send more senior officials from other departments, such as the Department of Defense, to Taiwan, and other countries could follow to develop their security or political ties with the island of Taiwan, and this will seriously damage China's sovereignty, and will break the peace in the region, Yuan said.The visit of the Czech Republic's senate speaker to Taiwan earlier this month is a very bad signal to the international community as well. After Krach's visit this week, some countries might believe that they can use official exchanges with Taiwan to get economic or other benefits from the island, therefore China must take actions to send a clear message, Yuan stressed.Chinese mainland experts said that to prevent a military conflict, the Chinese mainland can consider slapping economic sanctions to make those countries and politicians feel the pain, as China has had successful experiences in the past.Apart from sending a senior official to the island, the US also plans to sell as many as seven major weapons systems, including mines, cruise missiles and drones, to Taiwan, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing four people familiar with the discussions.The weapons packages from Lockheed Martin, Boeing and General Atomics are moving their way through the export process, three people familiar with the status of the deals on Capitol Hill said, and a notification to the Congress is expected within weeks.""In 1992, the Chinese mainland retaliated to French arm sales to Taiwan by canceling several major economic and infrastructure cooperation deals, including the Guangzhou metro construction and nuclear power station project. European countries realized this, and after that French case, they haven't sold arms to the island,"" Yuan said.China has done something to make other countries respect its sovereignty, so this measure can be used again, Yuan noted.On July 14, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced sanctions against US arms dealer Lockheed Martin for its previous arm sales of Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missiles to the island.He noted that ""we don't want any trouble, but sometimes, the US just forces you to take action. So we need to let the US know that being restrained to prevent a conflict doesn't mean a compromise to any provocation.""The experts said the Chinese mainland is likely to sanction the US officials and the firms who sell the problematic pork to Taiwan.

Should the visit be confirmed, Krach will be the second high-level US official to visit Taiwan this year, following Azar's trip last month.Yuan Zheng, a senior fellow of the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the Trump administration wants to gain more economic and trade results from the island to show off to American voters before the election, and the DPP authority, which is flattering the US, is willing to cooperate, so the health of Taiwan residents has been traded by the DPP authority.""But the Trump administration is breaking a tacit understanding with China. In the past, US officials sent to visit Taiwan were no higher than assistant secretary of state. The current upgrade is a very serious provocation,"" Yuan said.A Chinese expert familiar with the matter who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Wednesday that in order to reduce the risk of direct conflict in the Western Pacific, since the US expects China to ""fire the first shot,"" relevant Chinese departments and the People's Liberation Army have been very much restrained even if they also conducted a series of drills. So the US might think that it can take more provocative actions to push China's bottom line back a bit.This attempt is dangerous, because if Washington underestimates China's determination to retaliate, the US could send more senior officials from other departments, such as the Department of Defense, to Taiwan, and other countries could follow to develop their security or political ties with the island of Taiwan, and this will seriously damage China's sovereignty, and will break the peace in the region, Yuan said.The visit of the Czech Republic's senate speaker to Taiwan earlier this month is a very bad signal to the international community as well. After Krach's visit this week, some countries might believe that they can use official exchanges with Taiwan to get economic or other benefits from the island, therefore China must take actions to send a clear message, Yuan stressed.Chinese mainland experts said that to prevent a military conflict, the Chinese mainland can consider slapping economic sanctions to make those countries and politicians feel the pain, as China has had successful experiences in the past.Apart from sending a senior official to the island, the US also plans to sell as many as seven major weapons systems, including mines, cruise missiles and drones, to Taiwan, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing four people familiar with the discussions.The weapons packages from Lockheed Martin, Boeing and General Atomics are moving their way through the export process, three people familiar with the status of the deals on Capitol Hill said, and a notification to the Congress is expected within weeks.""In 1992, the Chinese mainland retaliated to French arm sales to Taiwan by canceling several major economic and infrastructure cooperation deals, including the Guangzhou metro construction and nuclear power station project. European countries realized this, and after that French case, they haven't sold arms to the island,"" Yuan said.China has done something to make other countries respect its sovereignty, so this measure can be used again, Yuan noted.On July 14, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced sanctions against US arms dealer Lockheed Martin for its previous arm sales of Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missiles to the island.He noted that ""we don't want any trouble, but sometimes, the US just forces you to take action. So we need to let the US know that being restrained to prevent a conflict doesn't mean a compromise to any provocation.""The experts said the Chinese mainland is likely to sanction the US officials and the firms who sell the problematic pork to Taiwan.

"Krach's visit to bring misfortune to Taiwan: Global Times editorialnIllustration: Xia Qing/GT According to media reports from the island of Taiwan, US Undersecretary of State Keith Krach will arrive on the island on Thursday and host the ""US-Taiwan Economic and Commercial Dialogue."" Since US undersecretary of state is different from deputy officials from other US government departments, Krach's tour is considered by all parties on the island as more sensitive. They think Krach's visit is the latest manifestation of an upgrade in official relations between the US and the island of Taiwan.On Wednesday, Reuters reported the US is pushing a surge in arms sales to the island of Taiwan - Washington plans to sell ""seven weapons systems, including mines, cruise missiles and drones"" at once.The US and the island of Taiwan continue to adopt the ""salami tactics"" to expand the space for their ties, increasing US arms sales to the island, and attempting to force the Chinese mainland to swallow such a trend. They keep throwing stones into the water of the Taiwan Straits. But once they go too far, the stones may become torpedoes, increasing the uncertainties in the entire region, as well as the risks of drastic changes in the Taiwan Straits.A strategic game of the century between China and the US is being shaped. This is a reality every country and every force in the Asia-Pacific region have to face. Among all regional forces, the Taiwan authorities are the most stupid. Smart ones would go after profit and avoid harm, seeking to butter their bread on both sides in the China-US game. But the Taiwan authorities are destroying their strategic maneuvering ability by completely siding with the US, turning itself into a pawn and a punching bag of the US, bearing the growing risk of an outbreak of a military conflict in the Taiwan Straits.The Taiwan authorities often brag about ""freedom and democracy"" in the island, which are self-comforting empty slogans. The Taiwan authorities have no politically reliable strategic plans. They have no idea what Taiwan's future will be like, and cannot predict what strategic resources Taiwan's ""freedom and democracy"" could bring to the island to confront the mainland.Could Taiwan become a sovereign state? Such a goal is as illusory as Taiwan could one day drift to the side of the US. The Taiwan authorities are clear that the best-case scenario is to maintain the status quo. Their de-Sinicization campaigns in the island and pursuit of US support are self-entertaining tricks that serve their ambitions. But from a historical point of view, those are nothing but bubbles.The authorities of Democratic Progressive Party throwing themselves into the lap of the US will lead to a deformed political mentality and security value within the island, narrowing the path the island can take. No surrounding countries and regions will take US protection as a lifeline as much as the island of Taiwan does, nor will they act beyond their abilities to engage in a confrontation with the Chinese mainland. Taiwan will become an exception in the region. It will be anxious for gains and losses in the long run, and plagued by imaginary fears.Fully relying on the US will make the island of Taiwan subject to the willful exploitation of the US. The Tsai Ing-wen authorities lifted import restrictions on US pork and beef as a reward for the visit of US health and human services secretary Alex Azar. Many people wonder how Taiwan will be taken advantage of from Krach's trip. US is increasing its arms sale to Taiwan, it that a part of the deal? Once the People's Liberation Army dispatches troops to reunify the island of Taiwan, the military equipment from the US will be nothing but decorations. The arms sales to Taiwan are a mechanism for Washington to blackmail the island.International law clearly states that Taiwan is not a country. The US and the island of Taiwan are attempting to upgrade their official ties, and the island is trying to receive greater ""country-level treatment"" from the US. This constitutes the biggest change to the status quo in the Taiwan Straits, and a continuing source of tensions in the region. The further the US and Taiwan island go in this direction, the more likely the situation in the Taiwan Straits will spiral out of control. Taiwan will suffer the most. Promoting relations with the US is nothing but a way to quench its thirst by drinking poison.The Taiwan authorities are putting the security and well-being of people on the island in jeopardy. They are leading the island into a blind alley. An increasing number of people are worried that the Taiwan Straits will be the most likely powder keg in the China-US competition. People on the island will be plunged into misery. If that day comes, Taiwan authorities will be an unforgivable sinner for both the island and the rest of China. "	9/16/20	0	0	0.6681	1
"Steady China-Japan ties expected as Suga picks continuity cabinetnYoshihide Suga (center) is inaugurated Japan's 99th Prime Minister on Wednesday. Photo: AFP Members of Japan's new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's cabinet were revealed on Wednesday after Suga was nominated Japan's 99th prime minister. The new cabinet keeps in place eight ministers from Shinzo Abe's team, suggesting that the new administration may continue Abe's policies toward China, analysts said.Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday congratulated Suga on his election as Japan's new prime minister.Suga's new cabinet includes many familiar faces as he vowed to stay the course set by his predecessor, Kyodo News reported. Chinese observers noted that Suga's cabinet is likely to promote ""innovation and reform"" slogans, such as a constitutional amendment, but unlikely to make big policy changes as the new administration is meant to safeguard stability.The new administration will focus on reviving Japan's battered economy, control its COVID-19 situation, and keep regional disputes with Asian neighbors, including China and South Korea, under control, analysts said.The new defense minister, Nobuo Kishi, is Abe's younger brother and grandson of the late Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi. He has never served in a senior government capacity, but Kishi had visited the island of Taiwan several times in recent years, prompting Taiwan media to hype him as ""super friendly"" to the island.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin congratulated Kishi at Wednesday's press conference, and noted that China hopes Japan abides by the one-China principle and refrains from official exchanges with the island of Taiwan.Liu Junhong, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, who specializes in Japan affairs, told the Global Times that Japanese politicians ""know fairly well"" of the pros and cons of a relationship with the island and Chinese mainland, and that Kishi is unlikely to continue the visits.The Chinese Foreign Ministry's comment is a gentle reminder to Japanese officials to respect China's bottom line, Liu noted.Previous defense minister Taro Kono was nominated as administrative reform minister. Kono is active on social media, and in June, he made the decision to halt the government's plan to deploy the US-developed Aegis Ashore missile interception system.As for China-Japan relations, Liu said the main trend will be stability, although some setbacks could occur as disputes still exist, and as China-US tensions escalate. ""Suga is wise enough to keep disputes under control,"" he said.Experts stressed that Japan's diplomatic strategy will also be adjusted according to the results of the US presidential election. Japan will continue to tie itself to an alliance with the US, while also developing its relations with China to maximize its interests, analysts said. "	9/16/20	0	0	0.9836	1
"KMT cancels delegation to Straits ForumnWang Jin-pyng Photo: Chinatimes.com The Kuomintang (KMT), an opposition party in the island of Taiwan, announced on Monday that it will not send a delegation to attend the Straits Forum that is scheduled to be held in Xiamen, Fujian Province, because it felt ""insulted"" after a mainland TV news program said the KMT is asking the mainland for peace amid the intense cross-Straits situation.Originally, the KMT planned to send the former vice president of the party - Wang Jin-pyng - to lead the delegation to the forum, which will be held by the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council on Saturday.However, after the KMT announced its decision, a news program of China Central Television (CCTV) reported the development with a Chinese headline on Thursday saying ""Taiwan Straits on the brink of war, this man (Wang) will come to 'ask for peace' (in Chinese: Qiuhe)."" The headline had a significant impact on public opinion within the island, as many people considered it an insult.Later, the mainland's Taiwan Affairs Office on Friday said in a statement that it welcomed the KMT's decision, noting that ""the two sides of the Taiwan Straits are families, so we should pay joint efforts to safeguard the peace of the Straits and contribute more to boosting mutual understanding and mutual-trust.""Li Hong, an anchorwoman of the CCTV news program, also explained that ""Qiuhe"" means ""seeking peace"", which was not meant to insult the KMT at all, but the party and the media of the island widely claimed that ""Qiuhe"" means ""begging for peace"" and the pro-separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), as well as other pro-separatist groups in Taiwan, are using the incident to hype anti-mainland sentiment.But in fact, the news program mainly focuses on interviews with scholars and experts from both Taiwan and the mainland, who analyze news about cross-Straits affairs, so it represents very diverse opinions from both sides. The welcoming attitude held by the Taiwan Affairs Office of the mainland has never changed.Li Fei, a professor at the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University in East China's Fujian Province, told the Global Times that when the new president of the KMT Chiang Chi-chen was elected in March, he intended to abandon ""the 1992 Consensus"" and make the KMT more localized and less pro-reunification, so at that time, ""the KMT had no foundation to make any formal exchange with the mainland.""The Straits Forum in Xiamen is a platform for civilian and people-to-people exchanges, mainly in the business and cultural circles, rather than a political or security forum. It does not not intend to hold any ""peace negotiations"" at all, but since the KMT wanted to come and has vowed to return to ""the 1992 Consensus,"" the Taiwan Affairs Office expressed its welcome on Friday, the professor noted.Li Xiaobing, an expert on Taiwan affairs at Nankai University in Tianjin, said the KMT is falling into a trap set by the DPP, because the DPP doesn't want any communication with the mainland, so it used the CCTV item and distorted the news headline into an official insult, to hype the anti-mainland sentiment among the public of the island.""Within the KMT, party members have no consensus on sending a delegation, and KMT president Chiang is also reluctant to send a delegation, since he wants the party to stay away from the mainland. So the CCTV case is just an excuse for pro-localization forces within the KMT to force the leader to cancel the visit,"" Li Xiaobing noted.Chinese mainland analysts said that whether the KMT decides to attend or not, its decision won't affect the cross-Straits situation too much, as the KMT is not a ruling party, and the mainland bears no loss at all.However, the KMT has abandoned a chance to make itself a communicator between the two sides of the Straits amid the intense situation, and it will lose its unique political advantage when competing with the pro-separatist DPP in the future.

"Nation conducts second seaborne space launchnVideo: Shi Xiao China conducted its second seaborne space launch early Tuesday morning, with a Long March-11 solid propellant light launch vehicle lifting off from a mobile floating platform in the Yellow Sea, in waters off the coast of East China's Shandong Province.Compared with the first launch, developers have further optimized and streamlined its sea launch capabilities by deploying a new launch vessel and putting a new coastal spaceport into operation, laying a solid foundation for more frequent and regular sea missions in the future.The launch mission from sea successfully sent a group of nine commercial remote sensing satellites, all belonging to the Jilin-1 03 family, into the 535-kilometer Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO).The group of satellites launched on Tuesday were developed by the Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co Limited based in Changchun, Northeast China's Jilin Province. The satellites will provide remote sensing data and a range of services including forestry, agriculture and maritime, for their clients.""The Tuesday mission marked China's first commercial application launch from sea,"" Jin Xin, deputy commander-in-chief of the Long March-11 launch vehicle, told the Global Times on Tuesday.The Long March-11 is a light-lift solid launch vehicle, around 20 meters in length with a diameter of 2 meters, weighing about 58 tons. Before the Tuesday launch, it had conducted nine successful flights, including China's first sea launch conducted in June 2019.The assembly of the rocket for the Tuesday sea launch mission and the rocket-satellite installation were both carried out at the Dongfang Spaceport [also referred to as Eastern Aerospace Port]. The rocket was then transferred from Haiyang port in Haiyang of Shandong Province to its designated launch site. Peng Kunya, the chief designer of the Long March-11 with the China Academy of Launch Vehicle (CALT), which is overseen by the country's state-owned aerospace giant the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), called it a ""game-changer.""This practice streamlines the previous pattern, in which the manufacturing of the rocket and launch site were separate, by reducing disassembly and assembly times. It also cuts the time for long-distance rail transfer, greatly shortening the launch chain and significantly enhancing launch efficiency, Peng noted. Photo: courtesy of the CALT According to Peng, it was also the first Long March-11 sea launch mission to the SSO. ""The angle for a launch to the SSO is fixed, and once the launch site is verified, it will become routine for future missions.""Also, sea launches can effectively mitigate against post-launch safety risks, as rocket debris will fall away from populated land areas, Peng said.The developer team of the Long March-11 is working on a new solid propellant rocket model which has a two-ton payload launch capability to the Low Earth orbit, and it is expected to make its maiden experiment flight from sea by 2022, Li Tongyu, commander-in-chief of the Long March-11 carrier rocket, revealed to the Global Times.Dubbed China's fifth space launch center, construction of the Dongfang Aerospace Port as a base for sea launches of light-lift solid rockets was approved in July 2019, and concrete progress has been made, according to the CALT.With the new port now put into operation, China has now laid a foundation for regular future sea launches, CALT said in a statement to the Global Times.The Tuesday launch site is located some 350 kilometers to the southeast of the Haiyang port in Shandong in the Yellow Sea. The rocket was transported by the Debo-3 ship to the designated site before being launched from the same ship.The Debo-3 is 160 meters in length and 40 meters wide, and sails at a speed of some 20 kilometers per hour.The Long March-11 maiden flight from the sea took place on June 5, 2019, and it lifted off from the large semi-submersible barge Tairui.Unlike the Tairui, the Debo-3 can sail by itself, and is thinner and longer, making it more vulnerable to the weather and maritime conditions.The ship development team conducted a mock experiment before the mission, and felt the new ship would be able to adapt well to the changing environment at sea.The seaborne launch technology meets the growing demand for low inclination satellites and helps China provide launch services for countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative, according to Chinese experts. A Long March-11 solid-propellant light launch vehicle lifts off from a mobile floating platform in the Yellow Sea off the coast of East China's Shandong Province on Tuesday. Photo: VCG Taiwan local media on Tuesday morning paid close attention to the launch mission, which took place in the Yellow Sea.Some Taiwan media outlets called the Tuesday sea launch mission ""a serious provocation"" from the mainland, citing a mainland we-media Sina Weibo account that said in an earlier post that the rocket was expected to fly over the island of Taiwan after taking off.The island's defense authorities said it had closely monitored and taken appropriate measures.While Taiwan media obviously took the private account's post as an authoritative mainland voice and cooked up a new threat theory, Chinese space authorities had not disclosed the rocket's flight path as of press time.Taiwan media also pointed out that the sea launch mission came after the island of Taiwan started the computer-aided war games phase of its Han Kuang drills, which see the Chinese People's Liberation Army as a ""threat"", on Monday.""The launch mission is purely civilian and all satellites on board are for commercial use, which should not be overly connected with any political and military move,"" Song Zhongping, a mainland military and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Also, the SSO orbit design has determined that the rocket would have to pass the island of Taiwan, which is very normal, Song noted. ""It simply shows the guilty conscience of the Taiwan media and military as they deliberately hype the event,"" he added. "	9/15/20	0	0	0.8981	1
"US only issues 145 visas to Chinese mainland students in July due to ‘political restrictions’ and ’declining popularity’nThe US visa application webpage Photo: IC Latest statistics from the US authorities show that only 145 US student visas (F-1) were issued to Chinese mainland residents in July this year, accounting 0.7 percent of the same period last year.According to the US Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs, the US Embassy in Beijing, the US Consulate in Shanghai and the US Consulate in Guangzhou issued a total of four F-1 visas in July. In terms of nationality, only 145 Chinese mainland residents received their F-1 visas from the US Bureau of Consular Affairs in July, including renewals. In contrast, it approved more than 20,000 visas for mainland students last July.Although some attribute the sharp drop to the Trump administration's order that international students attending online classes cannot be granted a visa, statistics show that Hong Kong and Taiwan students received far more student visas (900 combined) than their mainland counterparts in the same month.Amid China-US diplomatic tensions, the tightening of the US visa policy towards China has seriously affected normal academic exchanges between the two countries.In early September, more than 1,000 Chinese students and visiting scholars in the US had their visas revoked by the US State of Department under a presidential measure by Trump, which was slammed by many observers as ""political persecution and racial discrimination"".According to Lü Xiang, a research fellow of US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the drastic fall in the number of visas granted to the Chinese mainland residents is the result of a combination of unreasonable US restrictions on Chinese mainland students and students' significantly declined wish to study in the country.Chinese students have long been an important and dynamic part of US universities, especially in science and engineering, Lü said. ""Expulsion or losing Chinese students is ultimately bound to harm US academia in the long run,"" he added. "	9/15/20	1	0	-0.6684	-1
"Taiwan businesses can't do without the mainlandnA factory run by Taiwan businessman that makes electronic components and iron-made hardware parts for various devices are equipped with automatic machines to increase production output. Photo: Chen Qingqing/GT All employees at a factory run by Taiwan businesman in Dongguan, South China's Guangdong Province, which produces furniture and mattress, have returned to work as China fully contained coronavirus epidemic. Photo: Chen Qingqing/GT In sharp contrast to flaring tensions between the island of Taiwan and the Chinese mainland, intensified by a geopolitical battle between China and the US and the coronavirus pandemic, a group of businesspeople from the island who have been doing business in Dongguan in South China's Guangdong Province, said they are remaining calm. For some, it's impossible to abandon the mainland market, even as rhetoric of ""economic decoupling"" continues to rise.""Never rely on the weather to make a living, just rely on yourself,"" reads a slogan on the walls of the factory of Stylution Int'l (China) Corp, a Taiwan furniture manufacturer, which established a production line in Dongguan more than two decades ago.Among the first batches of Taiwan businesses to invest in the mainland and witness its economic opening-up in 1990s, Stylution still values its slogan, especially as it faces growing uncertainties and a complex geopolitical environment.""The mainland's supply chain can't be replaced,"" Alex Chen, the Taiwan furniture firm's president, told the Global Times on Monday.After a yearlong trade war between the US and China, which hit furniture makers in China with higher tariffs, the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic made the situation even worse. While the separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities on the island continue instigating ""decoupling"" from the mainland, Taiwan business are heading in the opposite direction, driven by the ""natural choice"" of market demand.""It's not easy to duplicate Dongguan's comprehensive, highly integrated supply chain in other countries like Vietnam, and it's near impossible to find the same highly efficient workers in Southeast Asia,"" Chen said, noting that some Taiwan factories that had shifted production lines out of the mainland found business prospects weren't as promising as they hoped.For example, concentrated and integrated industrial chains in Dongguan, which has been dubbed the world's factory, enable businesses to reach out to their business partners and suppliers from both upper and lower streams within a maximum of three hours, and mature logistics and support facilities help shape industry clusters.From supplying raw materials to processing electronic components, factories in this southern city can make just about everything, sometimes even unimaginable things.In Kinyet Metal Products, a Taiwan stamping parts supplier in Dongguan's Chashan town where many electronic products assemblers are located, robotic arms at some automatic production lines were working relentlessly to meet production targets on Monday. Some trucks move out one by one loaded with products. There's no sign of a slowdown caused by the COVID-19 epidemic.""You can't image what we can make with those pieces of iron,"" Zhang Yanping, an employee at Kinyet, told the Global Times on Monday. The factory produces various parts and components used in electronic devices including laptops, cars, printers and other machines.""Even the camera component of an iPhone, you'll find a metal part made by us,"" she said.Lu Yongchang, president of Kinyet, started his business in the mainland in 1992, bringing new skills and fresh ideas in corporate management from Taiwan to Dongguan.Liu sees DPP chairperson Tsai Ing-wen's constant attempts to encourage economic decoupling with policies to reduce the dependence on mainland and encouraging businesses either to return to the island or move elsewhere in Asia, as empty political promises.""Building a skill-intensive factory such as a stamping parts factory in other countries is different than setting up an assembling line factory. [My factory] requires a huge number of workers and specialized training, [and moving] creates many challenges including a language barrier,"" Lu told the Global Times on Monday. Employees produce furniture and mattress at a factory run by Taiwan businessman in Dongguan, South China's Guangdong Province, on Monday. Photo: Chen Qingqing/GT After years of growth, China's industrial chain is now concentrated and integrated. By comparison, in some Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam, the industrial chain has only started to form and grow in recent years. Many enterprises that had moved to those countries still had to buy some parts from China, adding to costs, the Taiwan entrepreneur said.""Don't even mention moving back to Taiwan. Where can we get enough land? Will there be support facilities and is it easy to access suppliers from upstream and downstream?"" Lu asked. ""Don't believe in political talk, take a look at what the reality is.""Recent economic numbers back up Lu's claims, especially since the mainland is the first to resume production after containing the coronavirus. The accelerating economic recovery has rekindled hopes for Taiwan companies.In the first half of 2020, investment by Taiwan companies in mainland grew 52 percent year-on-year to $3.17 billion, official data shows.Yet deteriorating cross-Straits political relations still pose hurdles for businesspeople like Lu and Chen, who see DPP authorities' 14-day quarantine measures required of those returning from the mainland, and the very few flights between mainland and Taiwan, as ""political maneuvers"" aimed at restricting business.""Another 14-day mandatory quarantine for those who fly back to Taiwan from mainland, where the epidemic has been fully contained, brings a lot of inconvenience for business activities,"" Lu said.Then there is the Taiwan question, which has escalated the risk of a war in the Taiwan Straits. Taiwan businesspeople who live mainly on the mainland expect peaceful reunification, while the past decades have witnessed ups and downs in the cross-Straits relations.""Looking back on history, we have been speaking the same language for more than 5,000 years and we have the same cultural background, even though we have had differences for 70 years,"" Chen said, noting that there is no reason people from the two sides should be confronting each other with growing hostility.""Taiwan businesses in the mainland usually serve as the bridge. I won't lose faith in playing the role of a communicator of letting more people in Taiwan know about the mainland's huge market potential and promising business prospects,"" said Chen.

(eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Li Wei) The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) announced new maritime exercises in the Yellow Sea on Monday, as the US launched the Valiant Shield exercises around Guam, and the island of Taiwan started the computer-aided war games phase of the Han Kuang drills, with media saying both the US and Taiwan drills are aimed at the PLA.Since late July, the PLA has conducted more than 30 maritime drills in all four of its major sea regions, and experts said on Monday that the PLA is ready to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, deter the US interference and Taiwan Taiwan secessionist forces, and, if they go too far, reunify the island by force and stop possible US intervention.On Monday, the US is expected to start the Valiant Shield 2020 exercises on Guam and around the Mariana Islands Range Complex. The US Pacific Fleet said multiple warships, including the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier and USS America amphibious assault ship, 100 aircraft and 11,000 personnel from the US Navy, Air Force, Army and Marine Corps will participate in the 12-day drills.The computer-aided war games phase of Taiwan's Han Kuang drills, which have the PLA as a ""threat"" in mind, also began on Monday, reported Taiwan's Liberty Times Net. It said in a separate report on Monday that the US exercises are also a muscle-flexing move at the PLA.Guam is a US advance base in the Western Pacific, and a key nod in the second island chain aimed at containing PLA activities. The Valiant Shield features some of the main forces from multiple military branches, but Guam is within strike range of PLA missiles and bombers, a Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Monday.Taiwan's Han Kuang drills are a blatant attempt to resist reunification by force, which again showed the secessionists' ignorance on the power gap between the island and the mainland, the expert said.Also on Monday, China's Maritime Safety Administration released a navigation restriction notice, and announced that the PLA will hold military missions in the northern Yellow Sea from Monday to Sunday.Over the past two months, the PLA has conducted maritime exercises in all four major sea regions of the Chinese mainland, namely the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea and South China Sea, with the total number of exercises exceeding 30, Shanghai-based news website eastday.com reported on Sunday, noting that these are incomplete data, and there were more PLA exercises.While Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said at the routine press conference in August that the recent PLA drills in the Yellow Sea and South China Sea were annually arranged and not targeted at any country, he stressed that recent exercises by the PLA Eastern Theater Command along the Taiwan Straits were targeted at external interference and Taiwan secessionist forces.The PLA drills are not only sending a warning to the US and Taiwan secessionists, but also enhance combat capabilities to reunify the island, experts said, noting that the PLA can deter and also win a war if it comes to that.

"China-Japan ties 'uncertain' in post-Abe eranJapan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party leadership candidates Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga (center), former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba (right), and former foreign minister Fumio Kishida pose for photographs during a news conference in Tokyo on Tuesday. Photo: AFP The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan will elect its new leader on Monday who will also essentially succeed the resigned Shinzo Abe as the country's prime minister, but as rising hard-line attitudes toward China bring uncertainty to China-Japan ties, Chinese analysts warned that a worsening bilateral relationship will bring visible harm to Japan.China will handle the impact according to the change in the international situation, and Japan's new leader is not expected to abandon the benefits that have been achieved under the cooperation of the two countries in the past few years, Chinese experts said. The hostile remarks by the candidates for LDP president are likely just a show to please conservative and pro-US forces in the party to win their support, so to what extent there will be a challenge to China's core interests after the new LDP leader is voted in remains uncertain.The three candidates who are vying to be Abe's successor are Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, who has been Abe's right-hand man for almost eight years, Shigeru Ishiba, a former defense minister and a rare critic of Abe within the LDP, and Fumio Kishida, LDP's policy chief and former foreign minister.Suga promised on Saturday to stand his ground with Beijing, saying he will not be afraid to express Japan's claims to China should he become prime minister, according to Japanese media the Nikkei Asian Review.""If there are assertions that should be made, I will make those assertions at high-level talks,"" the frontrunner among the candidates for the new Japanese leadership said about China-Japan relations during a debate with his two rivals for the presidency of Japan's ruling political party, Fumio Kishida and Shigeru Ishiba.The event at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo comes ahead of Monday's election to decide the next president of the LDP. Since the LDP-led coalition controls both houses of parliament, which elect the prime minister, the next leader of the party will also succeed Prime Minister Abe, who announced his resignation last month over health reasons.Suga's main rival Ishiba was even more radical and hawkish on China during the Saturday debate. According to Taiwan media can.com, Ishiba claimed that China's Diaoyu Islands are ""Japan's inherent territory"" and said that China's recent policy on Hong Kong will affect Taiwan, and Japan must not ""sit and watch it happen.""Da Zhigang, director and research fellow of the Institute of Northeast Asian Studies at the Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences and chief expert at the Northeast Asian Strategic Studies Institute, said the candidates' tough stance on China does not necessarily lead to a dead end in China-Japan ties, despite ""the pandemic having shed light on some risks.""""Japan will not completely abandon the collaborations that have been previously negotiated, especially on the economy and trade,"" he said.Lü Yaodong, director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Japanese Studies, told the Global Times that some of their tough rhetoric was campaigning for the election. ""We'll have to review their policies after the election. Suga, for example, claimed that he will inherit Abe's domestic and foreign policy. But we can only know when he takes office.""Before announcing his resignation, Abe was making efforts to realize a trilateral cooperation deal with China and South Korea to boost post-pandemic resumption and economic recovery for Northeast Asia, but due to the worsening ties with South Korea and China on top of interruptions from the US, Japan would be unlikely to continue on with the deal. This will be a loss for Japan and the region, analysts said.Lü noted that in the long run, there will always be problems between China and Japan. ""But we should sit down and negotiate with each other, taking into account the changes in different historical periods, and then take joint measures to improve China-Japan relations,"" he said.""China will also adopt different strategies to respond in accordance with the changing situation of the international arena,"" Lü noted, which will include the result of the US election.""On the one hand, China will retaliate against Japan if it makes provocations in the future,"" Da told the Global Times. ""On the other, China will release friendly signals to encourage Japan to boost win-win cooperation.""""China will do what's better for the grand picture of China-Japan relations, but there is no room for negotiation and compromise when it comes to core national interests,"" such as sovereignty issues on the Diaoyu Islands, Hong Kong and Taiwan, Da said.Although the three candidates all hold a hard-line stance, they still want Japan to play a special role in the international arena to mediate between the two major powers in tension - China and the US.At the debate, Ishiba said if the US had cooperated with China at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, things would be much better, but Japan has a role to play in shaping a world with China-US cooperation, cna.com reported.If Japan can really provide such assistance, it would surely be welcomed by China, but unfortunately, Japan is not a real independent country that is able to mediate between the two most powerful countries on the planet. It is only Washington's loyal follower which still has huge US military presence, Chinese experts said. "	9/13/20	0	0	0.996	1
"HK secessionists’ detention ‘a warning’ for those with illusions about escape to Taiwan from justicenA rioter sets fire and destroys public facilities outside the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in south China's Hong Kong, Nov. 17, 2019. Photo:Xinhua Taiwan media reported Sunday that five fleeing Hong Kong sucessionists were detained in the island of Taiwan, and another 12 Hong Kong anti-government rioters who reportedly illegally crossed the border by water in August were announced on Sunday to be under criminal detention. These cases all represented a warning shot to Hong Kong secessionists who still hold illusions of escaping from justice.The five stowaways' current situation in Taiwan was revealed by a Taiwan media worker Edd Jhong on social media on Saturday. Jhong claimed that he had initially helped their escape but ""suggested"" that Hong Kong rioters ""not come to Taiwan anymore"" as the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is ""not as supportive"" to them as they had thought.Observers said Jhong's comment may crush the hopes of some Hong Kong rioters that they can flee to Taiwan and get substantial help there.After the enactment of the national security law for Hong Kong, Taiwan seemed to be the first choice for Hong Kong rioters who dreamed to escape from justice. But the situation of the five rioters who were detained by local authorities in the island without outside communications represents a warning shot for other Hong Kong secessionists who have similar plans, Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan at Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times on Sunday.Meanwhile, 12 Hong Kong residents have been put under criminal detention for illegally crossing the border and trying to escape to the island to seek ""political asylum"" in August said police in Shenzhen , South China's Guangdong Province on Sunday, adding that the case is under investigation.Hong Kong secessionists fleeing to Taiwan were likened to ""a drowning man who will grasp at a straw,"" which is an unrealistic illusion. Especially after Taiwan refused the entry to a Hong Kong murder suspect, there have been growing divergences in the political demands of the two sides, Li said.""Any Hong Kong separatists seeking ways to get to Taiwan are doomed to be abandoned as the regional authorities are just being opportunistic over Hong Kong issues and will only use them as political pawns,"" he said.The five Hong Kong smugglers who arrived in Taiwan in late July were said to be cut off from connection with the outside by Mainland Affairs Council and no one knows their situation, other than a few MAC staff and coast guard members, according to Jhong.""It is not so much that they have been sheltered in Taiwan, as that what they have been experiencing is even worse than other stowaways,"" read his post.Jhong later emphasized how little the DPP has done to ""save"" Hong Kong anti-government rioters and how many people in the party actually oppose ""saving"" Hong Kong.Taiwan media responded on Sunday that the five could meet lawyers and their basic rights are protected.Guangdong provincial maritime police apprehended 12 young Hong Kong residents who tried to escape to Taiwan in a speedboat on August 23. Among them, one is a member of the anti-government group ""Hong Kong Story,"" and the person was once arrested by local police for colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and violating the recently enacted national security law for Hong Kong.On Saturday, the ""families"" of six of those seized held a press conference, asking assistance from the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to bring the six suspects back to Hong Kong. They claimed that some of those arrested were not well and needed to take medicine. At the press conference, all the family members were masked.The immigration department of the HKSAR government refuted their claims, saying that relatives of 10 suspects have been in close contact with the department for updates. Authorities in Guangdong revealed that the 12 people are all physically well and have hired lawyers from the mainland.The press conference also aroused suspicions from Hong Kong residents, who questioned the real identities of these ""families"" and raised the possibility that anti-government forces in Hong Kong had hired actors to perform in order to smear the mainland.Anti-government forces in Hong Kong, with the intention of further drawing the attention of the global community — especially the US — on the matter, are trying to pass their bias toward the judicial system of the mainland to the local people and further mislead them, according to experts.""Local authorities process the case in accordance with China's Criminal Law, adhering to the principles of legality such as judgment on the basis of evidence and the presumption of innocence while the criminals' cases are processed on the record,"" Li said.

"Taiwan former legislative speaker's possible visit to mainland 'icebreaking': expertnTaiwan Photo: Unsplash While a US official's possible visit to the island of Taiwan is being condemned for challenging China's bottom line and aggravating disputes, Taiwan's former legislative speaker Wang Jin-pyng is reportedly scheduled to head for the Chinese mainland for a cross-Straits forum, over which experts expressed positive expectations and said the forum could be ""icebreaking"" for current cross-Straits relations.According to Taiwan media, Wang is to lead the Kuomintang (KMT) delegation to this year's Straits Forum in Xiamen, East China's Fujian Province which will kick off on September 19.The KMT said in a statement that amid the cross-Straits tensions, given the experience and reputation of former speaker Wang, he would surely be able to effectively convey Taiwan people's concerns about the cross-Straits situation to the mainland, and promote understanding across the Straits, media said.Given the anti-mainland stance of the separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities, which has been heightened due to its frequent interactions with the US, including US Undersecretary of State Keith Krach's upcoming visit to the island, mainland residents' goodwill toward Taiwan is declining rapidly, mainland observers said, noting the KMT delegation's possible visit serves as a precious opportunity for the mainland and rational voices in the Taiwan island to communicate.Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan from Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times on Sunday that the significance of Wang's possible visit needs to be recognized.As a senior powerful politician on the island, Wang's visit amid the tensions could make the event ""icebreaking"" for the cross-Straits situation, Li said.Some 30 events concerning epidemic control, culture, economics and youth exchange will take place during this year's forum.In contrast to Wang's possible visit that many observers on the mainland are expecting, Krach's possible visit to the island is slammed as a dangerous provocation that further pushes regional stability to the edge amid the US' frequent military provocations in the region.Taiwan media reported that the island is advancing economic dialogue and ties with the US, and may restart negotiations on the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement. Krach is in charge of economic growth, energy, and environment affairs.US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar visited the island in August and signed some cooperation documents.Ni Feng, deputy director of the Institute of American Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday that the US official's visit will definitely further escalate China-US tensions, a strategy the Trump administration is using for the election by ""playing the Taiwan card"" and hyping anti-China power in the US to win more votes.The mainland should remain calm and be cautious over being tied down by tricks and wisely deal with the Taiwan question, mainland analysts said, noting that rational forces in the island should not be fooled by the US who only uses Taiwan as a chess piece and will mercilessly abandon it when the situation changes.

"Samsung, SK Hynix would suffer from cut in supply to Huawei: analystnHuawei. Photo: VCG South Korean firms Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are reportedly applying for licenses from the US Department of Commerce to continue supplying memory chips for Huawei, a move that analysts said is for their own benefit instead of doing a ""favor"" for Huawei, as the loss of such a big customer would also mean big losses for them.As the US chip ban draws near, it's not only a difficult time for Huawei; firms along the whole industry chain around the world are now facing a difficult time and some may struggle to survive.""No one wants to lose a big customer like Huawei. Suppliers of the Chinese tech giant have either customized production lines for Huawei or set up plants in China to supply the firm,"" an industry insider, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Global Times on Thursday.""To some extent, it's a 'ban' for all Huawei's suppliers, including Samsung and SK Hynix,"" the person said.Following a string of restrictions implemented since last year, the US in August announced a tightened ban on non-US companies from selling components to Huawei that were developed with US technology, and asking these companies to obtain special approval from the US if they want to continue to supply the Chinese firm.According to Korean news outlets, Samsung and SK Hynix will stop selling components to Huawei on September 15 if they cannot obtain a license.Samsung said it ""cannot comment on articles involving customers.""Sun Yuzhong, a researcher at the Institute of Computing Technology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday that the revenue of the two South Korean chip producers will drop a lot if they stop supplying Huawei.The two firms each earn about 10 trillion won ($8.4 billion) annually by supplying DRAM and NAND flash components to Huawei, local media reports said. The Chinese tech giant is reportedly one of Samsung's top-five sources of revenue.The South Korean companies certainly do not want to cut off the supply, but they are also worried that the Trump administration will pick on them, Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, told the Global Times on Thursday.""We all believe Huawei is in trouble, but we don't believe Huawei will fall. Because Huawei is one of the world's largest mobile phone manufacturers, if you lose this partner, what opportunities do you have to grow?"" said Xiang, adding that if the South Korean companies cut supplies for Huawei for a long time, they could lose the Chinese market altogether.So they hope to take this opportunity to regain market share by ""supporting"" Huawei, analysts said.The progress of the ban also ""depends on the US presidential election in November,"" said Xiang, noting that the sanction on Huawei is not a very clear law and regulation, but an executive order by the government.Huawei is still moving forward. On Thursday, it unveiled an updated HarmonyOS, its self-developed operating system, which is widely seen as an alternative to Google Android, and a direct response to the escalating US crackdown on its technology and supply chainMoreover, Huawei recorded shipments of 105 million smartphones in the first half of 2020, with total revenue of 255.8 billion yuan ($37.4 billion), said Richard Yu Chengdong, CEO of Huawei's consumer businesses.Most importantly, Huawei isn't sitting on its hands. The company is working with the government to build all the supply chain plants in China that Huawei needs to make parts for its products, a process that began when the company was first sanctioned by the US last year, experts said.Global Times "	9/10/20	0	0	-0.5881	-1

Photo:China Military After the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted intensive aerial and naval exercises near Taiwan for two consecutive days on Wednesday and Thursday, the military on the island is fearing a potential island encirclement patrol by the PLA's two aircraft carriers, Taiwan media said on Friday.Mainland analysts said on Friday that the PLA drills are normal training missions with the aim of honing the capabilities to win a war should one break out in the Taiwan Straits, and are responses and warnings to secessionist moves including drills that simulate a PLA attack and encouraging top US officials to visit the island.Multiple PLA warplanes including Su-30 fighter jets and Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft again entered the island's ""air defense identification zone"" off the ""airspace"" southwest to Taiwan on Thursday, after PLA Su-30 and J-10 fighter jets conducted similar missions on Wednesday, Taiwan media reported on Thursday, citing the island's defense authority.Taiwan's defense authority said that the Chinese mainland conducted an aerial and maritime joint exercise 90 nautical miles off the island's southwestern waters, in which a total of 21 warplanes of various types entered the island's ""air defense identification zone"" for 48 times. A mainland maritime research ship, which was seemingly on a reconnaissance mission, also appeared in the east side of the island, reports by Taiwan media said.The PLA drills are likely routine exercises aimed to enhance its actual combat capabilities in the Taiwan Straits by further learning the air, sea and land areas and honing skills, Chinese mainland military expert Song Zhongping told the Global Times.The PLA activities come at a time when the computer-aided war games phase of Taiwan's Han Kuang drills, which has the PLA in mind, are about to begin on Monday, Taiwan media reported.Also, some Taiwan media reported that Taiwan authorities are actively promoting the visit of US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to Taiwan and may invite Keith Krach, undersecretary of State for economic growth, energy, and the environment to the island.The recent PLA drills can serve as responses and warnings to the Taiwan secessionists and the US, showing that the PLA is capable and is becoming even more capable of reunifying the island by force if they go too far, a mainland military expert who asked not to be identified told the Global Times.Secessionists still cannot or do not want to recognize the huge gap in military strength between the island and the mainland, and with more live-fire and real-combat-oriented exercises, the PLA should put this reality for them to realize, the expert said.Citing speculation by an officer at the island's naval force, a separate Taiwan media report on Friday said the Taiwan military is preparing for the possibility that the Liaoning and the Shandong, the PLA's two aircraft carriers, could conduct joint exercises and encircle the island around September 22.Both PLA aircraft carriers were spotted carrying out training exercises in early September, with the Shandong in the Bohai Sea and the Liaoning in the Yellow Sea, as of September 3, foreign media reported at that time, citing commercial satellite images.The PLA or the mainland's Defense Ministry has not confirmed the reported aircraft carriers' movements.Mainland experts said that the two PLA carriers can play important roles in a potential reunification-by-force operation by attacking the island from different sides and intercepting possible US intervention.It is only a matter of time before the carriers sail pass the island of Taiwan, and it will become very normal, because if they are to enter the South China Sea or West Pacific from the Bohai Sea or Yellow Sea where they are based now, they will need to sail through the Taiwan Straits west to the Taiwan Island or the Miyako Strait and Bashi Channel east to the island, analysts said.The Shandong will eventually leave its shipyard in Northeast China and return to its home port in Sanya, South China's Hainan Province, during which it will likely pass the Taiwan Straits again, observers said.

"'Heroic' giant panda Lei Lei, mother of five, passes away at age 31nPhoto: CFP Legendary giant panda Lei Lei died at the age of 31 due to epileptic seizure on Wednesday, the China Giant Panda Conservation and Research Center announced on Thursday night through Sina Weibo.The center disclosed that Lei Lei had her first epileptic seizure in late June and its frequency increased in mid-August. Lei Lei could not do her exercise activities and became weaker since September, and had difficulties in eating without assistance from caretakers.Despite special treatment and care from veterinarians and keepers at the center, Lei Lei died from respiratory and circulatory failure caused by epileptic seizure.Lei Lei was found and rescued in 1992 from Liangshan Prefecture in Southwest China's Sichuan Province.

"Experts warn of grave consequences if US official visits TaiwannTaiwan Photo: Unsplash Some secessionist Taiwan media are once again drowning in joy by hyping the possible visit of US Undersecretary of State Keith Krach to the island, which would be a dangerous provocation that further harms the cross-Straits ties and regional stability.Local media once reported that the separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities in the island of Taiwan were actively promoting the visit of US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to Taiwan and may invite Krach to the island.Although the details of Krach's visit, which was unconfirmed and reportedly about an economic and commercial dialogue between the island and the US, have not been decided yet, Taiwan's economic department said that the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) will not be discussed during Krach's visit, without confirming his tour.Wang Mei-hua, head of Taiwan's economic governing body, said on Thursday that the subject of the meeting, exact time, and even the possibility of holding the dialogue online are unclear. Taiwan's ""foreign affairs"" authority gave a similar answer.If Krach's trip pushes through, he will be the most senior US official to visit the island in decades since US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar's visit last month, a few days before Taiwan lifted restrictions on importing ractopamine-enhanced pork from the US.Wang Jianmin, a Taiwan affairs expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday that the US senior official's possible visit is an attempt of the island's ""economic secessionism"" and gradual decoupling of Taiwan from the mainland under US interference.Some analysts said that besides grabbing financial benefits from Taiwan, Washington will guarantee nothing on security issues, as the island is just a little chess piece to confront the mainland. Once the situation turns around, Taiwan authorities will lose miserably.Wang said that if Taiwan continues provoking, the mainland will never rule out the option of ending the Cross-Straits Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA).For Americans who dare provoke China on the Taiwan question, some observers warned that their affiliated companies may have to stop doing business with the Chinese mainland and face sanctions.China will not give up anything on the issue of sovereignty. In view of continuous provocations, China will further warn and pressure the US and the island of Taiwan, so that they will realize the change in the situation, and think of the interests of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, Wang said.

"Omission of Chinese history in Taiwan textbooks opposed in islandnTaiwan Photo: Unsplash The omission of large periods of ancient Chinese history in new textbooks used by some schools in the island of Taiwan, which compress 2,400 years into four pages, is opposed by the majority of Taiwan residents, according to a local online poll. Analysts noted that the act serves as a ""soft"" method of the Democratic Progressive Party to promote its secessionist agenda by politicizing education.The textbooks introduce China's history from the most ancient period to the Tang Dynasty (618-907) in only 1,600 Chinese characters.Historic figures and classics are also largely left out and greater emphasis is put on cultural exchanges with foreign lands during the heyday of the Tang Dynasty, which Taiwan's local education bureau claimed was a way to cultivate ""world citizen ideologies,"" Taiwan media reported.In an online poll of 10,700 netizens, 66 percent voted ""strongly disagree"" or ""somewhat disagree"" with deleting large parts of Chinese history from the textbooks, Taiwan-based China Times reported.Taiwan residents expressed discontent on social media. One comment on Facebook read ""Just to be clear, the Chinese mainland is able to present the history of the rivalry between the KMT and the Communist Party of China with a neutral tone, while we [Taiwan] are still sparing no effort to wipe our blood relatives out of history textbooks.""Taiwan entertainer Teresa Hsu said on Facebook that politics should not disrupt education; students should receive proper education, otherwise they would lose competitiveness.""The Chinese mainland is emphasizing Chinese cultural identity while DPP authorities keep wiping it out. We are losing our roots and becoming cultural 'homeless' people,"" another Facebook user posted.DPP authorities are trying to push forward the party's secessionist agenda in a ""soft"" way, by undoing the cultural identity that links Taiwan with the Chinese mainland. Culture and education are political tools, Chang Ya-chung, a Taipei-based professor at National Taiwan University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.The island's history classes used to be classified into national and world history. During former Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui's time, history was taught in three sections: Taiwan history, Chinese history and world history. Now, the DPP has changed Chinese history into East Asian history, which is obviously an attempt to eliminate any Chinese elements in its education, Chang noted.The textbook is ""messy and incomprehensible, chaotic and fragmented"" in its aim to wipe out Chinese elements, observers said.The DPP is accelerating its de-sinicization process. Its new passport , which was just unveiled, highlights ""Taiwan"" on the cover, while the term ""Republic of China"" is minimized and hard to discern. "	9/9/20	0	1	0.1779	1
"PLA sorties in Taiwan Straits routine, not related to island missile test: expertsnA group of J-10 fighter jets attached to an aviation brigade of the air force under the PLA Southern Theater Command taxi in close formation on the flightline before takeoff for a flight training exercise under unfavorable meteorology conditions in mid August, 2020.Photo:China Military Multiple fighter jets of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) on Wednesday approached the island of Taiwan, the island's defense authority said, as Taiwan media said the PLA mission is the most intense this year, and speculated that it was aimed at ""disrupting"" the island's air defense missile test launch. The PLA warplane sorties were likely part of routine patrol and not necessarily related to the island's missile test, as the Taiwan missile is a very weak one that cannot concern the PLA as Taiwan media suggested, Chinese mainland military experts said on Wednesday. PLA warplanes, including the Su-30 and J-10, entered the ""aerial reflex zone"" southwest of Taiwan on Wednesday morning, Taiwan-based Liberty Times Net reported on Wednesday afternoon, citing a statement by the island's defense authority. A previous report by Liberty Times Net on Wednesday morning claimed that the military on the island made at least 24 radio broadcasts in an attempt to ""drive away"" the PLA aircraft, which flew from 1,500 meters to 9,000 meters high. This is the most number of times this year that the island had made such broadcasts, the report said, which also claimed the PLA likely meant to provoke the island's military over its scheduled missile launch test the same day. The report said the island planned to test-fire artillery and missiles with the highest trajectory altitude of ""infinite"" on Wednesday and Thursday, which led observers to believe the test featured the island's indigenous Tien Kung III air defense missile. Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the PLA sorties are likely part of routine and normal patrols, and are not necessarily related to the island's missile test. If the PLA sent Y-8 electronic reconnaissance aircraft, it can gather the Tien Kung III's electromagnetic signals, so the PLA can apply electromagnetic interference when needed. In this case, fighter jets like the Su-30s and J-10s are mainly used for combat patrol, Song said. The PLA needs to further familiarize itself with the air, sea and land areas to boost combat preparedness, he said. Citing a military enthusiast on the island of Taiwan, Taiwan media claimed the island's indigenous weapons are making the Chinese mainland ""uneasy,"" which led to the PLA sorties on Wednesday. Song said that Tien Kung III was based on the basic version of the US Patriot missile, and its reliability and combat capability are low. It is very questionable if it can function properly with strong electromagnetic interference. The missile's ability to intercept ballistic missiles is also very limited, Song said. In April and June, Taiwan tested the Tien Kung III twice, and both times ended in failure, Taiwan media reported. "	9/9/20	0	0	0.2516	1

"US sets Taiwan up as a 'human bomb': former vice chairman of Straits Exchange FoundationnFrom continuing to approve arms sales to Taiwan, to high-level officials visiting Taiwan, to sending warships and aircraft near the island, the US government frequently played the ""Taiwan card"" to hinder peace of the Taiwan Straits. Many are worried about the chances the Taiwan Straits will become the tipping point of a military conflict between China and the US.Dubbed a ""chess piece"" in the game, Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities have closely followed the US, seemingly oblivious to the threat of a war.Regarding current tensions, the Global Times reporter Bai Yunyi (GT) recently interviewed Chiu Chin-yi, former vice chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF). Chiu, 83, was one of the main forces in Taiwan's negotiations for the ""Wang-Koo talks"" in 1992, leading to a consensus in cross-Straits relations. Chiu Chin-yi, former vice chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation Photo: cnsphotos Worse than 1996 crisis 'October surprise' If the situation in the Taiwan Straits is compared to a poker game, in 1996 it was the Chinese mainland and Taiwan that played the cards and the US was initially a bystander. While the US later sent two aircraft carrier groups to the Far East to help Taiwan, it was still the Chinese mainland and Taiwan that played the cards. But the situation in 2020 is quite different from that time. Now it is the US playing its cards and the Chinese mainland responding to its cards, while Taiwan is a ""human bomb"" rushing forward regardless of costs.After Tsai Ing-wen's inaugural speech in 2016, which the mainland considered as an ""unfinished answer sheet,"" the official cross-Straits exchanges were almost suspended and Taiwan authorities [were] increasingly looking to the US for support. On the US side, after Trump took office, he did things in a way that often went against the rules which almost disturbed the entire existing international order. Over the past four years, the Trump administration has increasingly positioned China as a strategic competitor, aiming to contain China's rise. Therefore, when the Washington counts its bargaining chips against Beijing and Taiwan shows its desire to seek America's embrace, the Americans take it over gladly to play the ""Taiwan card.""That's why I said that the current situation is that Taiwan has been tied up as a ""human bomb"" by the US. The US now tests the mainland's strategic determination together with the Taiwan. Under the current situation, the two sides facing each other are the two ""nuclear powers,"" which are different from the rivalry between the mainland and Taiwan. Therefore, the situation is much more dangerous and difficult to control than in the past.My view is that the presidential election in the US is so intense right now that many scholars think Donald Trump would possibly stage an ""October surprise."" As far as the current situation is concerned, his ""October surprise"" is most likely to create some kind of armed conflicts to arouse American people's patriotism.On the Korean Peninsula, the US is unlikely to do much now. In the South China Sea, it is too large for the US to make it a ""war zone."" But the Taiwan Straits seems to be a good option to the US. It can upset the mainland, but not cost the US a high price. After all, only the lives of Taiwan people will be sacrificed. That's why the US would put Taiwan on the front line as a ""human bomb"" to provoke the mainland. So this October is very dangerous.From the mainland's perspective, it must hope that the first battle will be the last. But the reality may be more complicated, and it may not be that easy. However, if the mainland fails to make ""the first war as the last,"" the situation would evolve to a point where immediate reunification cannot be achieved while there's no turning back in cross-Straits relations. In addition, the US will use this as an excuse to form anti-China coalitions in Asia, such as building an ""Asian version of NATO.""As a person who cares about cross-Straits relations, my personal advice is that both sides must not follow the steps of the ""political maniac"" like Trump. The mainland, for its part, should wait and decide its future strategy after the US election. This is also a test of the mainland's strategic focus. A Taiwan warship launches a US-made Harpoon missile during the annual ""Han Kuang"" military drill on July 15, 2020. Photo: AFP There are already many signs: the joint military exercises between the US and the island of Taiwan; the US has decided to sell heavy drones and strike missiles to Taiwan. These are all signs of crossing a red line. If the US is determined to contain China's rise, the most ruthless move is to restore the status before 1979, which is to re-sign the defense treaty with Taiwan and include it in the ""Asian version of NATO,"" or ask Taiwan's Kaohsiung and Keelung to be the ports of call for the US Seventh Fleet, or use Hualien as a base for US heavy bombers. The current situation showed that these possibilities should not be ruled out.Therefore, how to prevent the further deterioration of cross-Straits relations, and how to pull the island of Taiwan out of the embrace and the influence of the US, is a very important issue.As I said before, Taiwan has been tied up as a ""human bomb."" So, Taiwan itself should do something to ""defuse the bomb,"" and the mainland should also help Taiwan to ""remove the bomb.""I always believe that economy is the main principle, and Taiwan always needs economy to survive and the fact is that Taiwan enjoys a surplus of nearly $100 billion with the mainland every year. Based on my previous experience of negotiating with the mainland, it was never the case that if you make a step further then I take a step back. Goodwill must be accumulated by both sides. Perhaps in the current situation, a small step that we take may become a big step. A view of Taipei Photo: IC Vaccine cooperation As a person who has studied international politics for many years, I think it is absolutely impossible for the US to truly ""befriend Taiwan"" or ""protect Taiwan."" How could the Americans sacrifice the lives of their soldiers and spend a large amount of money in order to protect Taiwan people? But now as Washington has clearly regarded Beijing as a strategic competitor, and the Taiwan authorities threw themselves to the embrace of the US, it can be noticed that in every opinion poll on the island, 60 to 70 percent of people believe that the US will protect Taiwan. It's really ridiculous.On the other hand, I think Trump's analogy does not appropriately describe US strategy. Taiwan's strategic position is not just a ""pen tip."" From a strategic point of view, the US has always regarded Taiwan's position very seriously in the First island chain. If the US fleet and bombers have docking bases in Taiwan, the strategic situation in Asia will also change.So I have been calling on the mainland government and experts to attach importance to Taiwan's strategic position. In order to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, Taiwan is a place that must be acquired.In Taiwan, those who still say ""Wuhan pneumonia"" are either the radical ones, or those who promote the ideology. They never consider improving cross-Straits relations or solving problems with humanitarianism. Actually, whether we talk about ""Xiaoming"" (children of mainland-Taiwan couples left in the mainland because of the unfair entry ban of the Taiwan authority) or the mainland students, they are all friends and relatives to the Taiwan people. Why aren't they allowed to return to Taiwan? US Health Secretary Alex Azar walks out of a plane as he arrives at the Sungshan Airport in Taipei on August 9, 2020. Photo: AFP I do not think much attention should be paid to those people's speeches. We should think in a positive way: COVID-19 is a plague that both sides of the Straits are facing. Can we improve the cross-Straits cooperation through sharing vaccines? When a group of Taiwan people still say ""Wuhan pneumonia"" with a narrowed mind, the mainland has shown willingness to work with the island on vaccine development.This is a broad mindset shown to the Taiwan people and the world. Especially when Alex Azar, the US Health and Human Services Secretary, visited Taiwan, he only pushed Taiwan to import pork and beef from the US, but remained silent on vaccines. The comparison is obvious.Of course, I know that the mainland also has difficulties. But under such a circumstance, doing this (vaccine cooperation) would not lose anything, but earn the mainland a good reputation among the Taiwan people. In turn, they would urge the DPP to change their policies. "	9/8/20	0	0	0.9821	1

It was reported that Taiwan authorities are actively promoting the visit of US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to Taiwan and may invite Keith Krach, undersecretary of State for economic growth, energy, and the environment to the island.Taiwan authorities intend to advance those events, which is to rely on Washington's influence to boost its own standing. But will these events bring security to Taiwan DPP authorities? Will the US provide security guarantees to Taiwan? The answer is no. Taiwan is just a little chess piece in the hands of the Americans.

"Former member of Taiwan pop group becomes dentist in Southwest ChinanXu Junhao Photo: VCG A former member of a pop group in the island of Taiwan became a dentist following an accident and chose to open his clinic in Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan Province. His story has gone viral on Chinese social media recently, touching and inspiring netizens.40-year-old Xu Junhao has lived in Chengdu for 15 years. After accidentally injuring himself during a rehearsal in 2003, Xu decided on a change of direction with encouragement from his father. He joined the West China School of Stomatology at Sichuan University in 2004, which was the beginning of his Chengdu life.After graduating seven years later, Xu went to Germany to study stomatology further and finally got a master's diploma in 2015. ""I decided to return to Chengdu because I saw the economic development potential of the city,"" Xu told the Global Times, so the city became his starting point for creating a business.Xu's parents visited his clinic and agreed with his decision. ""I told them (from Taiwan to Chengdu) is just from one home to another for me,"" Xu said when interviewed by Sichuan Radio and Television.He said he likes the city as the people are amiable and the local government helps young people from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan to create businesses in the city with favorable policies.As he was educated both in the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, Xu noticed the difference between the two educational systems.""Taiwan's universities are more like the US style, while teachers in the universities of the Chinese mainland are strictly academic,"" Xu said.Xu's story touched and inspired many netizens in the Chinese mainland when it was reported on Sina Weibo. The related hashtag ""former idol singer in Taiwan is working as a dentist in Chengdu"" has been viewed over 600 million times as of Tuesday.""It is hard for an idol singer to put aside the past and find new goals and achievements. I respect him,"" one netizen commented on Sina Weibo.Some netizens welcomed him to live in Chengdu. ""My favorite is what he said 'from one home to another.' Chengdu is always home to you. Hope you can live happier and longer in the city,"" another netizen wrote.Xu said he was happy to see many netizens can be inspired by his story. Following the hit album Youth Yearbook his band released in 2003, Xu went viral online. The popularity changed his life a bit.More local residents heard about Xu's clinic after the recent reports about him and have called to make an appointment. ""The number of appointments is increasing, but I have to control the number to maintain high-quality treatment,"" Xu told the Global Times.""To be honest, I think I have never really left the entertainment industry,"" Xu said, adding that he still loves fitness and keeps an optimistic life attitude. ""I am still a star in my life."" "	9/8/20	0	0	0.9915	1
"Piano firms expect hit after Czech senate speaker's Taiwan visitnCzech Senate Speaker Milos Vystrcil waves upon his arrival at Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport. Photo: AFP Czech businesses will be hurt by deteriorating relations between China and the Czech Republic due to the provocation of the Czech senate speaker's visit to China's Taiwan in August. Experts said that the cancelation of piano orders by Chinese importers is a natural business response that may signal a broader impact.The remarks came after a Chinese piano trader canceled an order valued at $23.8 million from leading Czech piano producer Petrof amid bilateral tensions triggered by Czech senate speaker Milos Vystrcil's Taiwan visit, a blatant move that sparked a nationwide outcry in China, which is the second-largest export destination for Czech pianos.A manager of Fuda Music, a Beijing-based piano company and an official partner of Petrof, told the Global Times on Sunday that it temporarily suspended new orders to the Czech supplier in early September in light of the huge impact of the Czech official's visit.""We talked to Petrof about this and it fully understands our decision,"" the manager of Fuda Music surnamed Li said, and the decision to suspend the orders was the company's own.Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Andrej Babis said on Sunday that he would fight to prevent fallout for Czech companies, Reuters reported.A source at the China Musical Instrument Association, which is authorized by China's civil affairs ministry, told the Global Times that musical instruments are classified as light industrial products, which have elements of both manufacturing and culture.If political factors influence bilateral cultural cooperation and exchange, then trade involving musical instruments may also be affected, he said, and some high-end Czech piano brands may not be approved for use in cultural activities.It may take time to see the fallout, but there could be an impact on Czech-produced goods, including pianos, insiders said.Petrof is one of the largest piano makers in Europe, with production capacity of more than 2, 000 instruments a year, according to Li, who is one of the two Petrof importers in China.Li has done business with Petrof for more than a decade and has imported hundreds of fine pianos from the company every year, Li said. He decided to temporarily suspend orders in consideration of public sentiment and market responses""Czech senate speaker's action will have an impact on many great Czech companies and Chinese partners like us,"" Li said.Petrof had not responded to a request for comment by the Global Times as of press time.Data that the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Light Industrial Products and Arts-Crafts sent to the Global Times on Monday showed that imports of pianos from the Czech Republic fell 55.8 percent from January to July to $1.33 million. Logistics disruptions caused by the pandemic were among the reasons, experts said.China is the second-largest export market for Czech pianos - including automatic pianos, harpsichords and other keyboard stringed instruments - which took a share of 20 percent in 2019, after Germany's 23 percent, the UN Comtrade Database showed.Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a regular press conference on Thursday that the one-China policy is an important political basis of the development of China-Czech diplomatic ties.""We hope the Czech side can have a clear understanding of the damage he has caused to bilateral relations, and immediately take measures to eliminate the negative impact,"" said Hua.Czech President Milos Zeman said on Sunday that he has no understanding for the Czech senate speaker's trip to Taiwan and called his behavior ""boyish provocation,"" according to Xinhua News Agency.

Logistics disruptions caused by the pandemic were among the reasons, experts said.China is the second-largest export market for Czech pianos - including automatic pianos, harpsichords and other keyboard stringed instruments - which took a share of 20 percent in 2019, after Germany's 23 percent, the UN Comtrade Database showed.Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a regular press conference on Thursday that the one-China policy is an important political basis of the development of China-Czech diplomatic ties.""We hope the Czech side can have a clear understanding of the damage he has caused to bilateral relations, and immediately take measures to eliminate the negative impact,"" said Hua.Czech President Milos Zeman said on Sunday that he has no understanding for the Czech senate speaker's trip to Taiwan and called his behavior ""boyish provocation,"" according to Xinhua News Agency.

"Czech President slams senate leader's Taiwan trip, easing tensions with Chinese mainlandnCzech Senate Speaker Milos Vystrcil waves upon his arrival at Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport. Photo: AFP Czech Republic President Milos Zeman has slammed the visit to the island of Taiwan by the head of the Czech Senate Milos Vystrcil, calling it a ""boyish provocation."" Some analysts believe that the president is trying to defuse the political farce and reduce the impact on China-Czech ties.Vystrcil's six-day visit with a delegation of 90 people was not backed by the Czech government, which has always adhered to the one-China principle, especially after the incumbent Zeman administration took office in 2013.Vystrcil, who is a nobody on the stage of international affairs, quickly became the focus of attention last week after he stated, ""I am a Taiwanese"" in a speech during his high-profile visit to the island, echoing the late US President John F. Kennedy's cold war slogan in Berlin in 1963.Zeman on Sunday said on broadcaster Prima that Vystrcil's Taiwan tour was a ""boyish provocation,"" and he will now be excluded from meetings of the state's top foreign policy officials, Reuters reported.Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Andrej Babis said on Sunday that Vystrcil did not understand the bigger world and he will try to prevent losses for Czech firms, Czech media reported.Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during his visit in Germany on August 31 that anyone who challenges the one-China principle will pay a heavy price, referring to the Czech Senate speaker's Taiwan visit.Cui Hongjian, director of EU studies at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times that at the central administrative level, there will be no substantive exchanges between the Czech Republic and Taiwan. However, in the Czech parliament, anti-China statements and proposals related to Taiwan may appear, which will have an impact on overall relations.Some politicians from the Czech parliament have tried to challenge the government's foreign policy dominance by putting forward ideas and proposals that are inconsistent with the government's policies, said Cui, noting that these will make it more difficult for the Czech government when it comes to China-related issues and undermine the harmony of bilateral relations.Czech media reported Friday that the Czech piano manufacturer Petrof, which sells 35 percent of its products to China, lost a CZK 5.3 million ($237,000) deal from a Beijing-based customer, who cancelled the order as the deal was at risk of incurring a fine if China imposed sanctions against the Czech Republic.China wants its foreign policy to be holistic rather than acting in complete contradiction to what it says, Cui said.Many Czech companies operate in or export to China. Home Credit, which belongs to the richest Czech, Petr Kellner, is a major consumer lender in China. The Chinese mainland is also the biggest single market for Czech-based Skoda Auto, Reuters reported.In 2019, trade between the island of Taiwan and the Czech Republic only came to $800 million, while trade between the Chinese mainland and the Czech Republic totaled $29.3 billion, a 2.3 percent increase from the previous year.

"Prague must show goodwill to mend market confidencenA view of the empty Old Town Square in Prague, the Czech Republic Photo: Xinhua According to media reports, Zuzana Ceralová Petrofová, president of Czech piano maker Petrof, said a customer in Beijing just canceled an order on the grounds that Czech Senate Speaker Milos Vystrcil's recent visit to Taipei city had severely disrupted a normal China-Czech relationship. The cancellation has attracted rising attention among Chinese netizens as some began to suggest it was Beijing's ""retaliation"" against the Czech Republic.While information and explanation from the specific Chinese buyer are still unavailable, if the company did cancel the order due to the Czech politician's visit that seriously trampled on the one-China principle, it still should be seen as an individual move by an individual business.After all, the order, at the price tag of merely 5 million Czech koruna ($220,000), is too small to be a credible sign of retaliation by China's government.Nevertheless, even if the cancellation is not an action directed by Beijing or the news itself turns out to be false or a misunderstanding, it still underlines simmering market concerns below the surface that relations between China and the Czech Republic have encountered a serious problem that will cause a wide range of consequences in many areas in the coming months.Anyone who has a basic understanding of China's national conditions is certainly aware of the one-China principle. So Vystrcil's visit to Taipei city constituted a serious infringement on China's national sovereignty, undermining the foundation of the bilateral relations.And it is not hard to conceive how the loss of market confidence would affect economic activities, an annoying disruption to otherwise smooth trade and investment plans.Both countries have seen bilateral economic ties strengthen over the years, particularly since the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative, with China seen as increasingly important for the Czech Republic's foreign trade. Statistics showed that in 2019, bilateral trade grew to $29.3 billion, accounting for 7.8 percent of the Czech Republic's total trade.Moreover, an increasing number of Chinese companies have come to make investment in the Czech Republic, which has already become an important window for Chinese investment in Europe. It would be regrettable to see such momentum of cooperation affected by a politically malicious move.It may be an undeniable fact that there are different views and voices toward some China-related issues in the Czech Republic, which is why the Czech government officially honors the one-China principle, but Vystrcil's right-wing opposition party may not.However, even if the Taiwan visit is only an individual action by a particular flamboyant politician, the Chinese market may not bother to distinguish whether their trading partners are on the friendly side or the hostile side.Politicians that made the reckless provocation against a country's sovereignty should take responsibility for all the consequences.In the meantime, we also hope the Czech government can show more kindness to eliminate the negative impact of this unpleasant incident on bilateral relations as soon as possible.

"Huawei to launch phone with Kirin 9000 chips, despite supply issuenHuawei store Photo:VCG Huawei plans to launch its smartphone equipped with Kirin 9000 smartphone chips in ""limited numbers,"" a Huawei executive said on Saturday after the tech giant's Taiwan-based chip supplier said it will halt shipments to Huawei after September 14 to comply with US sanctions, which raised concerns over the company's smartphone business.The statement from Richard Yu Chengdong, chief executive of Huawei's consumer business group, indicates a tentative plan for the Shenzhen-based tech giant which has been targeted by intensifying US crackdowns.However, Yu was also straightforward about the difficulty the company faces in securing chip supplies.""It's a lesson for Chinese companies that only focus on design in the process of globalization. Now the only problem we face is production, as Huawei can't produce the chips by itself,"" Yu said, new.qq.com reported on Saturday.Yu's statement came after Taiwan-based TSMC, the supplier of Kirin 9000 chips, confirmed that it will stop shipping semiconductors to Huawei after September 14 to comply with US sanctions on Huawei.Earlier this year, the US government put Huawei on its Entity List, which requires US companies to obtain a license to export domestically produced chips and software. Huawei. Photo: VCG RELATED ARTICLES: Huawei could use local chips after US ban The Trump administration has recently moved to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei Technologies from global chipmakers.This has also raised concerns that Huawei may be forced to reduce, or even stop selling its high-end mobile phones like Mate 40. Yu also disclosed earlier that Huawei's Mate 40 series will be its last smartphone to use Kirin chips.""I wouldn't not say that the matter is settled, because the China-US political situation might change after the US presidential election, and it's possible that the US will change its policies toward China and Huawei,"" Xiang Ligang, an independent telecom analyst, told the Global Times on Saturday.Xiang also noted that while Chinese chip manufacturers don't currently produce high-end 5nm or 7nm chips, it does not mean they won't be able to manufacture them in the future.According to Xiang, a couple of Chinese companies are already producing 14nm chips which are often used in medium-level mobile phones.""The reason they don't produce the high-end 5nm or 7nm chips is likely due to customer shortage, not a technological gap. Of course, they need to invest a lot of capital to upgrade their existing technologies but it's not like a mission impossible for Chinese chipmakers,"" Xiang said, predicting that Huawei might resort to Chinese suppliers in the face of the US crackdown.Global Times "	9/5/20	0	0	-0.6428	-1
"Taiwan's attempt to restructure global supply chains with the US won't work: analystsnTaiwan Photo: Unsplash The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and Taiwan's Representative Office in the US on Friday said the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the risks of relying too much on a single country or supplier for critical materials.The two made a joint statement, encouraging partners to bring supply chains closer to home or like-minded economies.But analysts said that the island of Taiwan's attempt to restructure global supply chains with the US will not work, as it doesn't make sense from an economic standpoint. And Taiwan is angling for political gain.Taiwan and the US-Taiwan Business Council (USTBC) held a virtual discussion on enhancing the supply chain between the US and the island of Taiwan on Wednesday. A woman works at a factory of the Harbin Dongan Automotive Engine Manufacturing Co., Ltd in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, March 10, 2020.Photo:Xinhua Taiwan plays a key role in the technology supply chain for US companies, given its global importance in the semiconductor sector, and as a hub for cutting-edge semiconductor production, USTBC said.""Taiwan doesn't have enough capacity to meet global demand. The real purpose of Taiwan is to highlight its unique position in the industrial chain, because it does have some technological advantages,"" Hu Qimu, a senior fellow at the Sinosteel Economic Research Institute, told the Global Times on Friday.Hsiao Bi-khim, a member of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party, said during the discussion that Taiwan and the US should strengthen cooperation on the supply chain, as the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted many economies to re-examine the issue of supply chain security, media reported.""Taiwan's aim is neither the security of the industrial chain, nor its economic development and employment creation. It is trying to improve its international political status, and receive more orders from the restructuring of the global supply chain,"" Hu said.Analysts noted that the kind of restructuring Taiwan wishes will not happen as big shifts in global supply chains are impossible because they have nowhere to go.China accounts for 25 percent of the world's manufacturing output, and overtook the US in 2010, according to World Bank data.Of the Fortune 1,000 companies, 163 have primary suppliers and 938 have secondary suppliers on the mainland, according to a Dun & Bradstreet report.""People talk about the supply chain shifting outside the Chinese mainland. We don't see this happening. In reality, it's simply not happening,"" Denis Depoux,Global Managing Director of Roland Berger, told the Global Times.Due to the impact of COVID-19 this year and in the next few years, in a world which is depressed with no growth or even recession, with all the capacity versus flattering demand, with a high competition price war, there's very little room to maneuver to invest in a new supply chain, Depoux added.After tensions escalated between China and the US, many US and European companies have dealt with factories outside China to avoid the possible risks of a US ban. But people found that the ""spare tires"" in ASEAN, especially Vietnam, are mostly subsidiaries of Chinese enterprises, Hu said.Analysts said that moving the industrial chains is not as simple as moving and rebuilding factories.The Japanese government in April offered incentives to its companies to relocate their overseas operations back to Japan. But the subsidies, some 243.5 billion yen ($2.29 billion), represented only 60 percent of Japan's $3.81 billion investment in China in 2018.The US has also released support policies to bring businesses back to the US. But according to a survey last year, 87 percent of US businesses in China had not relocated supply chains away from China, and had no immediate plans to do so under the Trump administration's relocation policyMore than 75 percent of US businesses said they are doing better or as well in China compared to overall global operations, a recent US-China Business Council report said.""I don't really believe in the offshoring or the reshoring of some industries from China back to Europe or the US, because it doesn't make sense from an economic standpoint,"" Depoux noted.There's a good reason why something is sourced from China or from other countries--it's simply because there are capabilities. The shift of the supply chain from China to ASEAN, for instance, has started already, which was not related to the trade war, the latest US measures, or the COVID-19 crisis. It started simply for cost competitiveness reasons - globalization at work, Depoux noted.""For 10 years, Chinese industries have been moving to the ASEAN region. Low-end labor-intensive industries have been exported, but real Chinese manufacturing has remained in China. At present, the infrastructure, manufacturing process and labor quality of ASEAN cannot meet the requirements of replacing China's high-tech manufacturing industry,"" Hu noted. "	9/4/20	0	0	0.431	1
"India underrates China's will to defend every inch of territorynChina India Photo: GT India's latest military provocations on the China-India border are very different to that of the Doklam stand-off in 2017, as it dispatched more troops and displayed an extremely aggressive posture with Chinese experts saying on Thursday that Indian decision-makers have seemingly underestimated China's determination to protect its sovereignty.Chinese analysts said New Delhi might believe that China is facing heavy pressure from the US and focusing on handling tensions on its eastern side, such as in the Taiwan Straits and the South China Sea, so it assumes that it would be a good chance for India to push forward and force China to make a compromise.If it succeeds, this would be a remarkable achievement for New Delhi to show off to its people and distract attention from the severe domestic COVID-19 epidemic and worsening economic situation, analysts said.India's military activities have become increasingly aggressive in recent days, and border tensions see no sign of de-escalating.The Indian Army has changed its posture from border management to securing the border on the 1,597 km Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, after the People's Liberation Army (PLA) added a military deployment in the region, the Hindustan Times reported on Thursday.India also deployed additional specialized forces such as the Special Frontier Force, and the Indian media said its soldiers have occupied ""key peaks on the southern bank of Pangong Lake."" The Indian Army has paid special attention by deploying a combat group (a mix of armored and mechanized elements) on the Depsang Plains, according to the Hindustan Times.Indian Army Chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane has visited Leh, the largest town of Ladakh in India, to the west of Pangong Tso Lake, on Thursday amid the ongoing face-off, according to Indian media NDTV.Indian media also reported in August that the Indian Army also gets ready for a long winter haul in Ladakh.These high-profile activities showed that the Indian military and its government leaders are extremely sure of themselves, and even more sure than in the Doklam stand-off in 2017, and China must prepare for long-term tensions on the border, but if Indian troops invade Chinese territory and attack Chinese troops, no matter what kind of pressure China is facing to the east, India will surely pay a heavy price, said Chinese analysts.Lin Minwang, deputy director at the Center for South Asian Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times that India still wants to negotiate rather than start a war, and its aggressive military activities are serving their purpose of keeping the border situation tense and forcing China to compromise, but it seems like they don't understand why China won't accept India's claims.China and India have different claims along the LAC, and the recent provocations prove that India wants to gain more unrealistic concessions from China, Lin said, noting that through a series of negotiations after the conflict on June 15 causing casualties on both sides, Chinese and Indian soldiers have disengaged in some regions such as the Galwan River valley, but India still wants Chinese troops to retreat from more regions like Pangong Tso Lake and Reqin Mountain to accept the ""LAC"" drawn by the Indian side.""This is totally unfair and overcharged,"" and if China accepts these claims and pulls back its troops from its own territory under military pressure from India, Indian troops would keep pressing forward and its provocations and aggressive posture would be endless, so that's why China is furious this time and refuses to make any compromises, said Lin.India's aggressive actions are making the tensions difficult to de-escalate and be resolved. When Indian troops illegally crossed the LAC on Monday, the Indian army, which first moved to accuse China of carrying out ""provocative military movements,"" said it ""had pre-empted Chinese military activity"" in a statement.The Indian army's statement fully proves that it was first to illegally cross the border in an act of provocation, the first to unilaterally change the status quo in the border area, and the first to violate the important consensus reached by the two sides, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said on Wednesday As the situation of India's internal coronavirus epidemic takes a turn for the worse, and its economy is experiencing an unprecedented recession, India is expecting its aggressive behavior to draw support from the US, since it's actively engaging in the US-proposed Indo-Pacific strategy, but this could prove to be a huge mistake with Chinese retaliation possible, Chinese analysts warned.According to the Johns Hopkins University on Thursday, India has got 3,853,406 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 67,376 deaths.Data from the Indian government on Monday showed that its economy, which was among the fastest-growing economies just a couple of years ago, contracted by 23.9 percent in the April-June quarter, its steepest fall on record and the worst performance among major economies.Before the latest tensions on the border, India has launched a series of unfair and nationalist sanctions against Chinese firms and banned apps in India, and China didn't retaliate, so this could make Indian leaders believe that China will not retaliate either if they create more provocations on the border, said Lin.Chinese experts said the border issue is about sovereignty which is totally different from the economy and trade, and on economic issues, China's can regard India's nationalist measures as unnecessary and pointless due to the Indian economy being too weak to be retaliated against by China, but regarding sovereignty, China will never compromise and India's miscalculations will endanger its frontline troops.Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times that the reason why PLA troops are being restrained is that China still hopes tensions could be de-escalated and it doesn't wish to create a new conflict that would harm overall relations between the two sides, rather than being purely afraid of Indian aggression.""Chinese military forces, whether the army or air force, in the region are well-trained and their weapons have technological advantages over India's. They are fully capable of cracking down against any Indian provocation at anytime if Indian troops invade,"" Song noted.China normally plans for the long-term when making decisions and any provocation from other countries ""will be put on record in an account book,"" just like the conflict of 1962, and back then, India had started its aggressive behavior from 1959. But once the international situation was suitable for China to strike back, the PLA would take action and destroy Indian troops before New Delhi realized what had happened, said a Chinese military expert who requested anonymity.In a recent survey made by the Global Times and the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, 89.1 percent of participants support military retaliation if India again launched a border conflict, and 50.4 percent of them ""strongly support"" self-defense and counter-attacks by force, while 38.7 percent of them only ""relatively support"" it.

"Pentagon won’t sacrifice soldiers for non-core US interestsnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT The Pentagon's annual report on ""Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China,"" released on Tuesday illustrates an overview of military imbalance in the Taiwan Straits. It warns that the People's Liberation Army is preparing to unify the island of Taiwan with the Chinese mainland by force, listing a range of China's military options to ""invade"" the island.The part was certainly not choreographed for the sake of Taiwan. It aims solely at China. The report coordinates with US President Donald Trump administration's China policy, providing excuses for Washington's tough strategy against Beijing.This is a tacit Trump re-election tactic. The November elections are just around the corner. And the two presidential candidates are competing over who can be tougher on China. Trump needs Pentagon papers like this to magnify his macho rhetoric against China.On the surface, the US has shown no intention to abandon the Three Joint Communiqués between the two countries, in which the US formally acknowledges there is only one China. However, quite a few of US words and deeds have already violated the one-China principle.The Chinese side has already made clear: The day that a US Navy vessel arrives in Kaohsiung, Taiwan is the day that the PLA unifies Taiwan with military force. The US is well aware that neither military cooperation nor increasing arms sales will help the island withstand possible military strikes from the Chinese mainland. It simply believes that Taiwan is an easy card to play. It is therefore creating new legislations from time to time in an attempt to make the communiqués a mere ornament.Washington has not publicly overthrown the one-China principle, because it does not wish to confront China militarily. Essentially, the US wants to deliver a message through hyping up the Taiwan question - the US is much stronger than China; it will do whatever it wants to; China is not capable to make the US behave; and Washington has a lot of ways to make Beijing uncomfortable.The truth by constantly drawing the Taiwan card shows the White House has no other ace or joker up its sleeve. Washington has already exploited the human rights issue. Phase one trade deal was signed. Trump has no more energy to begin new negotiations over the phase two deal—because this will surely be much more difficult than the first one. He does not have time to win any advantage whatsoever to seek reelection points from economic issues. Therefore, the Taiwan question is the only card left and convenient to play.Yet it is believed that Trump knows the bottom line. He cannot provoke a hot war with China. Otherwise, he will not find any support from American public. As a businessman, he could be construed as good at calculating the cost of whatever choice he makes. The US failed to achieve its desired results even in Iraq and Afghanistan after all these years of constantly sending US troops there, what possible result could it get from fighting a hot war against China?Compared with politicians in the White House, the Pentagon must be far more cautious. The US front-line command system, such as the Indo-Pacific Command, is even more careful to avoid danger — especially a face-to-face conflict with a powerful rival. Granted, there are orders from the White House that the US military has to obey. But they will find ways to influence Washington's decision to prevent situation spiraling out of control.Take the Taiwan question. If asked, the Pentagon can coordinate with the White House to stage a stunt. Yet if asked to fight in a real war, the Pentagon will doubtlessly emphasize possible, dreadful consequences.The Pentagon has long hoped to put any scenario of confrontation with China into a controllable scope. Politicians are prone to have verbal diarrhea at any time. But soldiers fear misjudgment the most. The least thing they want is to stumble into a war. Because it will be the soldiers, not politicians, who will sacrifice first.In terms of Taiwan questions, why would the Pentagon be willing to sacrifice American soldiers' lives for something that is certainly not the core interest of the US?The author is a research fellow at the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	9/3/20	1	1	0.8267	1
"Taiwan military's 'overreaction' to report shows it's 'guilty': Beijing think tanknPhoto: The South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative The island of Taiwan on Wednesday said a Beijing think tank report on Sunday which claims a US military aircraft may have taken off from a Taiwan-based airfield and flew to Japan was fake news. This is the third time that the Taiwan military authority has responded to the report by the think tank, which recently gained prominence for closely tracking US military activities in the Taiwan Straits.In an exclusive interview with the Global Times, the head of the think tank stressed that the Taiwan authorities' ""grand treatment"" of the report was an overreaction and only causes suspicion from the outside world.""We have not published false information, but have reasonable suspicion based on open source ADS-B and remote sensing data, which can be restored and retraced on the international platform. We welcome the island's response, but hope it can come up with more details and evidence to prove that there is no such thing,"" Hu Bo, director of the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI) - the think tank - told the Global Times on Wednesday.The SCSPI has regularly tracked the activities of US ships and aircraft surrouding Taiwan island, which has concerned the Taiwan military authority.An EP-3E reconnaissance aircraft was spotted in the northern ""airspace"" of Taiwan and flew to Japan over the East China Sea on Sunday. This unusual flight path showed that the aircraft potentially took off from an airport on the island, according to information released by the SCSPI's website.However, the SCSPI also said that the unusual flight path of the US military aircraft could have been caused by signal errors. On Monday night, the Taiwan military called the news ""false information, completely against the facts, and seriously undermined regional security and stability.""On Tuesday, the think tank said that by comparing remote sensing satellite images, it was suspected that the US guided missile destroyer USS Halsey was found in the Penghu area. If confirmed, this will be the first time a US warship has been found sailing in Taiwan's ""internal waters"" while crossing the Taiwan Straits. This also further provokes the Chinese mainland.On the same night, the Taiwan navy authority said the information was deliberately fabricated, and called on Taiwan media not to quote it. Prior to this, Taiwan's defense auhthority took the initiative to announce that a US Navy destroyer crossed the Taiwan Straits on Monday.This is the ninth time a US warship has crossed the Taiwan Straits this year. A spokesperson for the US Navy's Seventh Fleet said that the USS Halsey passes through the Taiwan Straits on a regular basis.On Wednesday, Taiwan's ""Ministry of National Defense"" held a press conference to explain the ""fake information"" recently released by the SCSPI. ""Deputy minister"" Chang Che-ping declared, ""The content is fictitious or fish eyes,"" adding that the Chinese mainland intends to use this platform to release false information, and to attract international attention through media reports.Hu said he saw the comments made by Taiwan's defense authority, and welcomed the response, as it proves that the island attaches great importance to the matter.""The island's response is subjective, and I hope for more rational voices. More detailed information is welcome to prove that everything is fine,"" Hu said, noting that the SCSPI will continue to publish sea and air conditions around Taiwan to dispel doubts and speculation.Hu said the think tank has established its own sea and air situation system for research to continuously track and disclose the dynamics of ships and aircraft in the South China Sea. The think tank tracking relies on the domestic and foreign shared ship tracking identification system (AIS), and broadcast automatic surveillance system (ADS-B). The information of these two systems is open source commercial data, and there are many ways to obtain it.""The information we publish is not manufactured. It can be restored on an authoritative international platform. When the information is released, we make reasonable analysis and do not draw a conclusion,"" Hu told the Global Times.Hu said that ""we welcome the Taiwan authority to provide more evidence to show that all the abnormalities did not happen, which would also delight us.""As for the landing of the EP-3E reconnaissance aircraft, Hu further explained that surveillance shows the situation around the island of Taiwan is complicated, with abnormal activities of US military aircraft. But he admitted that they cannot conclude based on public surveillance. There are three possibilities: one is misleading information, as the ASD-B system may show turbulence, like GPS; the second would be that the US military made a false signal to distort surveillance from the mainland; and the third, the report is true, Hu said, noting that is why the institute marked ""suspected"" in its published information.As for the entry of the USS Halsey in the internal waters of Taiwan, Hu said the image comes from the US-based Planet company, which is commercially available. Data of the ship's width and length matches a Burke-class destroyer, and the USS Halsey happened to sail across the Taiwan Straits. The location was made by a satellite image, so deviation exists, but the error could be small.""Of course, based solely on a three-meter satellite image resolution ratio to identify a 10,000-ton level destroyer is difficult, and more evidence is needed, and that's why we marked it as 'suspected,'"" Hu said.Hu believes Taiwan overly reacted to the report published by the think tank, and such ""grand treatment"" actually sparked suspicion from the outside world. ""We just described the facts when we published our data, to back our doubts and not to stir conflicts in the Straits,"" Hu said. He noted that Taiwan's reaction shows there's something fishy. ""If they keep a necessary distance with the US, will they be afraid to discuss it?""""Will Taiwan still be nervous if they distance themselves from the US?"" asked Hu, saying that his think tank will keep publishing relevant information and provide objective analysis. ""We'd like to get feedbacks from Taiwan, but we hope they are rational ones, with more details and evidence, instead of baseless subjective conclusions."" "	9/2/20	0	0	0.9237	1
"DPP secessionists ‘deceive themselves’ with new passportnTaiwan Photo: Unsplash With growing tensions and the specter of a military conflict looming over the Taiwan Straits, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-dominated Taiwan island unveiled a new version of its passport, marked by further de-sinicization. Experts from the Chinese mainland and Taiwan believe the DPP's ""political smuggling"" is pushing the island toward the brink of a military conflict.Taiwan's executive authority unveiled the new passport on Wednesday, which highlighted ""Taiwan"" on the cover, while the term ""Republic of China"" was minimized, fitting into a concentric circle that encloses the ""national emblem.""The DPP authority claimed that the COVID-19 pandemic is the reason for the revision, saying many residents from Taiwan felt inconvenienced while traveling, as their passport was mistaken for the mainland's. The rhetoric is similar to the one 17 years ago, when the Chen Shui-bian-led DPP authority in 2003 added ""Taiwan"" to the passport cover for the first time.The fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China will not change no matter what tricks the DPP plays, Hua Chunying, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said in a briefing Wednesday.In July, the legislative body of Taiwan passed a proposal drafted by secessionists, to emphasize ""Taiwan"" over ""China"" on both China Airlines and the passport. Chinese experts from the mainland and Taiwan consider the move politically provocative, which pushes ""Taiwan secessionism.""Chang Ya-chung, a Taipei-based professor, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the DPP authority cannot and dares not claim ""de jure Taiwan independence,"" and only promotes secessionism through various moves.Backed by the US, the DPP authority continues to challenge the mainland's bottom line. Chang said the Tsai Ing-wen authority does not have the ability to ""say no"" to US.

"Foxconn launches mass recruitment to fill gap left by seasonal workersnWorkers are seen at a workshop in Longhua science and technology park of Foxconn Technology Group in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Province, Feb 22, 2019. (Xinhua/Mao Siqian) Taiwan-based semiconductor supplier Foxconn has been launching mass recruitment as some factory job vacancies extended up to 20,000, partially due to seasonal workers returning to school after the summer holiday, an insider said.This came as rumors spread online suggesting that there were many workers eager to quit their jobs at some of the firm's plants, partly due to lower-than-expected payment.Foxconn denied the allegation when reached by the Global Times on Wednesday, saying the news was made up by certain netizens and is false.Foxconn offers a salary that is considered relatively high in the labor-intensive industry, with monthly income of up to 8,000 yuan ($1,150), analysts said. However, people quitting their jobs happens from time to time as does large-scale recruitment among almost all factories.A source at the recruitment center for Foxconn's factory in Shenzhen, South China's Guangdong Province, said on Wednesday that people leaving their jobs is normal at this time of the year, as some workers go back to school after the summer holiday.""There are a lot of vacancies now and we recruit as many as there are,"" the person said, noting that there is a shortage of about 20,000 staff for the positions including making mobile phones and tablets for Apple and Huawei.To fill the gap, the bonus offered is better than usual, with regular workers now getting a bonus of 4,000 yuan in addition to monthly salaries after three months of work, the source said.Foxconn has often been exposed under spotlight. A recent media report alleged that semiconductor suppliers for Apple including Foxconn are planning to move their global supply chains out of China and into Mexico, which the company later refuted.

"Taiwan military's 'overreaction' to report shows it's 'guilty': Beijing think tanknPhoto: The South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative The island of Taiwan on Wednesday said a Beijing think tank report on Sunday which claims a US military aircraft may have taken off from a Taiwan-based airfield and flew to Japan was fake news. This is the third time that the Taiwan military authority has responded to the report by the think tank, which recently gained prominence for closely tracking US military activities in the Taiwan Straits.In an exclusive interview with the Global Times, the head of the think tank stressed that the Taiwan authorities' ""grand treatment"" of the report was an overreaction and only causes suspicion from the outside world.""We have not published false information, but have reasonable suspicion based on open source ADS-B and remote sensing data, which can be restored and retraced on the international platform. We welcome the island's response, but hope it can come up with more details and evidence to prove that there is no such thing,"" Hu Bo, director of the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI) - the think tank - told the Global Times on Wednesday.The SCSPI has regularly tracked the activities of US ships and aircraft surrouding Taiwan island, which has concerned the Taiwan military authority.An EP-3E reconnaissance aircraft was spotted in the northern ""airspace"" of Taiwan and flew to Japan over the East China Sea on Sunday. This unusual flight path showed that the aircraft potentially took off from an airport on the island, according to information released by the SCSPI's website.However, the SCSPI also said that the unusual flight path of the US military aircraft could have been caused by signal errors. On Monday night, the Taiwan military called the news ""false information, completely against the facts, and seriously undermined regional security and stability.""On Tuesday, the think tank said that by comparing remote sensing satellite images, it was suspected that the US guided missile destroyer USS Halsey was found in the Penghu area. If confirmed, this will be the first time a US warship has been found sailing in Taiwan's ""internal waters"" while crossing the Taiwan Straits. This also further provokes the Chinese mainland.On the same night, the Taiwan navy authority said the information was deliberately fabricated, and called on Taiwan media not to quote it. Prior to this, Taiwan's defense auhthority took the initiative to announce that a US Navy destroyer crossed the Taiwan Straits on Monday.This is the ninth time a US warship has crossed the Taiwan Straits this year. A spokesperson for the US Navy's Seventh Fleet said that the USS Halsey passes through the Taiwan Straits on a regular basis.On Wednesday, Taiwan's ""Ministry of National Defense"" held a press conference to explain the ""fake information"" recently released by the SCSPI. ""Deputy minister"" Chang Che-ping declared, ""The content is fictitious or fish eyes,"" adding that the Chinese mainland intends to use this platform to release false information, and to attract international attention through media reports.Hu said he saw the comments made by Taiwan's defense authority, and welcomed the response, as it proves that the island attaches great importance to the matter.""The island's response is subjective, and I hope for more rational voices. More detailed information is welcome to prove that everything is fine,"" Hu said, noting that the SCSPI will continue to publish sea and air conditions around Taiwan to dispel doubts and speculation.Hu said the think tank has established its own sea and air situation system for research to continuously track and disclose the dynamics of ships and aircraft in the South China Sea. The think tank tracking relies on the domestic and foreign shared ship tracking identification system (AIS), and broadcast automatic surveillance system (ADS-B). The information of these two systems is open source commercial data, and there are many ways to obtain it.""The information we publish is not manufactured. It can be restored on an authoritative international platform. When the information is released, we make reasonable analysis and do not draw a conclusion,"" Hu told the Global Times.Hu said that ""we welcome the Taiwan authority to provide more evidence to show that all the abnormalities did not happen, which would also delight us.""As for the landing of the EP-3E reconnaissance aircraft, Hu further explained that surveillance shows the situation around the island of Taiwan is complicated, with abnormal activities of US military aircraft. But he admitted that they cannot conclude based on public surveillance. There are three possibilities: one is misleading information, as the ASD-B system may show turbulence, like GPS; the second would be that the US military made a false signal to distort surveillance from the mainland; and the third, the report is true, Hu said, noting that is why the institute marked ""suspected"" in its published information.As for the entry of the USS Halsey in the internal waters of Taiwan, Hu said the image comes from the US-based Planet company, which is commercially available. Data of the ship's width and length matches a Burke-class destroyer, and the USS Halsey happened to sail across the Taiwan Straits. The location was made by a satellite image, so deviation exists, but the error could be small.""Of course, based solely on a three-meter satellite image resolution ratio to identify a 10,000-ton level destroyer is difficult, and more evidence is needed, and that's why we marked it as 'suspected,'"" Hu said.Hu believes Taiwan overly reacted to the report published by the think tank, and such ""grand treatment"" actually sparked suspicion from the outside world. ""We just described the facts when we published our data, to back our doubts and not to stir conflicts in the Straits,"" Hu said. He noted that Taiwan's reaction shows there's something fishy. ""If they keep a necessary distance with the US, will they be afraid to discuss it?""""Will Taiwan still be nervous if they distance themselves from the US?"" asked Hu, saying that his think tank will keep publishing relevant information and provide objective analysis. ""We'd like to get feedbacks from Taiwan, but we hope they are rational ones, with more details and evidence, instead of baseless subjective conclusions."" "	9/2/20	0	0	0.9237	1
"DPP secessionists ‘deceive themselves’ with new passportnTaiwan Photo: Unsplash With growing tensions and the specter of a military conflict looming over the Taiwan Straits, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-dominated Taiwan island unveiled a new version of its passport, marked by further de-sinicization. Experts from the Chinese mainland and Taiwan believe the DPP's ""political smuggling"" is pushing the island toward the brink of a military conflict.Taiwan's executive authority unveiled the new passport on Wednesday, which highlighted ""Taiwan"" on the cover, while the term ""Republic of China"" was minimized, fitting into a concentric circle that encloses the ""national emblem.""The DPP authority claimed that the COVID-19 pandemic is the reason for the revision, saying many residents from Taiwan felt inconvenienced while traveling, as their passport was mistaken for the mainland's. The rhetoric is similar to the one 17 years ago, when the Chen Shui-bian-led DPP authority in 2003 added ""Taiwan"" to the passport cover for the first time.The fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China will not change no matter what tricks the DPP plays, Hua Chunying, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said in a briefing Wednesday.In July, the legislative body of Taiwan passed a proposal drafted by secessionists, to emphasize ""Taiwan"" over ""China"" on both China Airlines and the passport. Chinese experts from the mainland and Taiwan consider the move politically provocative, which pushes ""Taiwan secessionism.""Chang Ya-chung, a Taipei-based professor, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the DPP authority cannot and dares not claim ""de jure Taiwan independence,"" and only promotes secessionism through various moves.Backed by the US, the DPP authority continues to challenge the mainland's bottom line. Chang said the Tsai Ing-wen authority does not have the ability to ""say no"" to US. And she will do whatever the Trump administration asks her to do.The Tsai Ing-wen authority got in hot water after recently allowing Ractopamine-enhanced pork from the US, after US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar visited Taiwan.

(Photo by Nemanja Cabric/Xinhua) After the Czech senate speaker's controversial visit to Taiwan, the diplomatic principal officer of the separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities on the island of Taiwan, who published an article in Serbia hyping up secessionism, was met with a backlash, as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia said that the country has always supported the one-China principle, and denounced the article as running totally counter to Serbia's national policy.The Chinese Embassy in Serbia also in a statement condemned that the article as undermining China's sovereignty and going against international consensus, while commending the Serbian government for resolutely adhering to the one-China principle and resolutely opposing ""Taiwan secession.""The Serbian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on its website on Tuesday that it does not recognize the statehood of Taiwan, believes that it is an inalienable part of China and that the central government in Beijing is the only legitimate government representing the entire Chinese people.The ministry denounced the article, saying it damaged the reputation of Serbia and its diplomatic stance.The ministry stressed that Serbia and China have maintained sound political relations and all-round cooperation, and bilateral relations have been upgraded to a comprehensive strategic partnership.The announcement came after Joseph Wu Jaushieh, principal officer of the foreign affairs department of DDP authorities in the Taiwan region, on Tuesday published an article in Serbian media spreading ""Taiwan secession"" and advocating ""Taiwan joining the United Nations (UN) and the World Health Organization (WHO).""In response to the article, the Chinese Embassy in Serbia on Wednesday released a statement saying that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, which is a fact that no one or force can change.The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 explicitly recognizes that the government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing the entire Chinese people.The Chinese embassy said that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China. The issue that ""Taiwan joining the UN"" doesn't exist, said the embassy, noting that the WHO is a specialized agency of the UN composed of sovereign states and should abide by the resolutions of the UN General Assembly with regard to the Taiwan question.The statement condemned the Taiwan secessionists for concocting various excuses to politicize the issue of epidemic prevention in an attempt to use the epidemic to challenge the one-China principle in the international community.It said that China highly appreciates the Serbian government's firm adherence to the one-China principle and resolute opposition to ""Taiwan secession."" We also firmly believe that the upright and friendly Serbian people will, as always, support the Chinese people in safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity, said the embassy.Ignoring the opposition of China and the Czech government, Czech Senate Speaker Milos Vystrcil insisted on visiting the island of Taiwan, instigating secessionist forces, a blatant provocation that ""crossed the line,"" Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a press conference with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas.Global Times "	9/2/20	0	0	0.807	1
"Vystrcil's visit clouds China-Czech economic tiesnPhoto taken on March 31, 2020 shows the view of the empty Old Town Square in Prague, the Czech Republic.Photo:Xinhua Czech Senate Speaker Milos Vystrcil's visit to the island of Taiwan, a blatant violation of the one-China principle, has clouded the Central European na-tion's trade and investment ties with Beijing, regional affairs observers said on Tuesday.The 17+1 initiative underpinning China's cooperation with 16 Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC) and the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) could be leveraged to translate China's footprint in the CEEC into more tangible results, undercutting the mistaken approach to regional cooperation, they noted.Vystrcil landed in Taipei on Sunday on a charter flight operated by Taiwan's China Airlines, making him the highest-ranking sitting Czech official to visit the island.It is likely that such petty tricks are being employed as a bargaining chip for more benefits in trade and investment terms, Cui Hongjian, director of EU studies at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday.But that tactic risks China hitting back, with China playing its economic card to prompt the correction of political wrongdoings on the Czech side, Cui said.Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday criticized the visit to Taiwan, saying that any attempt to challenge the one-China princi-ple will have ""a heavy price.""China-Czech trade rose 5.8 percent year-on-year to $14.37 billion in the first half of the year, accounting for 8.8 percent of the Central European nation's total trade, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in August, citing preliminary data from the Czech Statistical Office.The Czech Republic's exports to China shrank 5.8 percent year-on-year to $1.15 billion during the period, while its imports from China grew 7 percent to $13.22 billion, the data showed.China has become the Czech Republic's second-largest trading partner and its largest trading partner outside the EU. China's actual outstanding invest-ment in the nation hit $2.4 billion and more than 50 Chinese businesses have invested there, creating over 6,000 jobs, according to a posting on the website of the Chinese embassy in Czech in late 2019.Additionally, four direct air routes to Prague have opened in recent years, powering a nearly 30-percent annual rise in Chinese mainland tourist arrivals, the posting said.There is very limited room for an economic team-up between the Central Eu-ropean economy and Taiwan, factoring in the tiny size of the island's economy — especially when compared with the Chinese economy as a whole, Cui commented.Still, instead of wielding an economic weapon, it would make more sense for China to make the best of its involvement in regional cooperation mechanisms to fundamentally mute any ""noises"" that are amplified by the US' rising presence in the CEEC, said Zhu Xiaozhong, a research fellow with the Institute of East European, Russian and Central Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.Chinese investment flows into the region have been impeded by the EU regulatory framework, stirring concerns over insufficient Chinese funding, particularly as the US continues to up the ante in the region with not only a military presence but with public infrastructure investment, Zhu told the Global Times on Tuesday.More tangible projects under the BRI and the 17+1 initiative would serve as an economic stabilizer to maximize friendship between China and these na-tions, essentially thwarting the US attempt to undercut a more robust CEEC strategy toward China, he noted.

"'You crossed the line,' Chinese Foreign Minister warns Czech official's visit to Taiwan islandnChinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi File photo: Xinhua Ignoring opposition of China and the Czech government, Czech Senate Speaker Milos Vystrcil insisted on visiting the island of Taiwan, instigating secessionist forces, a blatant provocation that ""crossed the line,"" Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a press conference with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas.The visit is an act that severely interferes in China's internal affairs, and China has to take a necessary response, Wang said. There is only one China in the world and the island of Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, which is the shared consensus of the international community, Wang noted.""China has to tell the Czech senate president: 'You crossed the line,'"" Wang said. Such an act of supporting Taiwan secessionism and instigating other countries to follow is a blatant provocation, he noted.China has summoned the Czech ambassador to China to protest the Czech senate speaker's visit to Taiwan, while Wang during his ongoing visit to Europe made a rare, strongly worded response to the speaker's act, sending a strong message to other European countries that playing tricks with Taiwan island will incur a heavy price, observers say.Shortly after the Chinese foreign minister said on Monday that anyone who challenges the one-China principle over the Taiwan question would make an enemy of 1.4 billion Chinese people and is a violation of international trust and conduct, he reiterated that insisting on the one-China principle is the political foundation of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the Czech Republic, a political commitment that local officials must follow.Wang has delivered severe condemnations on Vystrcil's visit to Taiwan two days in a row.Vystrcil's visit is a public harm to China's core interests. It obviously went against most countries who agree with the one-China principle and common consensus of the international society, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday.The visit would bring a very bad result, as some anti-China forces in Western countries might follow Vystrcil's example to seize for their political gain and some innocent people would be misled, Li said.But Vystrcil has overrated his power. The relations between China and European countries will only be strengthened. China-Europe ties have their own rhythm which would not be affected by a speculator, Li said. "	9/2/20	0	0	0.6502	1
"US eyes Taiwan as semiconductor factory that poses no threat: observernAn engineer analyzes chips at a chip factory in Nantong, East China's Jiangsu Province in February. Photo: VCG xx The US government said on Monday that it will launch an economic dialogue with the island of Taiwan, soon after which the Taiwan regional government reportedly expressed gratitude to the US for taking action to strengthen their economic ties.However, experts said that the US sees the island only as a semiconductor manufacturing base that poses no threat to its technological hegemony, and they warned that the US' plot may paralyze Taiwan's pillar industry if the mainland shifts to South Korean microchips.According to a statement on the American Institute in Taiwan's website, the annual Economic and Commercial Dialogue - led by US Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment Keith Krach - would explore the full spectrum of the economic relationship such as semiconductors, healthcare and energy, with technology at the core.Chinese mainland observers said that the US' main purpose is to exclude the Chinese mainland from access to the international semiconductor supply chain in its bid to contain the mainland's technological development, instead of what the US called a move to ""bring real progress"" to the US and the island of Taiwan through closer economic cooperation.Apart from serving as a market for the US to dump agricultural products, the only value of the Taiwan economy and its companies for the US seems to be its semiconductor industry, which makes about 50 percent of the world's microchips, Ma Jihua, a veteran industry analyst, told the Global Times on Tuesday.""The US owns core semiconductor technologies, while Taiwan-based foundries like TSMC are good at chip manufacturing. In this sector, Taiwan is complementary to the US, while posing no threat to the US' technological hegemony,"" Ma said.He said that TSMC's plan to build a microchips factory in the US under the Trump administration's pressure implies the US' purpose of getting the island's chip production under its firm control in a bid to ban Chinese mainland's access to advanced chips.With the semiconductor industry contributing about 15 percent of its GDP, Taiwan's dominance in this seemingly tiny but strategically important manufacturing makes it a natural target for the US amid its souring diplomatic ties with the mainland.While the island of Taiwan is dreaming of bright economic prospects by strengthening cooperation with the US, its reliance on the huge market of the mainland means there is a lot at stake for the island.Politicians in the island of Taiwan who continuously push for economic decoupling with the mainland for political gains, without considering the business community's interests, will find there are serious results, a Taiwan affairs expert who preferred to be anonymous told the Global Times on Tuesday.Recently, Huawei reached an agreement with Taiwan-based semiconductor manufacturer MediaTek to supply more than 120 million chips to diversify its supplies amid a tough US chip ban, according to media reports.The expert said that Chinese mainland imports $300 billion worth of microchips a year, of which about $60-70 billion come from Taiwan.""The most advantageous industry for the island of Taiwan can become its biggest weakness,"" the expert said. ""If the mainland shifts to chips made in South Korea or the mainland itself, the island's semiconductor industry would be paralyzed,"" the expert said, noting that history has proved that market demand is the most important factor for an industry's success.""In early years when the island of Taiwan's industrial sector developed fast, many mainland businessmen rushed to the island to invest in the semiconductor sector to supply the mainland. Now faced with political headwinds, they may choose to directly invest in the mainland - in such locations as Shanghai and Xiamen, East China's Fujian Province,"" Ma said. "	9/1/20	0	0	0.9824	1
"US can 'assure Taiwan nothing'nWreckage of a US-made U-2 high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft is on display at the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution in Beijing. The military on the island of Taiwan used U-2s to conduct reconnaissance missions on the Chinese mainland since January 1962, and the PLA Air Force shot down the first U-2 on September 9, 1962 in the suburbs of Nanchang, East China's Jiangxi Province. Photo: Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution The Chinese Foreign Ministry has warned the US not to go any further on a ""wrong and dangerous path"" on Tuesday, after the US declassified its detailed documents showing illegal assurances that were made by Washington to the island of Taiwan in 1982 and posted them on the American Institute in Taiwan's (AIT) website on Monday.Chinese mainland experts said in the past, Washington was cautious about playing the ""Taiwan card"" in dealing with Beijing and it kept a low-profile on making exchanges with Taiwan as Washington used to concern about Beijing's reaction, but the latest move has proven that the hostility among US decision-makers against China is unprecedented, and China should seriously prepare for a final ""showdown"" with the US on the island.The US released two declassified cables from nearly 40 years ago on its security assurances, or the so-called ""six assurances,"" to the island of Taiwan that reflected the US' commitment to the island after it discontinued recognition of the island's ""sovereignty"" and established formal diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1979. The two cables from 1982, declassified on July 16, 2020, and posted on the AIT's website earlier on Monday, focus on arms sales to Taiwan and the 'Six Assurances' made to the island.The six assurances are: the US has not agreed to set a date for ending arms sales to Taiwan; Has not agreed to consult with the PRC on arms sales to Taiwan; Will not play a mediating role between Taipei and Beijing; Has not agreed to revise the Taiwan Relations Act; Has not altered its position regarding sovereignty over Taiwan; Will not exert pressure on Taiwan to enter into negotiations with the PRC.Former US president Ronald Reagan secretly made these assurances to the Chinese island territory in 1982 without informing the PRC. The assurances were made following calls from US defense experts, former officials and pro-Taiwan politicians who received funding as political donations from the island's authorities while serving in Congress at the time.But these assurances are not a secret at all, the US was previously low-profile and few of its diplomats and officials would openly talk about the issues during formal occasions, as they cared about the mainland's reaction, said experts.Hua Chunying, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a routine press conference on Tuesday that ""the Taiwan Relations Act and the so-called six assurances that the US unilaterally made to Taiwan has seriously violated the one-China principle"" and ""the China-US Three Communiqués"" - the ""political foundation and fundamental preconditions"" for China and the US to establish diplomatic ties.""From the very beginning, China has always opposed"" the six assurances and the Taiwan Relations Act, as they are ""totally incorrect, illegal and invalid,"" Hua said.Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of the PRC, remarked on Tuesday that ""the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority's act to rely support from the US for its separatist activities will face consequences, responding to the DPP authorities showing gratitude to the US for reaffirming its assurances.Jin Canrong, associate dean of the Renmin University of China's School of International Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday that in the past, China had made it very clear to the US that the Taiwan question is the relationship's most sensitive issue, so the US has kept a low-profile even if it played the Taiwan card from time to time.But the unprecedented hostility that the Trump administration has shown toward China could at least remind Beijing to abandon any illusions and prepare for a final showdown with the US regarding the Taiwan question, he said.""Now we are not sure if the US would dare to establish formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan or not, and what China can do is to prepare for the worst-case scenario and speed up its military preparation. Once the US breaks the bottom line, the mainland must solve the problem by force once and for all,"" Jin stressed. Taiwan Photo:VCG Although hyping these declassified documents is provocative, the US State Department's top diplomat for East Asia still wants to make it clear that this was not a US policy shift, as the Trump administration understands the consequences, said analysts.David Stilwell, Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told a virtual forum hosted by the conservative Heritage Foundation that the US' latest moves were not a policy shift, but part of a set of ""significant adjustments"" within Washington's longstanding ""one-China"" policy, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.In fact, both US politicians and the Taiwan separatist authorities understand that the US can assure Taiwan nothing if the mainland launches a military operation to reunify the island, and this is why the US always keeps its commitments or assurances to Taiwan vague, Lü Xiang, a research fellow on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday.The US dare not make any clear assurances to Taiwan on sending troops to fight in a war with the mainland once the island is reunified with the mainland by force, and the assurances instead focus on how to make the island an ATM for US military industrial giants, said mainland experts.Lü said the authorities on the island also understand that they are ""pawns on a chessboard"" and that's why they are also afraid of a miscalculation with the mainland.The latest incident has revealed that Taiwan authorities are worried about a potential conflict caused by a miscalculation or accident. A US military aircraft appeared in the skies over Taiwan on Sunday, which was suspected of taking off from a Taiwan-based airfield and flew to Japan, according to a Beijing-based think tank.But on Monday, the Taiwan ""air force"" immediately said the information was ""totally against the facts"" and accused the mainland think tank and media of ""releasing disinformation to damage regional security and stability,"" according to Taiwan media cna.com.A Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times ""it's hilarious that the Taiwan military has accused the mainland think tank and media with such a tone, because it was them and the US who increased military interactions and activities to provoke the mainland recently. And they didn't explain why the aircraft's ADS-B signal was detected in the skies over the island.""This could be a US military plot to fabricate the signal to show the positioning of the aircraft in Taiwan ""airspace,"" increasing the chances of miscalculation and military conflict with the mainland, but the US didn't inform the Taiwan military, and the island's authorities became extremely frightened and worried about its own security once the tensions escalate, but they also dare not blame their ""American bosses,"" said the expert.Lü said a series of ongoing drills in four different regions of the West Pacific by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have already displayed China's stance and determination on the matter, as well as military preparation for a final showdown.Since the US seeks to maintain its provocations, then the war of words would be useless, and China's reaction would be to reveal more of its military operations instead of solely releasing statements, he noted.

Photo: Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution The Chinese Foreign Ministry has warned the US not to go any further on a ""wrong and dangerous path"" on Tuesday, after the US declassified its detailed documents showing illegal assurances that were made by Washington to the island of Taiwan in 1982 and posted them on the American Institute in Taiwan's (AIT) website on Monday.Chinese mainland experts said in the past, Washington was cautious about playing the ""Taiwan card"" in dealing with Beijing and it kept a low-profile on making exchanges with Taiwan as Washington used to concern about Beijing's reaction, but the latest move has proven that the hostility among US decision-makers against China is unprecedented, and China should seriously prepare for a final ""showdown"" with the US on the island.The US released two declassified cables from nearly 40 years ago on its security assurances, or the so-called ""six assurances,"" to the island of Taiwan that reflected the US' commitment to the island after it discontinued recognition of the island's ""sovereignty"" and established formal diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1979. The two cables from 1982, declassified on July 16, 2020, and posted on the AIT's website earlier on Monday, focus on arms sales to Taiwan and the 'Six Assurances' made to the island.The six assurances are: the US has not agreed to set a date for ending arms sales to Taiwan; Has not agreed to consult with the PRC on arms sales to Taiwan; Will not play a mediating role between Taipei and Beijing; Has not agreed to revise the Taiwan Relations Act; Has not altered its position regarding sovereignty over Taiwan; Will not exert pressure on Taiwan to enter into negotiations with the PRC.Former US president Ronald Reagan secretly made these assurances to the Chinese island territory in 1982 without informing the PRC. The assurances were made following calls from US defense experts, former officials and pro-Taiwan politicians who received funding as political donations from the island's authorities while serving in Congress at the time.But these assurances are not a secret at all, the US was previously low-profile and few of its diplomats and officials would openly talk about the issues during formal occasions, as they cared about the mainland's reaction, said experts.Hua Chunying, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a routine press conference on Tuesday that ""the Taiwan Relations Act and the so-called six assurances that the US unilaterally made to Taiwan has seriously violated the one-China principle"" and ""the China-US Three Communiqués"" - the ""political foundation and fundamental preconditions"" for China and the US to establish diplomatic ties.""From the very beginning, China has always opposed"" the six assurances and the Taiwan Relations Act, as they are ""totally incorrect, illegal and invalid,"" Hua said.Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of the PRC, remarked on Tuesday that ""the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority's act to rely support from the US for its separatist activities will face consequences, responding to the DPP authorities showing gratitude to the US for reaffirming its assurances.Jin Canrong, associate dean of the Renmin University of China's School of International Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday that in the past, China had made it very clear to the US that the Taiwan question is the relationship's most sensitive issue, so the US has kept a low-profile even if it played the Taiwan card from time to time.But the unprecedented hostility that the Trump administration has shown toward China could at least remind Beijing to abandon any illusions and prepare for a final showdown with the US regarding the Taiwan question, he said.""Now we are not sure if the US would dare to establish formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan or not, and what China can do is to prepare for the worst-case scenario and speed up its military preparation. Once the US breaks the bottom line, the mainland must solve the problem by force once and for all,"" Jin stressed. Taiwan Photo:VCG Although hyping these declassified documents is provocative, the US State Department's top diplomat for East Asia still wants to make it clear that this was not a US policy shift, as the Trump administration understands the consequences, said analysts.David Stilwell, Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told a virtual forum hosted by the conservative Heritage Foundation that the US' latest moves were not a policy shift, but part of a set of ""significant adjustments"" within Washington's longstanding ""one-China"" policy, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.In fact, both US politicians and the Taiwan separatist authorities understand that the US can assure Taiwan nothing if the mainland launches a military operation to reunify the island, and this is why the US always keeps its commitments or assurances to Taiwan vague, Lü Xiang, a research fellow on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday.The US dare not make any clear assurances to Taiwan on sending troops to fight in a war with the mainland once the island is reunified with the mainland by force, and the assurances instead focus on how to make the island an ATM for US military industrial giants, said mainland experts.Lü said the authorities on the island also understand that they are ""pawns on a chessboard"" and that's why they are also afraid of a miscalculation with the mainland.The latest incident has revealed that Taiwan authorities are worried about a potential conflict caused by a miscalculation or accident. A US military aircraft appeared in the skies over Taiwan on Sunday, which was suspected of taking off from a Taiwan-based airfield and flew to Japan, according to a Beijing-based think tank.But on Monday, the Taiwan ""air force"" immediately said the information was ""totally against the facts"" and accused the mainland think tank and media of ""releasing disinformation to damage regional security and stability,"" according to Taiwan media cna.com.A Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times ""it's hilarious that the Taiwan military has accused the mainland think tank and media with such a tone, because it was them and the US who increased military interactions and activities to provoke the mainland recently. And they didn't explain why the aircraft's ADS-B signal was detected in the skies over the island.""This could be a US military plot to fabricate the signal to show the positioning of the aircraft in Taiwan ""airspace,"" increasing the chances of miscalculation and military conflict with the mainland, but the US didn't inform the Taiwan military, and the island's authorities became extremely frightened and worried about its own security once the tensions escalate, but they also dare not blame their ""American bosses,"" said the expert.Lü said a series of ongoing drills in four different regions of the West Pacific by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have already displayed China's stance and determination on the matter, as well as military preparation for a final showdown.Since the US seeks to maintain its provocations, then the war of words would be useless, and China's reaction would be to reveal more of its military operations instead of solely releasing statements, he noted.

"US military collusion with Taiwan doomed to failnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT The New York Times on Sunday claimed that Taiwan is moving to ""revamp its military"" and ""bolster its armed forces."" This will be done to ""deter or defeat an invasion"" from the Chinese mainland ""with or without American help."" However, Taiwan's attempt to collude with the US and use military force to resist reunification is doomed to fail.Taiwan's military seriously lacks discipline and its combat capacity is also insufficient, despite the island's increasing focus on military strength. Taiwan in August unveiled a 10.2 percent increase for planned defense spending in 2021. During Taiwan's annual Han Kuang military exercises in July, a Bell OH-58D Kiowa helicopter crashed minutes after taking off, killing two. Also, two Taiwan marines were killed and another committed suicide during the exercises. This is hardly a strong force.These frequent accidents show that there are serious problems in Taiwan's military. These range from a lack of discipline, shortage of training time and insufficient professional skills. In total, these seriously affect their combat readiness. Taiwan's military training and exercises have almost become a show or a child's play. They cannot help improve the island's real combat capability.More importantly, many soldiers do not know whom to fight for. Nor do they know what they are fighting for. They have wavered on this fundamental question. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities are promoting Taiwan secessionism. This will seriously affect the situation across the Taiwan Straits. Many Taiwan military officers and soldiers believe that secessionism has no future. This is also the main reason why Taiwan's military has somewhat lost their combat capability - it has lost its purpose and emotional anchor too.On Monday, Taiwan released its ""China military power report 2020,"" claiming that the People's liberation Army (PLA) does not yet have the capability to wage an all-out war against the island. This is purely self-deception and not even worth refuting. The DPP authorities stubbornly adhere to secessionism and have gone too far to collude with the US. They have become the biggest threat to peace and stability across the Straits. This being the case, using military force to accomplish ""Taiwan secession"" is pure illusion. All Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan, will never agree to this wanton fantasy, this bonfire of the vanities.Sadly, the Taiwan question has become a focus of the ongoing China-US competition. Washington has been hyping this question, and is trying to drive a wedge between Taiwan and the mainland. In August, Taiwan formally signed an agreement with the US arms firm Lockheed Martin to buy 66 F-16V jets. In this deal, the US blatantly violated the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués by providing military support to Taiwan. This shamelessly undermines China's sovereignty.Meanwhile, Taiwan's purchase of F-16V jets will not change the military situation across the Straits. Nor will it help the DPP authorities with their silly ambitions of the so-called Taiwan secession plan. It is wishful thinking to try to achieve a military balance between Taiwan and the mainland. After all, how can Taiwan compare with the whole mainland?Furthermore, the American Institute in Taiwan on Monday released two allegedly declassified cables which mention the ""six assurances."" Among these are assurances that the US ""has not agreed to set a date for ending arms sales to Taiwan,"" and ""has not agreed to revise the Taiwan Relations Act"" and ""has not altered its position regarding sovereignty over Taiwan.""These are not effective legal texts at all. The US aims to provoke the mainland and give DPP authorities a false illusion that they can move even further on the road of Taiwan secessionism. For decades, the US has been using Taiwan as a pawn to contain the Chinese mainland. Such a trick will never succeed.As the US and Taiwan continued to collude with military plans, the PLA responded by conducting massive military drills in the Taiwan Straits in August. These may be a rehearsal of some military actions that may be taken to achieve national reunification. The drills also send a strong warning to Taiwan secessionists. The PLA's military modernization has developed rapidly in recent years. Its military standards have been greatly improved with momentous advancements. If any force attempts to separate Taiwan from China, the PLA will resolutely defeat it at all costs to defend national unity. The writing is plainly on the wall - as is the bottom line of their patience.The author is a senior research fellow at the PLA Naval Military Studies Research Institute. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	9/1/20	0	0	-0.9944	-1
"China summons Czech envoy, warns Czech officials of paying 'heavy price' for Taiwan visitnCzech Senate Speaker Milos Vystrcil waves upon his arrival at Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport on Sunday. Photo: AFP China has summoned Czech Ambassador to China to protest over Czech senate speaker's visit to Taiwan while Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi during his ongoing visit to Europe made a rare strongly worded response to the speaker's act, sending a strong message to other European countries that playing tricks with Taiwan island will pay a heavy price.Analysts believe that the Czech Republic's move was extremely bad in nature as Vystrcil was the first senate speaker of a European country with diplomatic relations with Beijing visited the island. However, it will not be followed by other European countries, as some media in the island expect, analysts said.Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Qin Gang summoned Czech Ambassador to China Vladimir Tomsik to lodge stern representation and strong protest against Czech Senate Speaker Milos Vystrcil's visit to Taiwan, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday.Qin said that regardless of China's firm opposition and solemn representation, for his own personal gains, Vystrcil is visiting Taiwan island tempted by the Taiwan authority and instigated by anti-China forces.This is a blatant support to the separatists on the island and has severely violated China's sovereignty and interfered in China's domestic affairs. China strongly condemns the move, the statement said.China urges the Czech Republic to take seriously China's stern stance and concerns, and not to underestimate the firm resolve and willingness of the 1.4 billion Chinese people to safeguard the nation's sovereignty and integrity.Meanwhile Wang said during his visit in Germany on Monday that anyone who challenges the one-China principle over the Taiwan question is to make an enemy of 1.4 billion Chinese people and is a violation of international trust and conduct.Wang stressed that the Chinese government and Chinese people will not sit idly by when challenged by the Czech politician's blatant provocation and the anti-China power behind the politician, and will let him pay a heavy price for the short-sighted move and political speculation.Vystrcil started his visit to the island of Taiwan on Sunday, seeking business cooperation with the island. He was due to meet Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen.Chinese analysts said Wang's response, made when he was in Europe, was tougher than previous ones, and sent a warning to European politicians that China will never allow them to challenge China's core interests.By mentioning the 1.4 billion Chinese people, the remarks by both Wang and Qin were also a response to the US' repeated provocation aimed at separating the Chinese people from the Communist Party of China, and sent a warning to Europe that following the US will complicate China-Europe relations, and that Europe will not like to see it, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Monday.Cui said the Czech Republic's move is an isolated case in Europe, and was the result of following the US in its China containment policy. But it will not spread to other European countries.Major countries in Europe, such as Germany and France, uphold strategic independence and multilateralism amid mounting US pressure, that has led the EU to deepen relations with China on bilateral and international levels, and they will not undermine the basis for cooperation, analysts said.The Czech Republic has more frequently challenged China on sensitive issues involving Taiwan, Xinjiang and Tibet, and had a strong domestic political anti-China basis, but this was not the case in other European countries, Cui said.However, some European countries have played small tricks with the island in recent years, and Chinese senior diplomats' response served as a strong warning to them, he said.The Netherlands changed its trade and investment office in Taiwan island to the Netherlands Office Taipei in April, aimed at lifting its political relations with the island, and it irritated Chinese netizens who called on the Chinese companies to stop selling medical supplies to the country.For the Czech Republic, China is likely to exert pressure on the Czech government and urge it to publicly and formally oppose the visit and take measures to compensate for the mistake, Yang Lixian, a research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center of Cross-Straits Relations, told the Global Times on Monday.China is the second biggest trading partner of the Czech Republic, and 50 Chinese companies invested in the country as of the end of 2018, creating 6,000 domestic jobs.On Chinese social media, some netizens called on China to not resume air travel to the country even after the pandemic ebbs, and called on others not to travel or do business with the Czech government and companies.For some Taiwan media, Vystrcil's visit was very exciting news, with some even opening a special channel to cover his visit. DPP authorities hyped ""democracy"", claiming both the Czech Republic and the island have the same democratic values.Cui said the island hyped democracy to chime in with the US in urging European countries to isolate from China. But it's futile.And interaction between the island and a small European country can hardly shake the foundations of China-Europe relations, analysts said. "	8/31/20	0	0	-0.1229	-1
"US intends to force China to 'fire first shot' over TaiwannAttack helicopters attached to an army aviation brigade under the PLA 80th Group Army hover to engage in the last-minute inspections before lift-off for a round-the-clock flight training exercise on August 25, 2020.Photo:China Military A US military aircraft appeared in the skies over Taiwan on Sunday, which was suspected of taking off from a Taiwan-based airfield and flew to Japan, although the Taiwan ""air force"" said it was against the facts. The incident took place as the island's military claims that the Chinese mainland does not possess ""enough capabilities"" to launch an all-out attack on Taiwan.Mainland experts warn that Washington is provoking Beijing to fire the first shot, and that current tensions could further escalate.An EP-3E reconnaissance aircraft has been spotted in the northern ""airspace"" of Taiwan and flew to Japan over the East China Sea on Sunday and this unusual flight-path showed that the aircraft potentially took off from an airport on the island, according to information released by the website of the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI), a Beijing based think tank.According to the SCSPI, the aircraft was spotted in the south of the island conducting a reconnaissance mission in the South China Sea a day earlier, but with no landing signals showing it returned to the US' Kadena air force base in Okinawa, which means that the US aircraft may have not returned to Okinawa but landed on Taiwan island instead. The Chinese mainland warned this incident could be a serious provocation toward China and may escalate tensions.However, Taiwan ""air force command"" responded on Monday that the information released by the SCSPI is ""totally against the facts,"" Taiwan media cna.com reported.The SCSPI uses an Automatic identification system and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) to track vessels and aircraft. Information in these two systems is open source commercial data, and accessible via multiple routes in China and abroad.Hu Bo, director of the SCSPI, told the Global Times on Monday the ADS-B signal that the US military aircraft broadcast is incomplete, so the flight-path of the aircraft showed on the system is also incomplete, as the pilots of that EP-3E could choose to turn off broadcasting with no signal being released from it.""Or, signal interference could also make the ADS-B of that aircraft show deviation, and it is also possible that the US military aircraft has fabricated the ADS-B signal, which means that EP-3E wasn't in fact there,"" Hu noted.But if that EP-3E really landed and took off from a Taiwan-based military airport, no matter for what reason, it could be a serious provocation toward the Chinese mainland, Hu stressed, adding that even if it didn't land or take off from an airport on the island, it's appearance in the sky over Taiwan is also a serious provocation toward China's sovereignty.That's why Taiwan military officials have to deny the incident as they know how serious this could get if US military aircraft really landed on the island, said Chinese mainland experts.On the other hand, if the US fabricated the signal to increase the chances for miscalculation, then it means the US doesn't want to avoid conflict with China at all, and it intends to create tensions and even provoke China into firing the first shot, potentially making it more terrifying and dangerous, Chinese experts warned.On August 18, Taiwan media also reported that an EP-3E from the US Air Force was suspected of landing at the Taipei Songshan Airport, but later, Taiwan military officers ""privately"" denied the speculation.Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert, told the Global Times on Monday that using Taiwan-based airports as bases for intelligence-gathering aircraft makes US reconnaissance missions against the Chinese mainland much easier and more efficient as Taiwan is closer to the mainland than Okinawa, so ""regardless if the incident is real or not, the US does have motivation to engage in risky military cooperation with the separatist authorities on the island.""Chinese mainland military analysts said if military cooperation between the US and the island was discovered and poses real threats to the mainland and challenges the sovereignty of China, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) will be forced to take effective action to eliminate that threat and may even realize reunification by force once and for all, although the mainland does not wish to escalate tensions.

The PLA is focusing on fighting a tough enemy, or the most powerful military force on the planet, in a potential war in the region, so the PLA could even realize a military advantage against the US in the region, and the conclusion made by the Taiwan military is just nonsense,"" Song further said.For the mainland, the best response to provocative moves made by the US military and the nonsense remarks made by the island's military is to be comprehensively prepared for military operations against Taiwan, especially preparing for a military conflict with the US, Song noted.Jin Canrong, associate dean of Renmin University of China's School of International Studies, told the Global Times previously that the mainland should make its military deterrence more visible and build up enough deterrence to intimidate the US and the separatists of Taiwan, effectively eliminating their motivation of challenging China's bottom line.This kind of thinking has also been reflected in the reality of the PLA's drills in the region amid tensions with the US. China launched a series of ballistic missiles into the South China Sea this week, according to US defense officials, CNN reported on Saturday, and some of these missiles are ""aircraft carrier killers"" like the DF-21D and DF-26, but the Chinese military and other relevant departments didn't confirm the launches.The Maritime Safety Administration of Liaoning Province released a notice on Monday that from Tuesday to September 22, there will be ""military missions"" in the waters of the Bohai Sea. Some military analysts said this area is normally used for testing submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM), and this could be a test for a new generation SLBM and possibly mean that China wants to employ a strategic-level of deterrence toward the US, as the latter is becoming increasingly provocative.

"Tsai authorities deserve a stern warning from Beijing: Global Times editorialnIllustration: Xia Qing/GT The South China Sea Probing Initiative on Monday spotted the abnormal path of a US Navy EP-3E reconnaissance aircraft, which was suspected of taking off from Taiwan island. The island's authorities haven't confirmed or denied it.If the island has made arrangements of take-offs and landings of US military jets, it is crossing the Chinese mainland's redline to safeguard national unity. This will be very serious. If the mainland has conclusive evidence, it can destroy the relevant airport in the island and the US military aircraft that land there - a war in the Taiwan Straits will thus begin.We need to warn Tsai Ing-wen authorities and Washington again: Don't play with fire. The Chinese mainland is resolute in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity. We don't want to fight a war, but we will firmly respond to the moves that aim to split our country.The US and Taiwan island are increasingly colluding. The American Institute in Taiwan on Thursday posted a photo showing a US Air Force tanker refueling a fighter jet of the island. This was pure provocation. Public opinion on the mainland is getting fed up with the collusion between the island and Washington. More and more people don't believe peaceful reunification could be an option, with reunification by force more widely discussed.The Tsai authorities say they hope for peace, but are actually pushing the Taiwan Straits toward war. They take for granted that they can disintegrate the mainland's will with salami-slicing style tactics and eventually force the mainland to accept the island's secession and legitimate role on the world stage.DPP authorities in recent years have been overly arrogant. They don't believe the mainland would dare to resort to military means. We think Beijing should consider taking tough measures to send Tsai authorities a strong warning over the Taiwan question.We suggest Beijing officially declare the ""airspace"" over the Taiwan island as a patrol area of the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The PLA's reconnaissance aircraft and fighter jets will perform missions over Taiwan island. These military aircraft could declare sovereignty, and could check whether there are US military planes landing at Taiwan's airports or US warships docking at the island's ports. If the island's military dares to fire the first shot at the PLA's aircraft, it will mean provocation of a war, and the PLA should immediately destroy Taiwan's military forces and achieve reunification through military means.Washington has taken Taiwan island as a prominent pawn in its strategic suppression of Beijing, and Tsai authorities are eager to be part of the US' China strategy. This has had a long-term negative impact on the cross-Straits situation. Beijing must destroy the US pawn. The DPP has rejected the 1992 consensus, mistakenly believing they could safely realize ""Taiwan secession"" by relying on the US. If they are not taught a lesson, they won't change.PLA fighter jets patrol above Taiwan, and the risks not only go to the Chinese mainland, but also the Taiwan military, Taiwan authorities and the US. It is a contest of will and strength. The mainland should look for an appropriate opportunity to announce this decision, and the PLA fighter jets make their debut above Taiwan island. The opportunity may be when US planes land in Taiwan or high-level US officials visit Taiwan. At that time, it is more reasonable if the mainland sends warplanes to claim sovereignty, and the mainland will win more understanding from international opinion.DPP authorities are just a mere clod. As we crack down on the DPP's arrogance, we can then regulate the behavior of Taiwan authorities. Peaceful reunification must be pushed forward, with military punishment as a restraint rather than using beautiful visions to entice. Unfortunately, the reality in the Taiwan Straits has once again proven this. "	8/31/20	0	0	-0.8571	-1
"Wang Yi: Anyone who challenges one-China principle will pay 'heavy price'nVisiting Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi (L) touches elbows with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian in Paris, France, Aug. 29, 2020.

He warned anti-China forces behind the Czech official, saying their scheme is doomed to failure and anyone who challenges the one-China principle will pay a heavy price.Also, the Chinese Embassy in Czech on Saturday expressed strong opposition to the visit.China has always opposed countries with formal diplomatic ties with the mainland conducting official exchanges with the Taiwan region, said the embassy. The embassy urged the Czech side to abide by the one-China principle - there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China - and take concrete actions to safeguard the overall interests of China-Czech relations.The embassy said Vystrcil has seriously interfered in China's internal affairs and infringed on China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity, condemning the Czech Senate speaker for ignoring mainstream Czech public opinion and insisted on visiting Taiwan out of personal political calculations.Global Times "	8/31/20	0	0	-0.8674	-1

He warned anti-China forces behind the Czech official, saying their scheme is doomed to failure and anyone who challenges the one-China principle will pay a heavy price.Also, the Chinese Embassy in Czech on Saturday expressed strong opposition to the visit.China has always opposed countries with formal diplomatic ties with the mainland conducting official exchanges with the Taiwan region, said the embassy. The embassy urged the Czech side to abide by the one-China principle - there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China - and take concrete actions to safeguard the overall interests of China-Czech relations.The embassy said Vystrcil has seriously interfered in China's internal affairs and infringed on China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity, condemning the Czech Senate speaker for ignoring mainstream Czech public opinion and insisted on visiting Taiwan out of personal political calculations.Global Times "	8/31/20	0	0	-0.8674	-1
"Czech Senate speaker's Taiwan visit trades ties with mainland for short-term gains: expertsnTaiwan Photo: Unsplash The speaker of the Czech Republic's Senate is scheduled to visit the island of Taiwan on Sunday, a move that has been opposed by not only the Chinese mainland but also the Czech president's office. Chinese analysts warned some Czech politicians not to sacrifice their country's national interests with regard to China for their short-term political gain.They noted that the US and the separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities in Taiwan are using the divisions in the Czech Republic to serve their own interests and harm China-Czech ties, which is more important to the Czech Republic.Reuters reported that Milos Vystrcil, the speaker of the Czech upper house of parliament, will travel to the island with ""a trade mission"" for six days as the head of a delegation of about 90 political and business leaders.Taiwan-based media reported on Tuesday that the delegation will attend an investment forum and an enterprise media cooperation conference on Monday.The visit has been opposed not only by the Chinese mainland but also within the Czech Republic.In June, the Chinese Embassy in the Czech Republic has already expressed firm opposition in a statement released on its website, saying China has always opposed countries with formal diplomatic ties with China that conduct official exchanges with the Taiwan region, and urged some Czech politicians not to violate the one-China principle - there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China - which is recognized by the UN, EU and the Czech government.The spokesperson of Czech president's office Jiri Ovcacek said on Twitter that the visit was ""not recommended"" by Czech President Milos Zeman, as well as the prime minister and foreign minister of the country.However, due to the country's internal divisions, some Chinese analysts said China could retaliate against politicians who provoke China's sovereignty, and avoid harming Czech companies in China if they do nothing wrong. Also, the visit could potentially further sour the country's relations with China.Yang Lixian, a research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center of Cross-Straits Relations, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the Czech Republic would ""lose much more than they gain"" if they choose the DPP authorities of Taiwan over the Chinese mainland.""Considering the mainland's economic strength and contributions to the international community, it is clear that the Czech Republic should not turn its back on the Chinese mainland.""Earlier this month, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo welcomed the planned trip.Yang noted it is normal for a country to have different political stances, but the internal divisions in the Czech Republic are ""being exploited by the US to suppress China"" and harm China's sovereignty.Jin Yi, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, also pointed out that the US is forcing other countries to pick sides and challenge the one-China principle, and the Czech Republic ""will not be the last one.""""China will retaliate when some Czech politicians further challenge China's sovereignty,"" Yang said.The DPP authorities in the island of Taiwan have used a lot of resources to make trouble for China-Czech ties, and split the Czech government and Senate in recent years, citing different excuses.DPP authorities keep saying ""this is the highest-ranking Czech official to visit Taiwan ever.""

"Vystrcil's Taiwan visit an opportunistic stunt: Global Times editorialnCzech Senate Speaker Milos Vystrcil waves upon his arrival at Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport on Sunday. Photo: AFP Czech Senate Speaker Milos Vystrcil landed in Taipei Sunday on a Taiwan's China Airlines charter flight, a visit which blatantly violates the one-China principle. Vystrcil is the highest-ranking sitting Czech official to visit the island, as well as the first head of senate among European countries which have established diplomatic relations with China to have visited the island. The visit is vicious in nature.Vystrcil claimed his Taiwan trip is to show support for democracy, and the Czech Senate accused that China's opposition against the trip interfered in the Czech Republic's internal affairs. Such false logic is quite twisted. Respecting the one-China principle and not developing official ties with the island of Taiwan are commitments of all countries that have established diplomatic ties with China. That's why the senate speaker of all other European countries does not visit Taiwan.Vystrcil is a rule-breaker who is trampling on diplomatic civilization. His gilding for his evil deeds is a manifestation of being a political hooligan.To what extent Vystrcil's tour represents his country is difficult to define. Czech President Milos Zeman and Foreign Minister Tomas Petricek have publicly expressed their opposition to the visit, saying it would jeopardize China-Czech Republic relations. But according to the country's constitution, Vystrcil is the second-highest official in the Czech Republic. At the same time, the senate is filled with the most diverse opinions in the Czech Republic as well as other Western countries. Now the Czech government and its senate are controlled by different political parties. This tells the situation of how much Vystrcil represents his country.The Czech Republic is a small county in Europe. Vystrcil is obviously trying to pull a stunt by visiting Taiwan. Some Czech forces have a tendency of forcing ideological factors into the country's diplomacy. This is considered to be related to the Czech history of being a Soviet satellite state. Those forces tend to behave more aggressively in terms of anti-Communist, so as to declare they are already a member of the West.Vystrcil's plan to visit Taiwan was raised last year, which reminds us of a saying: There's no smoke without fire. Over the past two years, the US has drastically changed its China policy, and has launched a whole-of-government attack against China, instigating its European allies to engage in a new cold war against China. These have offered a driving force for Vystrcil's agenda and practice of promoting the tour to Taiwan.Vystrcil's tour is a result of him and some Czech politicians seeing which way the wind blows and gauging Washington's intent. A few years ago, he would not have the nerve to challenge the one-China principle by visiting the island of Taiwan. This is a new unpleasant reality - the US will always be able to find forces in certain countries to echo its intention to open a front against China. It is not easy for the US to sway countries with close contacts and in-depth cooperation with China, but some forces in countries with relatively less economic cooperation with China are eager to become Washington's accomplice. Vystrcil may not be the last opportunist to break the rules on the Taiwan question.The one-China principle has long been one of the cornerstones of the modern international relations' system. Just as international norms such as not changing the territorial status quo, respecting every country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, the one-China principle is also part of the foundation of the world order. However, the US is stirring up troubles on the principle for the sake of containing China. In this regard, it has continued to lob stones in the water and there will surely be ripples. We should leave nothing to chance when facing the coming challenges.Vystrcil is attracting eyeballs and promoting his status by visiting Taiwan. When we escalate our response toward his provocations, we have to some extent helped him achieve his goal. Yet ignoring him might seem that his behavior is being indulged. To begin with, we should not be riled. China has gone through ups and downs in its ties with the US, so a Czech Senate speaker who comes to Taiwan to seek troubles is just a nobody. China can well respond as needed according to its strength and toolbox.After all, the one-China principle cannot be determined by a small, remote Central European country's senate speaker, or Washington. It is determined by China's strength, the will of the 1.4 billion Chinese people, the country's forceful Anti-Secession Law and the supervision and implementation of the law by the powerful People's Liberation Army. Vystrcil is playing an insignificant role and will left nothing after the tour. "	8/30/20	0	0	0.8955	1
"Czech politicians’ ‘visit’ to Taiwan will only harm Czech’s own interestsnTaiwan Photo: Unsplash Czech Senate President Milos Vystrcil was set to lead a delegation to the island of Taiwan on Sunday, the highest-ranking official of the Czech Republic to ever visit the island. A Chinese expert said the move was instigated by the US, that it will only harm China-Czech Republic relations and the Central European country's own interests, and suggested that China retaliates against politicians who meddle in China's sovereignty issues.""Vystrcil's visit to Taiwan has a strong connection to current China-US 'decoupling,'"" Lü Cuncheng, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Saturday.Anti-China forces in the Czech Republic have been incited by the US to play the so-called Taiwan card and they would hijack and compromise China-Czech Republic relations, said Lü. ""This will do nothing but harm the Czech Republic's own interests. The Chinese mainland is far more important to the Czech Republic than is the island of Taiwan,"" Lü noted.US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar visited the island of Taiwan earlier in August.In response to a letter from Reinhard Butikofer and Maria Spyraki, members of the European Parliament (MEP), to Ambassador Zhang Ming, Head of the Chinese Mission to the European Union, about ""concern"" over China's opposition to Vystrcil's planned trip to Taiwan, Zhang said in a written reply that Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, and Taiwan affairs are China's internal affairs, Mission of the People's Republic of China to the European Union posted on its website on Saturday.Zhang stressed that the one-China principle, which is well recognized by the international community including the UN and the EU, is a prerequisite and political basis for the maintenance and development of friendship and cooperation between China and other countries, noting that the principle concerns China's core interests and the sentiments of the 1.4 billion Chinese people.China is categorically against any form of official contacts between Taiwan and countries with diplomatic ties with China. This position is consistent and clear-cut. It does not make any sense for any MEP to interfere in internal affairs of other countries, Zhang noted.Vystrcil will lead a delegation of about 90 people, including Prague mayor Zdenek Hrib, to the island of Taiwan from Sunday to September 4, during which Vystrcil is scheduled to deliver a speech at National Chengchi University on Monday, the Brussels-based independent English weekly newspaper New Europe reported on Friday.The Czech Republic has diplomatic ties with China, and the head of its Senate is the second highest-ranking official after the country's president according to its Constitution, said the media.""Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is colluding with external anti-China forces only to seek short-term political benefits. The DPP has hijacked all the people of Taiwan to the dead end of 'Taiwan independence,' and makes them bear the risk of cross-Straits military conflict,"" Lü said. ""DPP will have to bear all the consequences.""However, Lü also pointed out that the domestic political environment of the Czech Republic is complicated, and the visit has been widely criticized within the country.According to Czech Radio, Czech President Milos Zeman, Prime Minister Andrej Babis (ANO), and Foreign Minister Tomas Petricek (Social Democrats), were among the Czech politicians who opposed to the trip.Jiri Ovcacek, spokesperson for Czech president's office, said previously on Twitter that the president, prime minister and foreign minister said the visit was ""not recommended.""Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters Thursday that some Czech politicians are making the trip out of their own personal interests. They are disregarding China's solemn negotiations, ignoring mainstream public opinion of the Czech Republic, openly violating the one-China principle that has been consistently pursued by the Czech government, and deliberately destroying the political foundation of China-Czech Republic relations.""China condemns this despicable act and urges the Czech side to abide by the one-China principle and handle Taiwan-related questions correctly and prudently,"" said Zhao.""China cannot tolerate such an odious act by Czech politicians that infringes on China's core interests,"" said Lü.""Due to the complexity of the Czech domestic political environment, China should retaliate precisely against anti-China politicians in the Czech Republic, to prevent China-Czech Republic relations from being fundamentally damaged,"" Lü noted.

"Thwarting cross-Straits exchanges hurts Taiwan’s development: MOFCOMnPhoto:VCG Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities in the island of Taiwan have been trying to thwart exchanges and cross-Straits cooperation for some time, and that will only curb the growth of Taiwan's economy, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) spokesperson Gao Feng told reporters on Thursday, responding to whether the cross-Straits Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) will continue.Based on the 1992 Consensus, the trade pact was signed in 2010 to remove trade barriers between the Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan, with a length of 10 years. The agreement will expire next month.As of the end of 2019, the Chinese mainland had exempted tariffs for the island of Taiwan by $6.15 billion, and 56 financial enterprises and 1,333 non-financial enterprises in Taiwan had benefited from the preferential policies spelt out in the ECFA to provide services to the mainland, Gao said.The benefits brought by the cross-Strait trade pact to small and medium-sized enterprises, farmers and fishermen based in Taiwan are tangible and visible, said Gao.However, he pointed out ""that for some time, the DPP authorities have been using various accusations and other means to obstruct and destroy cross-Straits exchanges and cooperation, which will only limit the space for Taiwan's economic development and jeopardize the interests of Taiwan people.""The obstruction of cross-Straits exchanges and cooperation has now spread to the telecoms sector.On Wednesday, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office issued a joint statement on 5G security, a move aimed at blocking Huawei 's 5G.""It is a purely political decision that is irrelevant when considering Taiwan's telecoms industry development,"" Xiang Ligang, a veteran tech industry analyst based in Beijing, told the Global Times on Thursday.The Chinese mainland and Taiwan have close connections in the sector of information and communication technology, and Xiang said that many Taiwan-made products are sold to the Chinese mainland.Since the island of Taiwan just started its 5G rollout, it is unwise to exclude equipment suppliers from the mainland, Xiang said.

"Possible ban on Taobao Taiwan enrages localsnScreenshot of Taobao Taiwan site Taiwan's separatist authority appears to be setting the stage to ban e-commerce platform Taobao Taiwan, as it did two other mainland internet platforms last week, sparking more outrage among shoppers and experts who condemned the government for playing politics at the cost of local people's interests.Taiwan on Monday fined online shopping platform NT$410,000 ($13,951) and ordered it to either withdraw from the market or restructure its ownershipThe government equates Taobao Taiwan, a registered UK company, as subsidiary of Chinese mainland's e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, which owns 28.77 percent of Taobao Taiwan. The Local authority said Taobao Taiwan violates Taiwan's investment rules, which treats investment by foreign countries differently than mainland investment A possibility of a ban on Taobao Taiwan has astonished and angered local residents who are still reeling after the Tsai Ing-wen authority banned the mainland streaming services providers Tencent and iQIYI last week.Some residents reached by the Global Times complained that the bans create an additional financial burden to them, as Taiwan's stagnant economy and the COVID-19 pandemic have forced many people to live with less.A resident of New Taipei City, surnamed Chen, who often buys clothes from Taobao Taiwan, said the platform is popular among Taiwan people because prices are usually much lower than those of similar quality found on Taiwan's local shopping sites.Chen pointed to product that sold for 20 yuan ($2.9) on Taobao Taiwan but was listed NT$399 ($58) on the island's native e-commerce platform Momo. ""For ordinary people who have to pay rents and feed their children on low salaries, Taobao Taiwan is a good platform to save money,"" Chen said told the Global Times Tuesday.The popularity of Taobao Taiwan has helped deepen ties between Taiwan residents and the mainland, which the local authority reluctant to see, said Taiwan financial scholar Yu Chih-pin. ""The Tsai government is trying all means to isolate the link [between the mainland and Taiwan] with its political conspiracies,"" he said.Chen worries that the Taiwan people's cost of living will rise if Taobao Taiwan is forced off the island.""There are numerous poor people on the island struggling to make a living, but the Tsai authority doesn't seem to care whether they live or die,"" she sighed.By considering Taobao Taiwan to be a mainland-backed enterprises, the Tsai government is fawning over the US and imitating its potential ban on the mainland's apps TikTok and WeChat, said Taiwan native Tang, who also buys from Taobao Taiwan.""I'm bored with the Tsai authority's tricks (targeting the mainland) like this,"" Tang told the Global Times.

"Taiwan's new representative office in France like spiritual opium, provocative move risks backfiring: observersnTaiwan Photo:VCG The opening of Taiwan's representative office in the Southern French city of Aix-en-Provence is a provocative action from the gang of Taiwan secessionists, and the dangerous self-consolation will backfire.The foreign affairs authority on the island of Taiwan announced the decision on Tuesday afternoon, saying it was made due to the growing interactions between the island and France regarding business, culture and education.Although some secessionists on the island took the establishment of the office as a ""diplomatic breakthrough,"" while the island leader Tsai Ing-wen boasted about it via a Twitter post on Tuesday, mainland experts believe that Taiwan's self-pleasing move is like spiritual opium obtained through provoking the Chinese mainland, especially before Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi's upcoming visit to France.Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that a representative office like this does not involve diplomatic affairs, and its authority is limited, mostly handling service-oriented affairs.Taiwan's foreign affairs authority said the office will provide services to Taiwan people living in or traveling to France, revealing that the number of Taiwan people traveling to France in 2019 increased by 62 percent compared to 2016.However, Taiwan's actions are dangerously provocative before Wang's visit to France, which reflects the speculative mentality of the secessionists, said Li, noting the Chinese mainland will show no mercy to the Taiwan secessionists' gang.Taiwan's authorities did not reveal when the office would be inaugurated, nor personnel arrangements.Any Chinese diplomat will stress that the Taiwan question is China's internal affairs and the one-China principle is the political basis for cooperation with China, said Li, calling for the French side to be more cautious in handling issues about Taiwan.In Europe, Taiwan has more than one representative office only in Germany, the UK and Switzerland. France will become the fourth European country to have more than one representative office for the island of Taiwan, Zaobao.com reported on Tuesday. "	8/26/20	0	0	-0.2944	-1
"US deeply involved in Taiwan Island's politics, peaceful reunification unlikely: former KMT officialnPhoto: Tsai Cheng-Yuan The US has deeply involved in the island of Taiwan's politics, and the possibility of a peaceful reunification is fading, the former deputy secretary-general of the Kuomintang (KMT) Tsai Cheng-Yuan said in an exclusive interview with the Global Times.One month before the 2020 Taiwan regional leader election, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) personnel had threatened some media bosses of the Blue Camp to change their stance, Tsai revealed.While the US continues to provoke confrontation, the People's Liberation of Army (PLA) recently resumed a week-long military exercise on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, but Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities in Taiwan seem not to realize the imminent danger. The DPP is deeply divided, he noted. ""They always ask me, 'What will the mainland do?' or 'What should we do?'"" Tsai said.There is a huge divergence of opinion within the DPP, but none to the point of quarreling, said Tsai, adding ""Many DPP members are waiting and observing other members action."" .Tsai told the Global Times that the US has deeply involved in Taiwan Island's political affairs.""Many Taiwan businessmen have a US passport. Before the 2020 Taiwan regional leader election, the CIA contacted many media bosses of the Blue Camp, demanding them to follow US order. As a result, the Blue Camp media changed their stance in the last month,"" he said.The CIA even approached KMT legislators one by one and asked them whether they are anti-US and pro-Communist Party of China, said Tsai, adding that legislators do not have US citizenship, but some of their children may be studying in the US.According to a poll released by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation on Thursday, 41 percent of respondents worry about a cross-straits war, and 58 percent do not.Former Taiwan leader Ma Ying-jeou believes that ""the first battle (between the two sides) will be the last."" Thirty-four percent of respondents echoed Ma's remarks and 58 percent disagreed.Tsai doesn't mince words about his pessimism, arguing that the possibility of a peaceful reunification is diminishing, no matter from the perspective of history, US intervention, de-sinicization and other factors.In his opinion, Trump wants to win more votes by provoking the Chinese mainland, and to persuade voters forget the inefficiency of his administration.""In 1996, missiles were fired (by the mainland) to places very close to Keelung and Kaohsiung,"" he said. ""However, the locations of the (PLA's) military exercises are relatively far away from Taiwan Island with a relatively restrained attitude this year.""Tsai agreed with Ma's recent remarks that ""the first battle will be the last.""If the Chinese mainland decides to deal with the Taiwan question with the armed forces, it will resolve it quickly, Tsai said.""Because it would be like the Chinese mainland showing all the achievements of its military build-up in the past decades in front of the people, and the PLA would not allow the failure of a first battle,"" he added.

"US military tactics over Taiwan exposed as PLA stands readynInfantrymen assigned to a combined arms brigade under the PLA 78th Group Army rush to board infantry fighting vehicles during a tactical training exercise in early August, 2020. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Feng Cheng) The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been holding consecutive, concentrated military drills in all four major Chinese sea regions since mid-August, which is seen as a direct and strong response to the recent negative moves by Taiwan secessionists and the US, but the US military has not restrained its provocations and even bolstered its military operations around the island of Taiwan.These US operations should not be interpreted only as a pure strategic card aimed at provoking and pressuring the Chinese mainland, they also exposed some practical and tactical arrangements of how the US plans to intervene in a possible military conflict between the Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan, Chinese mainland experts said on Monday.The recent US military activities, when put together, have revealed a series of interconnected missions that bring new threats to a potential reunification-by-force operation by the PLA, they pointed out, noting that the PLA can thwart any foreign intervention and stands ready against these challenges should they arise.With the PLA acting as a deterrent, the possibility of a US military intervention remains low, analysts said.On August 17, two US Air Force B-1B bombers took off from Guam and returned to South Dakota. But one of them, instead of flying the shortest return route, flew near the island of Taiwan and into the East China Sea first before leaving, media reported at that time.Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times on Monday that the US bomber intentionally flew a longer route to practice its aerial assault and long-range precision attack capabilities. Equipped with cruise missiles, the B-1B can launch attacks from sea on targets deep in land or on warships.Taking off from Guam, US bombers can play a leading assault role to intervene in the situation in Taiwan, analysts said.The B-1B bombers were not acting alone. Days before their mission, from August 13 to 15, the US military conducted at least seven sorties with multiple types of reconnaissance aircraft, including P-8A and P-3C maritime patrol aircraft and RC-135 and EP-3E reconnaissance aircraft, according to the Beijing-based think tank South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI) on August 15.Additionally, the US also deployed B-2 bombers to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, which conducted joint tactical training on August 18, US military newspaper Stars and Stripes reported on Wednesday.US reconnaissance aircraft sorties near the Chinese mainland and Taiwan island have become increasingly frequent since June, and experts said their mission is likely gathering intelligence on PLA movements, including those on warships, submarines, troop deployments and ballistic missiles.Combining these activities together, Wei said that the US can use such intelligence gathered by its reconnaissance aircraft in guiding its bombers into attack. ""The reconnaissance aircraft are its eyes, and the bombers are its punches,"" he said.Chinese mainland military expert and TV commentator Song Zhongping told the Global Times on Monday that the US could use its bases in Guam in the West Pacific and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean to host bombers for long-range strike missions on the PLA without entering the PLA's air defense zone. File photo taken on Sept. 3, 2015 shows DF-26 missiles attending a military parade in Beijing, capital of China. It has been a big year for China's military as the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is to celebrate its 90th birthday. As Aug. 1, the birthday of the PLA, approaches, the country's army has shown how much its military capacity has grown and how committed it is to maintaining world peace. The PLA has come a long way since its birth during the armed uprising in the city of Nanchang on August 1, 1927, when it had only 20,000 soldiers. Ninety years later, the country boasts 2 million servicemen, according to a national defense white paper titled ""China's Military Strategy,"" published in 2015. Besides the growth in numbers, the PLA has armed its soldiers with world-class equipment. As of June 2017, the Chinese military had participated in 24 UN peacekeeping missions, sending 31,000 personnel, 13 of whom lost their lives in duty. Since 2008, the Navy has dispatched 26 escort task force groups, including more than 70 ships for escort missions in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia. More than 6,300 Chinese and foreign ships have been protected during these missions.

Photo: Xinhua PLA fully prepared While the US military will unlikely engage the Chinese mainland in a military conflict around the time of its presidential election, the PLA needs to be fully prepared for such a scenario, because the US is indeed attempting to use a military approach to contain the Chinese mainland in resolving the Taiwan question, Song said. If a war breaks out in the Taiwan Straits, the PLA is capable of acting fast and leaving no time for the US to come to the secessionists' aid and rescue, the anonymous expert said, noting that the mobilization of forces from the US mainland usually takes more than one week, and US bases in the Asia-Pacific region are all reachable by PLA missiles including the DF-17 and DF-26. Two PLA aircraft carriers, the Liaoning and Shandong, could be deployed east to the island of Taiwan to cut off easy access of US forces to the region, mainland military observers said. The key roles in the exposed US tactics - the bombers that can knock out PLA warships, bases and missiles - will also not succeed in their missions, because they, together with missiles they could have launched, would be intercepted by PLA air defense forces, experts said. ""If the US has this kind of military intention, the PLA should take active defense strategies. This includes enhancing comprehensive defensive capabilities by boosting air defense installations around key military facilities in coastal regions and islands, and using DF series ballistic missiles as tactical and strategic counterattack measures to balance the US' aggressive forces, so the US will need to think twice before acting,"" Wei said.

Some of the PLA weapons that the US feared most are the DF-21D and DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles, which pose a significant threat to large and medium-sized vessels like aircraft carriers. By detecting their positions with specially designed RC-135 aircraft and destroying them with B-1B bombers, the US is hoping to minimize this huge threat, a Chinese mainland military expert told the Global Times on Monday under the condition of anonymity.With US warships safer from PLA attacks, they can approach closer and become capable of attack, the expert said.US warships have also been training near the Chinese mainland and Taiwan island. Since the deployment of the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier in the West Pacific in June, it continuously held exercises in the Philippine Sea, South China Sea and East China Sea, occasionally with the USS Nimitz carrier, and sometimes with Japanese and Australian warships in joint drills, SCSPI said.The USS Mustin destroyer sailed through the Taiwan Straits on August 18, a move analysts said could also be an attempt to gather the latest hydrologic information and PLA deployment intelligence.Song also warned of US military activities not known to the general public. The US' nuclear-powered attack submarines can use cruise missiles to stealthily attack land bases, ports and airfields, and use torpedoes and anti-ship missiles to attack warships, Song said.In the event that the Chinese mainland decides to reunify Taiwan by force, and if the US manages to put these tactics into practice, in a worst-case scenario for the PLA, the US could possibly slow down the PLA's landing and create strategic opportunities for more reinforcements, observers said.

"Taiwan's move on mainland investment aims to please US: analystnTaiwan Photo:VCG The island of Taiwan on Monday said e-commerce platform Taobao Taiwan, established by UK-based Claddagh Venture Investment Ltd, is controlled by Alibaba Group, so it's a Chinese mainland-based investment rather than a foreign one, and it has six months to re-register or leave.The firm was fined NT$410,000 ($13,951) and will need to either withdraw its investment or make rectification in six months, according to the investment commission of Taiwan's Economics Ministry.Taobao Taiwan said it has not yet received an official notification but will actively comply with the government's request as soon as possible, local media reported.The firm added that it respects the resolutions of the ruling, will maintain close contact with the local authority, and make protecting the rights and interests of businesses and consumers its first priority.Re-registering as a Chinese mainland investment would cost Taobao Taiwan more in tax, and its business scope may be restricted as Taiwan treats investment from foreign countries differently than those from the mainland, with far more stringent rules, Dai Shugeng, director of the International Finance Research Office at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Monday.But Dai noted that the overall impact on the firm is quite limited.Taiwan's latest shot against mainland investment comes amid intensified China-US tensions, with Washington cracking down on Chinese tech companies such as Huawei and TikTok.""The island of Taiwan just wants to show the US that it follows its policy closely. It plays well its role of being a pawn, but it may be abandoned if it sticks to this short-sighted policy instead of focusing on lifting up its economy,"" Dai said.The economic affairs authority of Taiwan announced on August 19 that it is tightening regulations to prevent local businesses from distributing video content produced by mainland companies, effective September 3.The notice said Taiwan companies may not provide agency, distribution, or engage in any way with over-the-top television and its intermediaries or related commercial services with groups and individuals from the mainland. Offenders will be fined NT$100,000 to NT$5 million.""The move will only kick out the latest and most advanced technology from the mainland, which brings convenience and cheaper costs to local residents,"" Dai said.The economic development of Taiwan still hinges on its ties with the mainland, said analysts, noting that only through cooperation can the two achieve win-win outcomes as the coronavirus pandemic is hindering the economic recovery of most countries.Global Times "	8/24/20	0	0	0.7899	1
"US military tactics over Taiwan exposed as PLA stands readynInfantrymen assigned to a combined arms brigade under the PLA 78th Group Army rush to board infantry fighting vehicles during a tactical training exercise in early August, 2020. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Feng Cheng) The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been holding consecutive, concentrated military drills in all four major Chinese sea regions since mid-August, which is seen as a direct and strong response to the recent negative moves by Taiwan secessionists and the US, but the US military has not restrained its provocations and even bolstered its military operations around the island of Taiwan.These US operations should not be interpreted only as a pure strategic card aimed at provoking and pressuring the Chinese mainland, they also exposed some practical and tactical arrangements of how the US plans to intervene in a possible military conflict between the Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan, Chinese mainland experts said on Monday.The recent US military activities, when put together, have revealed a series of interconnected missions that bring new threats to a potential reunification-by-force operation by the PLA, they pointed out, noting that the PLA can thwart any foreign intervention and stands ready against these challenges should they arise.With the PLA acting as a deterrent, the possibility of a US military intervention remains low, analysts said.On August 17, two US Air Force B-1B bombers took off from Guam and returned to South Dakota. But one of them, instead of flying the shortest return route, flew near the island of Taiwan and into the East China Sea first before leaving, media reported at that time.Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times on Monday that the US bomber intentionally flew a longer route to practice its aerial assault and long-range precision attack capabilities. Equipped with cruise missiles, the B-1B can launch attacks from sea on targets deep in land or on warships.Taking off from Guam, US bombers can play a leading assault role to intervene in the situation in Taiwan, analysts said.The B-1B bombers were not acting alone. Days before their mission, from August 13 to 15, the US military conducted at least seven sorties with multiple types of reconnaissance aircraft, including P-8A and P-3C maritime patrol aircraft and RC-135 and EP-3E reconnaissance aircraft, according to the Beijing-based think tank South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI) on August 15.Additionally, the US also deployed B-2 bombers to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, which conducted joint tactical training on August 18, US military newspaper Stars and Stripes reported on Wednesday.US reconnaissance aircraft sorties near the Chinese mainland and Taiwan island have become increasingly frequent since June, and experts said their mission is likely gathering intelligence on PLA movements, including those on warships, submarines, troop deployments and ballistic missiles.Combining these activities together, Wei said that the US can use such intelligence gathered by its reconnaissance aircraft in guiding its bombers into attack. ""The reconnaissance aircraft are its eyes, and the bombers are its punches,"" he said.Chinese mainland military expert and TV commentator Song Zhongping told the Global Times on Monday that the US could use its bases in Guam in the West Pacific and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean to host bombers for long-range strike missions on the PLA without entering the PLA's air defense zone. File photo taken on Sept. 3, 2015 shows DF-26 missiles attending a military parade in Beijing, capital of China. It has been a big year for China's military as the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is to celebrate its 90th birthday. As Aug. 1, the birthday of the PLA, approaches, the country's army has shown how much its military capacity has grown and how committed it is to maintaining world peace. The PLA has come a long way since its birth during the armed uprising in the city of Nanchang on August 1, 1927, when it had only 20,000 soldiers. Ninety years later, the country boasts 2 million servicemen, according to a national defense white paper titled ""China's Military Strategy,"" published in 2015. Besides the growth in numbers, the PLA has armed its soldiers with world-class equipment. As of June 2017, the Chinese military had participated in 24 UN peacekeeping missions, sending 31,000 personnel, 13 of whom lost their lives in duty. Since 2008, the Navy has dispatched 26 escort task force groups, including more than 70 ships for escort missions in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia. More than 6,300 Chinese and foreign ships have been protected during these missions.

Photo: Xinhua PLA fully prepared While the US military will unlikely engage the Chinese mainland in a military conflict around the time of its presidential election, the PLA needs to be fully prepared for such a scenario, because the US is indeed attempting to use a military approach to contain the Chinese mainland in resolving the Taiwan question, Song said. If a war breaks out in the Taiwan Straits, the PLA is capable of acting fast and leaving no time for the US to come to the secessionists' aid and rescue, the anonymous expert said, noting that the mobilization of forces from the US mainland usually takes more than one week, and US bases in the Asia-Pacific region are all reachable by PLA missiles including the DF-17 and DF-26. Two PLA aircraft carriers, the Liaoning and Shandong, could be deployed east to the island of Taiwan to cut off easy access of US forces to the region, mainland military observers said. The key roles in the exposed US tactics - the bombers that can knock out PLA warships, bases and missiles - will also not succeed in their missions, because they, together with missiles they could have launched, would be intercepted by PLA air defense forces, experts said. ""If the US has this kind of military intention, the PLA should take active defense strategies. This includes enhancing comprehensive defensive capabilities by boosting air defense installations around key military facilities in coastal regions and islands, and using DF series ballistic missiles as tactical and strategic counterattack measures to balance the US' aggressive forces, so the US will need to think twice before acting,"" Wei said.

Some of the PLA weapons that the US feared most are the DF-21D and DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles, which pose a significant threat to large and medium-sized vessels like aircraft carriers. By detecting their positions with specially designed RC-135 aircraft and destroying them with B-1B bombers, the US is hoping to minimize this huge threat, a Chinese mainland military expert told the Global Times on Monday under the condition of anonymity.With US warships safer from PLA attacks, they can approach closer and become capable of attack, the expert said.US warships have also been training near the Chinese mainland and Taiwan island. Since the deployment of the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier in the West Pacific in June, it continuously held exercises in the Philippine Sea, South China Sea and East China Sea, occasionally with the USS Nimitz carrier, and sometimes with Japanese and Australian warships in joint drills, SCSPI said.The USS Mustin destroyer sailed through the Taiwan Straits on August 18, a move analysts said could also be an attempt to gather the latest hydrologic information and PLA deployment intelligence.Song also warned of US military activities not known to the general public. The US' nuclear-powered attack submarines can use cruise missiles to stealthily attack land bases, ports and airfields, and use torpedoes and anti-ship missiles to attack warships, Song said.In the event that the Chinese mainland decides to reunify Taiwan by force, and if the US manages to put these tactics into practice, in a worst-case scenario for the PLA, the US could possibly slow down the PLA's landing and create strategic opportunities for more reinforcements, observers said.

"'Not firing 1st shot' principle necessary to manage cross-Straits situationnTwo Su-35 fighter jets and a H-6K bomber fly in formation on May 11, 2018. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) air force conducted patrol training over China's island of Taiwan on Friday. Su-35 fighter jets flew over the Bashi Channel in formation with the H-6Ks for the first time, which marks a new breakthrough in island patrol patterns, said Shen Jinke, spokesperson for the PLA air force.Photo:China Military Some people have accused me of being weak because I advocated that the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the US military and military of Taiwan island should all abide by the principle of ""not firing the first shot"" amid these sensitive and tense days.Some have interpreted my words out of context to use them attacking me. Some see war as a simple matter, without realizing that a war is about casualties, destruction of cities and people suffering - it is nothing like watching a war movie. They are also ignorant that war is only a last resort.The current situation across the Taiwan Straits is very tense. The situation on the frontline is becoming more complicated with risk of miscalculation increasing. All sides applying principle of ""not firing the first shot"" is a necessary constraint in order to prevent accidentally triggering a war.By saying ""not firing the first shot,"" I do not mean that Beijing would tie its hands when separatist forces cross a redline. Adopting non-peaceful means to prevent ""Taiwan secession"" should be another discussion. The Democratic Progressive Party authorities will definitely face a military strike from the Chinese mainland if it misinterprets the situation and develops any official relations with the US that is prohibited by the Anti-Secession Law. If the situation turns into an all-out war, the separatists' criminals would either be eradicated or eventually brought to trial on the mainland.It is wrong for some people to say that it's useless that the PLA only conducts exercises, but takes no real action. One function of the military is to deter, and the best way to win a confrontation is to subdue the enemy without a fight. Both the PLA drills and its encirclement sortie around Taiwan island have made a difference by repeatedly stressing the bottom line set by the Anti-Secession Law.The Taiwan local authorities are clear that the PLA will immediately attack the island if they cross the redline. They have been playing the ""salami slicing"" tactic just to avoid a devastating punishment. But the PLA's recent exercises aim to dispel any illusion that such a tactic might materialize these secessionists' ultimate goal of ""Taiwan secession.""Now the Chinese mainland, the US, and the island of Taiwan do not want an immediate showdown at the current stage where the three sides step up game and compete with willpower. At such point, a war could break out unexpectedly if a gun goes off accidentally. This would mean a high degree of uncertainty. An emphasis on the principle of ""not firing the first shot"" by three sides will certainly help to manage the situation.However, the situation might be out of control if tensions keep escalating, making the risks for war grow higher and higher.The Chinese mainland must be fully prepared for the worst. We surely do not want a war to break out now. But we should be the one that is least afraid of the situation spiraling out of control as we are defending the territorial integrity of our country and the one-China principle, which is recognized by the whole world. If increasing provocations by the island of Taiwan and the US eventually lead to a breakout, then China will have no choice but to resolutely fight a just war.The author is editor-in-chief of the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	8/24/20	1	1	-0.9952	-1
"Taiwan an 'exporter' of COVID-19nTaiwan Photo:Xinhua Netizens and media outlets in Taiwan who called the island an ""exporter"" of COVID-19 cases said the ""epidemic control myth"" of the island that has been boasted by the Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has turned to a broken dream, after several countries and regions have reported confirmed cases from the island.So far, Thailand, Japan, Laos, Malaysia and Vietnam, have reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the island, and Hong Kong and Shanghai also reported confirmed cases from the island. A total of seven cases have been exported to these countries and cities since June 20, Taiwan media reported.Chinese analysts said it showed loopholes in the island's epidemic control despite DPP's boast, and Taiwan will face a worse epidemic situation if DPP continues its political games.The first case reported from Taiwan involved a Japanese student who returned to Japan from the island on June 20, and later tested positive for the coronavirus. A Thai national who worked in Taoyuan was then diagnosed on July 27 after returning to Thailand. Graphic:GT However, Taiwan's health department head Chen Shih-chung stressed that the positive rate among Taiwan travelers detected overseas was quite low--that is, only 0.008 percent, chinatimes.com reported on Thursday.""It reveals the authorities' arrogance over the results of epidemic prevention. If Taiwan does not come up with specific measures, it may sooner or later become 'an exporter of COVID-19' that will draw criticism,"" chinatimes.com commented.Moreover, Taiwan authorities have been refusing to carry out widespread COVID-19 screening among local residents to prevent coronavirus spread, which some media considers a trick to avoid any negative effects on public polls and the popularity of Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen.These cases from Taiwan show that there are still loopholes in the epidemic control strategy of Taiwan, although the authorities have been boasting it is a ""excellent student"" in epidemic control, Yang Lixian, a research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center of Cross-Straits Relations, told the Global Times on Friday.""If they don't fix loopholes in their operations, there will be greater problems,"" Yang said.Yang believes that island and the US flatter each other in COVID-19 measures to fight the Chinese mainland.""However, facts speak louder than words, and the authorities are slapping themselves on the face,"" Yang said.Some Taiwan netizens said the authorities had been making excuses and denying the possibility of a surge in local infections.

"DPP authorities must act to reduce risks of war: Global Times editorialnIllustration: Xia Qing/GT The situation in the Taiwan Straits and the South China Sea is getting increasingly tense. According to data from overseas media outlets, US military planes have flied to the South China Sea 67 times in a month. The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) started military exercises in the Yellow Sea on Saturday, following its just-concluded military drills in the Taiwan Straits. The PLA will also conduct military exercises in the South China Sea and the Bohai Sea on Monday. There have been increasing discussions on the risk of military conflicts.The situation in the Taiwan Straits is the most delicate. In the South China Sea, the US is conducting unilateral military provocation, but China and other regional claimants have a clear attitude about the need to prevent military frictions. But in the Taiwan Straits, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities are making radical and active moves. Political and military issues are intertwined in the Straits, stimulating each other.Territorial disputes in the South China Sea have been controlled properly. But Taiwan secessionism is still uncertain and could get out of control. The US strategy of containing China is the main cause of tension in the Western Pacific. The strategy has garnered limited coordination around the South China Sea, but it has won full support of DPP authorities. This makes the situation in the Taiwan Straits potentially more explosive.There have been two extreme unstable factors in the cross-Straits situation in recent years. First, DPP authorities refuse to recognize the 1992 Consensus and have proactively promoted so-called de-sinicization. Second, the US' strategy has been to interfere in and suppress China by creating tensions in China's periphery. The two factors are more and more intertwined, seriously threatening China's national security and peace of the entire region.Tensions in the Western Pacific region, especially in the Taiwan Straits, are in a downward spiral. There is no mutual trust between the Chinese mainland and the US or the island of Taiwan. Vigilance and hostility dominate their relations and the situation is becoming increasingly hard to control.There is certain distance before there is a real possibility of an outbreak of war, but the risks are approaching. Relevant parties are getting prepared for the possible combat, friction points are increasing.History shows that wars often break out not because someone wants to fight, but because parties are unable to resolve their hostilities and therefore prepared for the worst. And the worst-case scenario arrives abruptly at a certain point due to mutual misjudgments.The Chinese mainland, the US and the island of Taiwan should all make efforts to ease tensions across the Straits. Since no one wants war, they should show their goodwill to promote peace.The current round of change in the status quo in the Taiwan Straits stems from Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen and the DPP authorities' assuming power and their fundamental changes to Taiwan's cross-Straits policies. They shoulder the special responsibility for the ongoing tensions in the Straits.During the era of former Taiwan leader Chen Shui-bian, the China-US relationship was much better than today. Beijing and Washington kept relatively strong communications capabilities, and Washington to some extent played a role which cooled the tensions in the Straits. Now it is the opposite. Washington has become the instigator of the radical moves of the Taiwan authorities. The US is trying to contain China by leveraging the Taiwan Straits. It is finding fault with China by hyping the Taiwan question, which reflects its overall suppression of China.The Tsai-led authorities should call a halt right now, both tactically and strategically. If the situation around the Taiwan Straits does not cool down, military tensions will inevitably intensify, and the risk of a war may not be decided by anybody. The utilitarianism adopted by DPP authorities has almost overwhelmed everything, making them turn a blind eye to the risk of a war.The Chinese mainland does not hope a war breaks out in the Taiwan Straits at this juncture. The bottom line of the mainland is clear and has never changed.The current danger is that DPP authorities and the US keep ratcheting up their actions and eroding the mainland's bottom line with ""salami slicing"" tactics. The Taiwan authorities continually step on the bottom line under the banner of democracy, and the US constantly violates the ""one-China"" principle it has acknowledged in a bid to pressurize China. The two are dancing to the same tune to challenge the Chinese mainland.Should a hot war break out, the DPP authorities will be bound to step down or even collapse. If the war turns into a comprehensive one, the DPP leaders who have committed heinous crimes will either be wiped out in the war or sent to the mainland and brought to justice. Taiwan's ""defense authorities"" boast their abilities and resolution in a war, which is self-deceiving. If Taiwan authorities indulge in such fantasies and push the situation into a military showdown, they will only confront these self-made tragedies in the future. "	8/23/20	0	0	-0.9959	-1

(eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Li Shilong) Continued US provocations The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has announced four concentrated military drills across three major Chinese sea regions in the coming days, following a recent announcement of consecutive, realistic drills in the Taiwan Straits and at its north and south ends aimed at deterring Taiwan secessionists and the US.Pressing the island of Taiwan from both the north and south ends, the simultaneous exercises in the South China Sea, the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea will demonstrate the PLA's high level of combat preparedness, Chinese mainland military experts said on Sunday.The drills are expected to hone in on the PLA troops' cross-regional joint combat capability, because if military conflicts break out, they will not likely be restricted to one sea region, but interconnected, they said.According to a navigation restriction notice released by the local maritime safety administration in Guangzhou on Sunday, the PLA will hold military exercises in the waters of the South China Sea, off the southeast coast of South China's Guangdong Province, from Monday to Saturday.Also in the South China Sea, military drills will be held in waters off Hainan Island's southeast coast, also from Monday to Saturday, the Hainan Maritime Safety Administration announced on Friday.In the Yellow Sea north of the island of Taiwan and the East China Sea, the PLA is holding large-scale, live-fire exercises from Saturday to Wednesday in a vast region of waters east of Qingdao, East China's Shandong Province, and Lianyungang, East China's Jiangsu Province, said a notice issued by PLA Unit 91208 and local maritime authorities on Friday.Additionally, live-fire drills will also be held in the Bohai Sea in a fan-shaped area from Monday to September 30, the Tangshan Maritime Safety Administration announced on Friday.The four simultaneous military drills in three major Chinese sea regions mean the island of Taiwan will be hemmed in by PLA exercises from both the north and the south, and taking into account the drills in the Taiwan Straits and at its north and south ends announced on August 13, the PLA is conducting major exercises in all of its four major sea regions with Taiwan in mind in August, analysts said.The announcements did not provide further details regarding the drills.Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday that the drills are likely to feature anti-ship, air defense and anti-submarine exercises.The drills could also be joint exercises that feature multiple military branches based in different regions of the country, Song said, noting that this could mean that these exercises could be linked to the recent consecutive, realistic drills in the Taiwan Straits.In addition to the PLA Navy, other forces like the PLA Army, Air Force, Rocket Force and Strategic Support Force could also be involved, analysts predicted.The PLA should not prepare for battle in just the East China Sea and the Taiwan Straits, but in all Chinese sea regions, because the goal of these drills should be joint operations, and troops from Northern, Eastern and Southern Theater Commands should be capable of cross-regional joint combat, Song said.If military conflicts in the Taiwan Straits break out, they will not likely be restricted to one sea region, but interconnected, Song stressed.Chinese mainland analysts said that the PLA drills will not only demonstrate capabilities and act as a deterrence, but also give strong responses to recent US military activities in the Taiwan Straits.Even after the PLA's drills in the Taiwan Straits, the US continued to send warplanes and warships to the area, including the USS Mustin destroyer that sailed through the Taiwan Straits on Tuesday and multiple types of reconnaissance aircraft and B-1B bombers that flied near the island over the past week.Additionally, the US Pacific Air Forces sent four B-1 bombers and two B-2 bombers in simultaneous missions on Tuesday in the Sea of Japan and the Indian Ocean, with some aircraft coordinating with the USS Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group near Japan at one point, US military newspaper Stars and Stripes reported on Wednesday.It is also very rare for the PLA to announce so many drills in such a short period of time. While the PLA conducts frequent, routine exercises according to schedule, many of them are usually not revealed to the general public, analysts said. The concentrated announcements can be seen as a strong signal, they noted.Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, told the Global Times on Sunday that the concentrated PLA drills could serve as further warnings to Taiwan secessionists and the US, and show that the PLA is prepared and capable of effectively safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity in all sea regions.While the East China Sea would become the main battlefield in a possible reunification-by-force operation, the South China Sea and the Yellow Sea will likely also become involved. The drills in the Bohai Sea might involve the testing of new missiles, Li estimated.The PLA drills are expected to be real combat-oriented, including how the maritime battle would flow, what kind of challenges might occur, and what actions the militaries of the island and the US might take, Li said, noting that Taiwan secessionists and the US should not have any illusion that their provocative actions hitting below the Chinese mainland's bottom line can succeed.

"To American politicians, Taiwan is a tradable pawnnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT A resolution introduced by US Senator Martha McSally and co-sponsored by Senator Marsha Blackburn calls on China to repay US bondholders more than $1.6 trillion of sovereign debt. A House measure led by Republican Mark Green is also reportedly forthcoming. Voice of America cited US analysts saying that as long as the US acknowledges the ""one-China"" policy, Beijing is the sole successor of the debts of the Republic of China.The bonds were issued in 1912 by the Republic of China, whose government and forces fled to Taiwan in 1949.The basis of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the US is US acknowledgement of the ""one-China"" principle. But as China-US competition intensifies, the Taiwan question has increasingly been politicized by Washington and played as a leverage to challenge China. By asking China to repay the debt, these US politicians delivered this message: For the US, the Taiwan question is tradable and if Beijing pays, they will stop pestering over it.The mentality of US politicians toward China-US relations as traders is fully exposed. They also expose themselves to the world, including the island of Taiwan, that they will only treat their so-called pledge to Taiwan as nothing but a deal.In recent years, the US Congress has passed several Taiwan-related acts which presumably support Taiwan, for instance the Taiwan Travel Act of 2018, the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018, the Taiwan Assurance Act of 2019 and the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative Act of 2019. The National Defense Authorization Act of recent years also highlights US support for the development of Taiwan's military.For Taiwan, these acts are like poisonous drinks to quench its thirst, but the US will never provide the security guarantee Taiwan desires. A study by the US Quincy Institute in June found that Taiwan funded some US think tanks so that they would produce policy papers urging closer US ties with Taiwan that are in favor of Taiwan authorities. That is how those ""Taiwan friendly"" acts came into being, and Taiwan should not expect the US to take these acts seriously.In his memoir The Room Where It Happened released in June, former national security advisor John Bolton predicts that Taiwan is the next place Trump will drop after his abandonment of the Kurds.As early as 2011, Paul V. Kane, a former international security fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, writing in The New York Times, urged then president Barack Obama to ditch Taiwan to save the US economy. He suggested the US end military assistance and arms sales to Taiwan in exchange for China writing off the $1.14 trillion of American debt.Obviously, the idea that Taiwan can be traded has always been on the minds of US politicians. Taiwan is a useful chess piece for the US only because of the US strategy to suppress the Chinese mainland. On the one hand, Washington exploits the Taiwan question to contain China, on the other hand it is inciting tensions and making money by selling arms to Taiwan.Taiwan for the US is only a tradable chess piece, but for the mainland, reunification of the mainland and Taiwan is priceless.

"Former Taiwan regional leader defends criticism of DPP’s US-leaning policy following pledge to prevent war with mainlandnMa Ying-jeou The former leader of Taiwan island, Ma Ying-jeou, said his Saturday criticism toward the current Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration that the latter is pushing the island toward the verge of war was spot on, after its current leader, Tsai Ying-wen, fired criticism at him for his earlier remarks.Ma, of the Kuomintang (KMT), gave the speech at a forum on Saturday morning, during which he said he will strive to prevent war between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan from now until the day he dies, amid an escalation in cross-Straits tensions in recent days.Ma said that the people will suffer if war breaks out, and the regional leader of Taiwan should not even think of how people will suffer, but should prevent a war from happening.The former regional leader also pointed out that Taiwan is leading itself into a perilous situation due to the Tsai Ing-wen's administration's pursuit of a policy that slants heavily toward the US and antagonizes the mainland.Ma's remark was attacked by the Tsai's administration later, who said that his remark has deviated from reality and it is confusing how Ma used war to threaten people in Taiwan.Ma responded to the criticism on Saturday afternoon, saying that the fiery criticism he received means that his remarks were spot on, and that he welcomes such criticism, as it is the only way to bring the neglected topic back into the sunshine.Ma said that reunification is a process that should not be realized in the blink of an eye. China has a history of over 4,000 years, and the country remained unified for 70 percent of the time. There have always been wars from unification to separation, but we need to solve the dispute in a peaceful matter, said Ma, pointing out that the 1992 consensus is a good tool with which to realize such a goal, said Ma, according to media reports.Ma stressed that it is important for people across the Straits to treat each other with sincerity, adding that the island of Taiwan has made its own missteps, and the Chinese mainland is dissatisfied with Taiwan on certain matters. But Chinese people across the Straits should prove to their ancestors that preventing a war is what Taiwan's regional leader should do.According to Taiwan media reports, Ma said earlier this month at a speech that if the Chinese mainland decides to reunify the island by force, ""the first battle is the last battle,"" and the US military will not come to the island's rescue, and that there won't be time for the US to come either.Global Times "	8/23/20	0	0	-0.9957	-1

(eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Li Shilong) Continued US provocations The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has announced four concentrated military drills across three major Chinese sea regions in the coming days, following a recent announcement of consecutive, realistic drills in the Taiwan Straits and at its north and south ends aimed at deterring Taiwan secessionists and the US.Pressing the island of Taiwan from both the north and south ends, the simultaneous exercises in the South China Sea, the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea will demonstrate the PLA's high level of combat preparedness, Chinese mainland military experts said on Sunday.The drills are expected to hone in on the PLA troops' cross-regional joint combat capability, because if military conflicts break out, they will not likely be restricted to one sea region, but interconnected, they said.According to a navigation restriction notice released by the local maritime safety administration in Guangzhou on Sunday, the PLA will hold military exercises in the waters of the South China Sea, off the southeast coast of South China's Guangdong Province, from Monday to Saturday.Also in the South China Sea, military drills will be held in waters off Hainan Island's southeast coast, also from Monday to Saturday, the Hainan Maritime Safety Administration announced on Friday.In the Yellow Sea north of the island of Taiwan and the East China Sea, the PLA is holding large-scale, live-fire exercises from Saturday to Wednesday in a vast region of waters east of Qingdao, East China's Shandong Province, and Lianyungang, East China's Jiangsu Province, said a notice issued by PLA Unit 91208 and local maritime authorities on Friday.Additionally, live-fire drills will also be held in the Bohai Sea in a fan-shaped area from Monday to September 30, the Tangshan Maritime Safety Administration announced on Friday.The four simultaneous military drills in three major Chinese sea regions mean the island of Taiwan will be hemmed in by PLA exercises from both the north and the south, and taking into account the drills in the Taiwan Straits and at its north and south ends announced on August 13, the PLA is conducting major exercises in all of its four major sea regions with Taiwan in mind in August, analysts said.The announcements did not provide further details regarding the drills.Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday that the drills are likely to feature anti-ship, air defense and anti-submarine exercises.The drills could also be joint exercises that feature multiple military branches based in different regions of the country, Song said, noting that this could mean that these exercises could be linked to the recent consecutive, realistic drills in the Taiwan Straits.In addition to the PLA Navy, other forces like the PLA Army, Air Force, Rocket Force and Strategic Support Force could also be involved, analysts predicted.The PLA should not prepare for battle in just the East China Sea and the Taiwan Straits, but in all Chinese sea regions, because the goal of these drills should be joint operations, and troops from Northern, Eastern and Southern Theater Commands should be capable of cross-regional joint combat, Song said.If military conflicts in the Taiwan Straits break out, they will not likely be restricted to one sea region, but interconnected, Song stressed.Chinese mainland analysts said that the PLA drills will not only demonstrate capabilities and act as a deterrence, but also give strong responses to recent US military activities in the Taiwan Straits.Even after the PLA's drills in the Taiwan Straits, the US continued to send warplanes and warships to the area, including the USS Mustin destroyer that sailed through the Taiwan Straits on Tuesday and multiple types of reconnaissance aircraft and B-1B bombers that flied near the island over the past week.Additionally, the US Pacific Air Forces sent four B-1 bombers and two B-2 bombers in simultaneous missions on Tuesday in the Sea of Japan and the Indian Ocean, with some aircraft coordinating with the USS Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group near Japan at one point, US military newspaper Stars and Stripes reported on Wednesday.It is also very rare for the PLA to announce so many drills in such a short period of time. While the PLA conducts frequent, routine exercises according to schedule, many of them are usually not revealed to the general public, analysts said. The concentrated announcements can be seen as a strong signal, they noted.Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, told the Global Times on Sunday that the concentrated PLA drills could serve as further warnings to Taiwan secessionists and the US, and show that the PLA is prepared and capable of effectively safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity in all sea regions.While the East China Sea would become the main battlefield in a possible reunification-by-force operation, the South China Sea and the Yellow Sea will likely also become involved. The drills in the Bohai Sea might involve the testing of new missiles, Li estimated.The PLA drills are expected to be real combat-oriented, including how the maritime battle would flow, what kind of challenges might occur, and what actions the militaries of the island and the US might take, Li said, noting that Taiwan secessionists and the US should not have any illusion that their provocative actions hitting below the Chinese mainland's bottom line can succeed.

"Taiwan an 'exporter' of COVID-19nTaiwan Photo:Xinhua Netizens and media outlets in Taiwan who called the island an ""exporter"" of COVID-19 cases said the ""epidemic control myth"" of the island that has been boasted by the Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has turned to a broken dream, after several countries and regions have reported confirmed cases from the island.So far, Thailand, Japan, Laos, Malaysia and Vietnam, have reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the island, and Hong Kong and Shanghai also reported confirmed cases from the island. A total of seven cases have been exported to these countries and cities since June 20, Taiwan media reported.Chinese analysts said it showed loopholes in the island's epidemic control despite DPP's boast, and Taiwan will face a worse epidemic situation if DPP continues its political games.The first case reported from Taiwan involved a Japanese student who returned to Japan from the island on June 20, and later tested positive for the coronavirus. A Thai national who worked in Taoyuan was then diagnosed on July 27 after returning to Thailand. Graphic:GT However, Taiwan's health department head Chen Shih-chung stressed that the positive rate among Taiwan travelers detected overseas was quite low--that is, only 0.008 percent, chinatimes.com reported on Thursday.""It reveals the authorities' arrogance over the results of epidemic prevention. If Taiwan does not come up with specific measures, it may sooner or later become 'an exporter of COVID-19' that will draw criticism,"" chinatimes.com commented.Moreover, Taiwan authorities have been refusing to carry out widespread COVID-19 screening among local residents to prevent coronavirus spread, which some media considers a trick to avoid any negative effects on public polls and the popularity of Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen.These cases from Taiwan show that there are still loopholes in the epidemic control strategy of Taiwan, although the authorities have been boasting it is a ""excellent student"" in epidemic control, Yang Lixian, a research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center of Cross-Straits Relations, told the Global Times on Friday.""If they don't fix loopholes in their operations, there will be greater problems,"" Yang said.Yang believes that island and the US flatter each other in COVID-19 measures to fight the Chinese mainland.""However, facts speak louder than words, and the authorities are slapping themselves on the face,"" Yang said.Some Taiwan netizens said the authorities had been making excuses and denying the possibility of a surge in local infections.

"Taiwan companies not leaving the mainland: insidersnWorkers are seen at a workshop in Longhua science and technology park of Foxconn Technology Group in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Province, Feb 22, 2019. (Xinhua/Mao Siqian) Business representatives from the island of Taiwan and the Chinese mainland said the island leader's claim that Taiwan companies are leaving the mainland is a ""hoax"".It seems the Taiwan authorities aspire to decouple from the Chinese mainland to echo a decoupling drive by the US Trump administration.Henry Tho Kee-ping, chairman of Giant Kunshan Light Metal Technology Co, told the Global Times in a recent interview that claims that many Taiwan-based enterprises were moving out of the mainland were just a political lie made by the Democratic Progressive Party of Taiwan.Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen claimed at the end of 2019 that Taiwan companies investing in the mainland were leaving and coming back to the island. She even claimed NT$700 billion ($23 billion) investment by Taiwan companies was leaving. Her claim was soon denied by the island's economic affairs department which said the amount of investment leaving the mainland was ""zero"", according to Taiwan local media.It's impossible for Taiwan companies to move back to the island or Southeast Asian countries just because the mainland market is huge, analysts say.As global supply chains reshuffle, some Taiwan companies could move to divest some of their assets in the mainland.Taiwan-based Catcher Technology, a supplier to Apple Inc, said in a filing Tuesday that it agreed to sell two units in the Chinese mainland to Hunan Province-based Lens Technology Co for $1.43 billion.Last month, Wistron, an iPhone assembler, agreed to sell two of its factories in the mainland to fast-growing Chinese manufacturer Luxshare Precision Industry Co for 3.3 billion yuan ($477 million).However, a complete withdrawal of Taiwan companies from the mainland market is untrue, industry observers told the Global Times Wednesday.Wu Jiaying, chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen's Association in Xiamen, Fujian Province, said that a tiny number of Taiwan companies are considering moving out of the mainland to other markets. ""But that is not the trend and cannot truly reflect the whole picture, which is, more firms from Taiwan are investing more in the mainland"".Data from the Taiwan Businessmen's Association in Xiamen showed that in the January-July period, incremental investment from Taiwan companies increased 48.6 percent year-on-year to reach 13 billion yuan.""A few optoelectronics enterprises have visited the association to seek investment opportunities in Xiamen and Zhanjiang [South China's Guangdong Province],"" said Wu.Compared with immature Southeast Asian manufacturing markets, the mainland still represents an ideal place for Taiwan companies thanks to the hard-working and skilled labor force, relatively inexpensive land cost and efficient management in the mainland, according to Wu.According to official data in July, Taiwan Island's non-financial foreign direct investment (FDI) in the mainland dropped 54 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of the year to $510 million, because of the Covid-19 outbreak. Cumulative investment from the island accounted for 3.2 percent of the mainland's total FDI as of March 2020, with a total value hitting $69.66 billion. "	8/19/20	0	0	0.9682	1
"Taiwan's ban on mainland net TV service aimed at pleasing US: observersniQIYI Photo: cnsphoto The island of Taiwan is moving to ban Chinese mainland video streaming services of Tencent and Baidu's iQIYI, which observers said is to butter up to the US to encircle mainland tech companies. However, targeting the platforms welcome in the island is technologically impossible and won't have an impact.The economic affairs authority of Taiwan announced on Tuesday night that it is tightening regulations to prevent local businesses from distributing video content produced by mainland companies, effective September 3.The notice says that Taiwan companies are not allowed to provide agency, distribution, or engage in any way with over-the-top television (OTT-TV) and its intermediaries or related commercial services with groups and individuals from the mainland. Offenders will be fined from NT$100,000 ($3,403) to NT$5 million.Video streamers from the mainland had been banned from offering video streaming in Taiwan, but Tencent and iQIYI managed to avoid those restrictions by partnering with local companies.""Like Netflix, iQIYI is listed on Nasdaq, and the download path of the two platforms is the same, so it should be regarded as an international company rather than a mainland company, but it was portrayed by Taiwan politicians as an enemy,"" Mike Hsieh, a Taiwan resident close to the media industry, told the Global Times.He noted that it is shameful double standards to revise the law against mainland companies, whose influence will not be impaired or ignored in this way.We offer plenty of drama, film, variety, animation and children's materials, but no news or political commentary. It's purely an entertainment platform, completely free of politics, and our users can vouch for that, Fan Li-da, head of iQIYI's agent in Taiwan, told local media.Some experts speculated the move by the Taiwan authority is meant to please Washington, which is cracking down on Chinese tech companies and creating trouble through political manipulation.But observers said Taiwan is thinking too high of itself, as it is a very small market. Whether or not the two companies can continue operating in Taiwan is not really important for them, observers added.""People in Taiwan enjoy using mainland platforms and watching mainland TV dramas, but they cannot watch them on TV - only through OTT-TV,"" Xiang Ligang, an industry analyst, told the Global Times, noting that there are many similar businesses in Taiwan, most of which enter the market through agents without breaking the law.iQIYI is the most popular mainland streaming platform in Taiwan, with over 3 million users on the island, media reported.

"PLA sends stern warning to US warship for transit in Taiwan StraitsnArmored vehicles mounted with Tor anti-aircraft missile systems attached to an air defense brigade under the PLA Eastern Theater Command fire at mock aerial targets during a whole-process live-fire test in northwestern China's Gobi desert on July 26, 2020. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Wang Wenzhou) The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command said Wednesday it sent naval and air forces to track and monitor the movements of the USS Mustin destroyer as it sailed through the Taiwan Straits on Tuesday and warned the US against making frequent negative moves on the Taiwan question.Chinese mainland analysts noted that the command made a similar statement last week without directly pointing at the US, but the latest response calling out the US shows that the PLA is warning the US that there will be a day when it will ""settle the matter"" with the US side.The US warship was likely closely watched by PLA warships, warplanes and radar, and would be stopped if it crosses the red line, experts also said.The US has been continuously making negative moves on the Taiwan question, which has sent the wrong signal to ""Taiwan independence"" forces, and severely threatened the peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, said Senior Colonel Zhang Chunhui, the spokesperson of the PLA Eastern Theater Command.Zhang made the comment after the US Pacific Fleet said on Tuesday that the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer ""conducted a routine Taiwan Straits transit"" on Tuesday. It said there have been 10 US warship transits in the Taiwan Straits this year. Media on the island of Taiwan reported on Wednesday that the US warship sailed on the western side of the ""middle line"" of the Taiwan Straits, which is closer to the Chinese mainland than Taiwan island.""We sternly warn related parties that any statement and act that sabotages the one-China principle and stirs up trouble in the Taiwan Straits does not fit the fundamental interests of China and the US, and damages the well-being of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, as it brings a real threat to peace and stability in the region, which is very dangerous,"" Zhang said.Analysts believed the warning is one of the most stern ever sent by the PLA, and the ""real threat"" noted by the PLA spokesperson means the Chinese military considered the US latest move very serious.Chinese mainland military expert Song Zhongping told the Global Times on Wednesday that the ""real threat"" means the US has normalized warship transits in the Taiwan Straits and crossed into the mainland side. This would increase the risk of collisions, and even an accidental conflict.If a military conflict breaks out between China and the US, the PLA needs to be prepared in the South China Sea and East China Sea, because such a conflict will very likely not be limited to one region, but a wider one, Song said, stressing this is why China and the US should not engage in a war.The Nanjing, a PLA Navy Type 052D destroyer, was spotted following the US ship, Taiwan media reported.In addition to one or more warships, the PLA also likely sent warplanes, possibly including early warning aircraft, special mission aircraft, reconnaissance drones and fighter jets, to monitor the US warship's movements, a Chinese mainland military expert who asked not to be named told the Global Times on Wednesday.The PLA also likely organized many of its surveillance capabilities, including radar installations and satellites, to track the US warship. And in case it crosses the red line, like trespassing into Chinese territorial waters, an immediate response would include measures to expel it, the expert said. He said that a US warship in the Taiwan Straits is like a rat in a hole that is easy to catch, as the PLA's concentrated surveillance on it means all kinds of anti-ship weapons can be sent there, if necessary.Xu Guangyu, a senior adviser to the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told the Global Times previously that US military activities can serve as ""simulated enemies"" of the PLA, which can help the PLA prepare for actual combat.Troops of the Eastern Theater Command will always be on high alert in defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and safeguarding peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, the spokesperson said.This is the second time the Eastern Theater Command has announced PLA operations in the Taiwan Straits in the past two weeks.On August 13, Zhang said the command sent troops from multiple military branches to several locations, and organized consecutive, realistic drills in the Taiwan Straits and its northern and southern ends. On February 9 and 10, the Eastern Theater Command also announced a combat readiness patrol and joint drills aimed at Taiwan secessionists. "	8/19/20	0	0	-0.9963	-1
"Taiwan's OTT-TV ban politicizes cultural interactions with the mainland: expertniQIYI Photo: cnsphoto The economic affairs authority of Taiwan launched a new rule targeting technology giants iQIYI and Tencent from carrying out ""illegal operations"" in Taiwan without an official license, which experts said is a move that reflects Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party's desire to follow in the US footsteps and create problems via political manipulation in an attempt to diverge from the mainland.The authority has given OTT-TV 14 days notice, after which the plan will be officially announced on September 3, according to a statement by the Taiwanese economic affairs authorities on Tuesday.An OTT media service is a streaming media service offered directly to viewers via the internet, meaning it bypasses cable, broadcast, and satellite television platforms, and therefore any local controls too.The Chinese streaming platform iQIYI applied in 2016 to invest in the Taiwan region and set up a subsidiary, but its OTT-TV business belongs to a sector closed to mainland individuals and companies for investment. iQIYI's application was therefore not approved.The notice says that it is prohibited for organizations or legal representatives in Taiwan to provide agency, distribution, or engage in any way with OTT-TV and its intermediaries or related commercial services with groups and individuals from the mainland during the notice period of 14 days, which will expire on September 1.""OTT mainly deals in video, private meetings and other businesses, and as the two sides communicate with each other, the demand for such businesses in Taiwan will only increase,"" Xiang Ligang, an industry analyst, told the Global Times.""Taiwan people enjoy mainland video programs, especially TV dramas, but cannot watch them through formal channels - only via OTT-TV,"" adds Xiang, noting that there are many similar Taiwanese businesses, but all of which enter the market through agents.In July this year, the Taiwan communications authorities adopted draft measures on the management of internet audio-visual services to cater to OTT service providers both in and outside the region. Such an approach is considered an attack on OTT practitioners on the mainland, and has also been referred to as ""iQIYI, Tencent terms"" in Taiwan, the Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday.

"Mainland, not US, to decide time of national reunificationnTaiwan Photo: Unsplash The Chinese mainland will not let the US decide when and how to reunify the island of Taiwan, and as the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has an overwhelming advantage in the region, reunifying Taiwan by force is not urgent as long as the separatist authority on the island and Washington do not cross the red line, said mainland experts on Sunday in response to a sensational projection by a US Navy think tank that the mainland could launch an attack on Taiwan in January, 2021.In an essay published by the US Naval Institute (USNI), former Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Michael Morell and retired US Admiral James Winnefeld painted a scenario that the Chinese mainland would reunify Taiwan by force in mid-January 2021. According to the two authors' prediction, Beijing considers that the West at that time would be distracted by the post-election power transition in the US, as well as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, so the mainland would see the timing as a significant chance to realize reunification once and for all.Mainland analysts rejected the projection of Morell and Winnefeld, as the mainland still upholds a desire for peaceful reunification. The priority for China has been and continues to be development and economic recovery in a post-pandemic era. If there is any serious tension or even a military clash in the Taiwan Straits, it could only be triggered by the separatist authority on the island and the US. The mainland will not unilaterally create tensions over the Taiwan question, which would be a distraction from its own development.Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert, told the Global Times on Sunday that arms sales and official exchanges between the US and the separatist authority of the island are making the situation more tense, but as long as the red line set by the Anti-Secession Law is not violated, it is unnecessary for the mainland to react to the prediction made by the US, as China has its own plan and timeline.According to the Anti-Secession Law, in the event that ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist forces should act under any name or by any means to cause the fact of Taiwan's secession from China, or that major incidents entailing Taiwan's secession from China should occur, or that possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted, the state shall employ non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.""As the law states, the bottom line is clear. If those incidents happen, the People's Liberation Army must react immediately, regardless of whether there is a power transition in the US or not. If US provocations don't touch the bottom line, China should and will retain its policy of strategic patience to avoid an escalation of the current tension, especially before January 2021,"" Song said.

Just like the enactment of the national security law for Hong Kong this year, if China is provoked too much, it will take action to respond at an appropriate time with its own plan, and the US will surely feel the pain,"" he noted.

This, experts said, is an obvious response to recent US and Taiwan secessionists’ provocative moves, highlighted by US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar's Taiwan visit.By announcing the F-16 deal has been finalized, the US is attempting to show its tough stance, and the move could be considered as corresponding to the PLA drills, Ni Feng, director of the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Saturday.Under these circumstances, the US move is even more dangerous, as it steps on and even crosses the Chinese mainland’s red line on the Taiwan question, Ni said, noting that the risk of a confrontation continues to rise.Chinese mainland military experts told the Global Times following the announcement of the PLA drills that the PLA has been enhancing and normalizing military drills around the island of Taiwan not only to deter secessionists on the island, but to train the troops and gain the capability of turning the exercises into real military actions if necessary.The PLA will continue to develop advanced weapons and equipment to boost its overall capability and widen its already-huge gap with the military on the island, and future military drills could see warplanes fly through the airspace of the island if necessary, they said.Chinese mainland experts said that while F-16V fighter jets could become threats to the PLA forces, the PLA’s J-10B and J-10C fighter jets can rival them, and they are no match for the heavier J-11, not to mention the much more advanced J-20.If a reunification-by-force operation breaks out, the PLA would destroy Taiwan’s air fields and command centers, giving the F-16Vs no chance to even take flight, and giving those already in the air no place to land, analysts said.

The PLA seldom makes public the aim of its exercises, and by announcing the aim this time being ""a certain major power,"" which almost directly points at the United States and ""Taiwan independence"" forces, it is sending a very clear, direct and strong warning to the US and Taiwan secessionists.According to the spokesperson's statement, the drills covered large areas of the Taiwan Straits, and featured many military branches in a joint operation. This means the drills must be of a large scale and could have involved warplanes, warships, amphibious troops, artillery and missiles, observers noted.A Chinese mainland military expert told the Global Times on Thursday on condition of anonymity that the drills showed the PLA can launch attacks on Taiwan secessionists from any direction of the Taiwan Straits.

It is also the first time that we see in media reports that the drills cover the Taiwan Straits and its northern and southern ends.US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar just wrapped up his Taiwan visit. The new National Defense Authorization Act includes a proposal to invite Taiwan to join the US-led Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercises next week. These constitute a trend, as the US and Taiwan upgrade ties and take even more dangerous steps.This is a salami-slicing tactic that is destroying the status quo in the Taiwan Straits. The Tsai Ing-wen authorities keep coordinating with the US Indo-Pacific Strategy to contain the Chinese mainland.The drills of the PLA Eastern Theater Command send a clear warning to Taiwan and the US, which declare the Chinese mainland's firm will that it will not sit still in the face of US and Taiwan provocation, and erosion of the ""one China"" principle. Taiwan and the US should abandon their illusion that they can smoothly upgrade their official ties, as this process is bound to be accompanied by the risks they could hardly bear.Military actions are the ultimate card the mainland plays to deter ""Taiwan independence"" forces. The Anti-Secession Law has put the Democratic Progressive Party in awe. The recent drills by the Eastern Theater Command sends a clear message that the mainland's military pressure on Taiwan will increase together with the increasing collusion between the US and Taiwan, and that as long as the US and Taiwan can bear the worsening situation in the region, the Chinese mainland fears no ""shake.""The PLA has more options to impose military pressure, including fighter jets flying around the island, passing the ""middle line"" of the Straits and even flying over Taiwan Island, testing ballistic missiles over the Taiwan Island, and carrying out military exercises in the eastern waters of Taiwan, until Taiwan is completely haunted by the thought that a war will break out anytime.The Chinese mainland will not allow Taiwan to increase its bargaining chip to seek ""independence"" by acting as a strategic US pawn. The increasing collusion between Taiwan and the US will only lead to greater risks for the island, including severe turbulence and uncertainties in its economic environment. The comprehensive losses of doing so will far exceed the gains, and Taiwan will likely push itself to the dangerous brink of war.The US must not overestimate the deterrence it could pose by military intervention in the Taiwan Straits. The Chinese people generally no longer believe that US military could dominate the battlefield once a war breaks out there. The Chinese people have enough courage to safeguard their national sovereignty by engaging in the military showdown with the US across the Straits, when all the other options fail. And we are confident we will win. We don't want to go that far, but no country should think about separating Taiwan from China using salami-slicing tactics or intimidating the mainland.Taiwan authorities can choose between a peaceful developing island and a place filled with severe military confrontation, where a hot war could be detonated by a tiny spark. In the past, the PLA's military drills took place in the Taiwan Straits. Currently, they are occurring in the Straits and its northern and southern ends. If Taiwan authorities go further in the future, the PLA's military exercise will emerge in the Straits, in its northern and southern ends and in eastern water of Taiwan, as part of around-the-island drills. Then, PLA fighter jets will carry out exercises above Taiwan.The drills of the Eastern Theater Command show that the PLA is capable of launching a general offensive from all directions in the Taiwan Straits, and seize the island in hours. DPP authorities should use their final rationality. They should know that being a piece in the US chessboard could lead to checkmate. The day may come suddenly when they get swellheaded.

"Taiwan’s potential deployment of US-made missiles, mines easy to counter: expertsnA Z-9 attack helicopter and a WZ-10 attack helicopter assigned to an army aviation brigade under the PLA 73rd Group Army lift off from the flight deck of the dock landing ship Yimengshan (Hull 988) successively during an inter-Services maritime coordinated training exercise with the PLA Navy at an undisclosed sea area on August 3, 2020. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Li Shilong) The island of Taiwan is reportedly in discussions with the US over the purchase of cruise missiles and sea mines, and claimed they will potentially be deployed as coastal defense and amphibious landing deterrence. The intention to purchase these weapons only emphasized Taiwan's outdated war concepts and military technologies, and their potential deployment can be easily countered by the People's Liberation Army (PLA), Chinese mainland experts said on Thursday.Taiwan is working with the US on acquiring a number of hardware capabilities, including cruise missiles that would work in conjunction with the island's indigenous Hsiung Feng missile system to provide better coastal defense, and underwater sea mines and other capabilities to deter amphibious landing, or immediate attack, said Hsiao Bi-khim, the island's representative to the US, at Washington's Hudson Institute think tank on Wednesday, Reuters reported on Thursday.Hsiao claimed that the island of Taiwan needs to expand its asymmetric capabilities to bring about deterrence against the Chinese mainland.However, mainland military experts said the weapons pose no threat to the PLA, as they can be easily countered.Lockdown via sea mines is an outdated tactic from World War II, and the PLA has long gained the capability to sweep sea mines and open green passages, Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Thursday.The PLA troops can also carry out aircraft vertical landing, which will allow them to avoid the sea mines, Song said, noting that the deployment of sea mines will only isolate the island from the rest of the world but will not be able to stop a potential amphibious landing by the PLA.Taiwan has its own indigenous cruise missile, but the intention to purchase US ones showed the island is still fully reliant on the US for advanced technologies, Song said.These types of cruise missiles are only of high subsonic speed, and follow a relatively fixed flight trajectory, Song said, noting that the PLA has a wide selection of tools it can use to intercept them.In May, media reports said the island also wants to buy Harpoon anti-ship missiles from the US, and US-made SeaGuardian surveillance drones are also on the wish list, media revealed earlier this month. In May, the US confirmed it had approved the sales of 18 heavyweight torpedoes to Taiwan.In response to the reported drone deal, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a routine press conference on August 7 that US arms sales to Taiwan island severely undermine China's sovereignty and security interests, and gravely violate basic norms of international relations.

"PLA holds consecutive, realistic drills in Taiwan Straits in response to secessionist movesnTwo fighter jets attached to a naval aviation brigade under the PLA Eastern Theater Command take off simultaneously from a military airfield in East China's Zhejiang Province for a recent flight training exercise. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Liu Yaxun) The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command recently systematically sent troops from multiple military branches into multiple directions and organized consecutive, realistic drills in the Taiwan Straits and its northern and southern ends, the command announced on Thursday.The drills further tested and improved the troops' joint combat capability, said Senior Colonel Zhang Chunhui, the spokesperson of the PLA Eastern Theater Command.Recently, ""a certain major country"" has been continuously making negative moves on the Taiwan question, which has sent seriously wrong signals to ""Taiwan independence"" forces and severely threatened peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, Zhang said.Taiwan is a sacred and inalienable part of Chinese territory, and the patrol and exercise activities by the PLA are necessary operations aimed at the current security situation in the region and safeguarding national sovereignty, the spokesperson stressed.The troops will always be on high alert, take any necessary measures, resolutely counter any provocative actions that could result in ""Taiwan independence"" and separate the country, and resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Zhang said.Global Times "	8/13/20	0	0	0.5106	1
"Next Digital plunges over 40%; SFC urges cautionnA view of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's building in February Photo: VCG RELATED ARTICLES: HK resident seeks Next Digital trading suspension Shares in Jimmy Lai Chee-ying's media firm Next Digital plunged 40.91 percent Wednesday to close at HK$0.65 ($0.084) after two days of large gains. The local capital market regulator Tuesday advised investors to exercise ""extreme caution.""The shares surged 331.37 percent to close at HK$1.10 Tuesday, a rise of about 1,100 percent from Friday.A Hong Kong-based finance observer, who preferred to be anonymous, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the unusual surge in the share price might be because secessionists in Hong Kong such as Joshua Wong Chi-fung called for support for Next Digital.""Given that the previous average daily transaction volume for this stock was less than several million, the price will naturally surge if hundreds of thousands of pro-secession Hong Kong rioters rush to buy the stock,"" the observer said.He said that Next Digital's share price will eventually return to a very low level as the company reports losses of hundreds of millions of Hong Kong dollars annually.The observer stressed that much capital had come from securities firms from the island of Taiwan, saying that money had possibly been transferred from the island to inject into Next Digital shares.Francis T. Lui, professor emeritus of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times that the company doesn't offer much value as an investment, and those who keep holding the shares at a relatively high price are probably the sources of funding.PolitiHK Social Strategic Chairman Innes Tang filed a complaint with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) Tuesday to urge the immediate suspension of Next Digital trading, saying that the unusual movements in its share price would eventually harm investors' interests and the stock exchange's reputation.After receiving a large volume of enquiries, the SFC made a statement on Tuesday night saying it strongly advised investors to exercise extreme caution regarding Next Digital shares. It also urged the company to disclose relevant information.While individual investors who were hoodwinked into buying the stock may face heavy losses, Sing Tao Daily reported Wednesday that Lai is in a rush to dispose of his Hong Kong properties.Lai recently contracted agencies to sell a whole floor of the Tai Ping Industrial Centre in Hong Kong, lowering the price from HK$166 million to HK$133 million, about 5 percent below the market price, the report said. Lai was released on bail on Wednesday morning.""Lai and his Next Digital acted as the commander in chief of anti-China moves for years and therefore there must be a large volume of foreign funding, technologies and propaganda materials to prompt Hong Kong people to promote secessionist activity,"" the observer said, noting that Lai is a malignant tumor for Hong Kong.

"US Embassy's logo change sparks online speculation of playing Taiwan cardnThe US Embassy to China removes the word ""China"" from ""Beijing, China"" in its logo. The social media accounts of the US Embassy to China have dropped the word ""China"" from ""Beijing, China"" in its logo, sparking wide speculation among the Chinese public that the move aims to ""tarnish the one-China principle"" and attempts to play the Taiwan card to further provoke China.Although the embassy on Wednesday explained that the change was part of a normal branding campaign and similar changes will be made to the logos of embassies in other countries, analysts said that Chinese netizens' interpretation of American hostility is reasonable, given the country's latest moves related to the island of Taiwan.Chinese netizens suspected the change was meant to pave the way to the opening of a consulate in the island of Taiwan without mentioning China. ""Such an implicit change is not a blatant violation of the one-China principle, but a subtle betrayal, so it is pretty annoying,"" a Sina Weibo user posted.""Are you implying that the embassy is only for the Chinese mainland?"" said another.The logo of the US embassy on its Sina Weibo and Twitter accounts is based on the seal of the US, a bald eagle holding an olive branch in one claw and arrows in another, which remain the same in the new picture. A netizen commented, ""The major message was preserved: the US, a greedy predator, is using an olive branch to cheat its allies and arrows to hunt for its own benefit.""The change in the logo was made shortly after US Health Secretary Alex Azar's three-day visit to the island of Taiwan, with China-US relations deemed by many Western media outlets as being at a historic low since 1979.Analysts noted it is reasonable that Chinese netizens interpreted it as a provocation amid the US' latest adverse moves, including a senior official's visit to the island of Taiwan and closure of the Chinese Consulate in Houston.Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Wednesday that Chinese netizens are sharp, and they have well recognized American hostility.""The US has been playing petty tricks to provoke China, and the logo change may be one of them,"" he said.The US is unlikely to push bilateral relations to a complete collapse but it is more than willing to use such tricks to annoy China, Lü said.Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, said that such a change, no matter what was the true intention behind it, was bad timing when bilateral relations were already near to derailment.Netizens well understood American animosity, and the strained bilateral relations convinced them to interpret the logo change as another provocation. But at the official level, China will make a cool-headed and sensible response to the impulsive moves made by the US, rather than dance to its tune, analysts said. "	8/12/20	0	0	-0.9889	-1
"US gives no real commitment to Taiwan over vaccinenTaiwan Photo: Unsplash By giving no commitment to a preferential offering for the island of Taiwan on any future coronavirus vaccine, US Health Secretary Alex Azar's visit to the island has been ridiculed as ""a trip of lip service"" that fully exposed the US practice of using Taiwan as a pawn to contain China at no cost. However, the Taiwan authority still refuses to admit it, experts and netizens said.Speaking to reporters on Monday, Azar made it clear that ""our first priority of course is to develop and produce enough quantity of safe and effective FDA-approved vaccines and therapeutics for use in the United States,"" the UK-based Independentreported.Azar also said that the US-developed vaccines would be available in the world community once the needs in the US are met.The remarks were made after the US and the island of Taiwan signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on health cooperation. During a meeting before the signing, Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen expressed expectations that the two sides would make progress in combating the coronavirus, including on vaccine and drug research and production.While the Democratic Progressive Party in the island hailed Azar's visit and the signing of the MOU as major political progresses, Azar's remarks, in which he did not even mention Taiwan by name, frustrated many people in Taiwan with some criticizing Tsai and her DPP for doing its utmost to cooperate with the US in a political drama but getting nothing good for the island of Taiwan.As for the MOU, it was deemed as empty, without mentioning a coronavirus vaccine or drugs. ""Taiwan-US joint epidemic prevention"" is nothing more than the emperor's new clothes, Taiwan local media outlet chinanews.com reported on Tuesday.Azar's ""America First"" remarks also further frustrated many in the island, including Su Ih-Jen, a scientist on infectious diseases and former director of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. A vaccine is what Taiwan needs most in terms of American assistance. Azar's visit was meaningless if the vaccine issue was not addressed, Taiwan news outlet udn.com quoted Su as saying.Chen I-hsin, honorary professor at Taiwan's Tamkang University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the Taiwan authority is doing its utmost to cooperate with the US in this political performance, which has turned out to be a total farce.Which position will Taiwan be in, when the US' domestic needs are met? Chen said that may be after its Five Eyes allies, as well as Japan and South Korea - or even after that.But the domestic need may also make this queue longer considering the severe epidemic in the US. According to data from the Johns Hopkins University, the US had 5,095,163 infections as of press time on Tuesday, topping the global confirmed list.The US in early July announced it was buying nearly all of the next three months' projected production of COVID-19 treatment remdesivir from drug manufacturer Gilead, which was widely criticized as an action ignoring the common good and undermining international cooperation in fighting the coronavirus.One Taiwan netizen commented, ""It is just a political show. The US itself is in the abyss of an epidemic, why still dream of their help?""Observers said that the deeds and remarks of Azar during the visit showed once again that the US is only using the island of Taiwan to provoke China as well as helping US President Donald Trump's reelection. It has no intention to help the island of Taiwan to solve any problems, while Tsai and other separatists refuse to admit the fact. "	8/11/20	0	0	-0.9518	-1

(eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Wei Jinxin) Fighter jets from Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force reportedly crossed the ""middle line"" of the Taiwan Straits at around 9 am Monday morning, an hour before top US health official met with Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen.The PLA operation is considered a strong response to the US move, which broke a diplomatic bottom line of China-US relations. Military operations of even larger scale, like live-fire missile drills east of Taiwan island and near Guam, should not be ruled out if the US provokes further, mainland military experts said on Monday.For the first time, Taiwan announced the deployment of ground-based air defense missiles to monitor the PLA aircraft, Taiwan media reported. Mainland experts said the deployment was provocative in nature but poses little actual threat.J-11 and J-10 fighter jets attached to the PLA Air Force briefly crossed the ""middle line"" of the Taiwan Straits on Monday morning, Taiwan media reported, citing the island's air force headquarters.The reported PLA operation came on the day as Alex Azar, the US Health and Human Services Secretary, met with Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen, which is the highest-level meeting between the US and the island in decades, CNN reported.Xu Guangyu, a senior adviser to the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told the Global Times on Monday that Azar's Taiwan visit broke the bottom line and should be considered a serious provocation, and the US is attempting to sound out the mainland's reaction. If the mainland's reponse is weak, it will continue to provoke even further.The PLA warplanes' operation can give the US and Taiwan secessionists a warning, which showed that the Chinese mainland will not swallow such insults and let them do whatever they want, Xu said.Xu noted that the PLA operation is a very rational one, and more responses in other fields like diplomacy should follow. If the US goes further, the PLA could take more countermeasures, including live-fire missile drills east of Taiwan island and near Guam.The mainland is putting efforts to realize a peaceful reunification on the Taiwan question, but it has never ruled out the possibility of reunifying the island by force, and defending against any possible foreign intervention, analysts said.The military on the island of Taiwan also claimed it used a ground-based air defense missile system to monitor the PLA warplanes' movement. Taiwan media said this is the first time the Taiwan military has announced this kind of deployment.Beijing-based air defense expert Fu Qianshao told the Global Times on Monday that a ground-based air defense missile system also uses multiple radars, including search, track and fire control radars to detect targets. Previously, Taiwan likely used normal radars for detection, but this time it used a missile system, which is a confrontational escalation and a provocation.Using stand-alone radar to monitor aircraft is like using binoculars, but using an air defense missile system to monitor aircraft is like pointing a sniper rifle that can fire at any time, observers said.However, this threatening move is of little practical use against the PLA. When exposed to fire control radars, PLA aircraft can commence jamming, evasive maneuvers, anti-radiation strikes and electronic suppression, Fu said, noting that should there be actual war in the region, most Taiwan anti-aircraft installations will be destroyed in the first place.

"PLA forces hold landing drills amid US military provocationsnA H-6 strategic bomber attached to a bomber regiment of the naval aviation under the PLA Southern Theater Command takes off for a recent realistic flight training exercise. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Gao Hongwei) Ground and naval forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) have been on concentrated schedules in amphibious landing and maritime exercises in the past weeks and will continue to do so in the weeks to come, at a time when the US has been frequently conducting provocative military activities near the island of Taiwan and in the South China Sea.The PLA drills are a show of capability and determination, and the US should be warned and should not make dangerous moves to avoid misjudgments that neither side would like to see, analysts said on Sunday.Ground troops attached to the PLA 74th Group Army, which is based in South China's Guangdong Province, recently conducted a beach assault in a mock confrontation between offensive and defensive camps in South China's Hainan Province, China Central Television (CCTV) reported Saturday.A brigade boarded landing ships at dusk, started sailing at night and arrived at the frontline in the early morning of the next day. With the help of saturated artillery fire from multiple rocket launcher systems, the landing troops successfully seized the beach, CCTV reported.The drills showed that ""the PLA has confidence and determination to safeguard national sovereignty and security interests,"" the report said.The Marine Corps under the PLA Navy recently also held a sea-crossing landing exercise in Guangdong, which featured amphibious assault vehicles and assault boats, CCTV said in a separate report last week.From Tuesday to Thursday and from August 16 to 17, two maritime live-fire drills will be held in waters off Zhoushan, East China's Zhejiang Province, according to two navigation restriction notices released by China's Maritime Safety Administration on Thursday.China's first Type 075 amphibious assault ship reportedly embarked on its maiden voyage from Shanghai on Wednesday, and attack helicopters of the PLA Army also recently conducted a series of sea-crossing assault drills on a Navy warship in waters off East China's Fujian Province.The PLA drills come amid the increasingly frequent provocative military activities made by the US near the island of Taiwan and in waters in the South China Sea.The USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier was spotted in the East China Sea by commercial satellite on Saturday, and a US P-8A anti-submarine patrol aircraft was also found conducting reconnaissance in the southern part of the Taiwan Straits, according to a Weibo post by Beijing-based think tank the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI) on Sunday.In the first half of this year alone, the US sent military aircraft to the South China Sea more than 2,000 times, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi revealed during his interview with the Xinhua News Agency on Wednesday.SCSPI director Hu Bo told the Global Times in a recent interview that ""given the current overall relations between China and the US, if any maritime or aerial accident takes place, the friction could not likely be effectively managed and could result in an escalation. Therefore, the uncertain factors over the Chinese and US militaries' interactions in the South China Sea are large, and the risks are becoming higher.""With the military exercises, China is demonstrating its determination and capability in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and they can also serve as a strong response and deterrence to US military provocations, a military expert who asked not to be identified told the Global Times on Sunday.In a Thursday phone talk between Chinese State Councilor and Minister of National Defense Wei Fenghe and US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, Wei urged the US to improve the management and control of maritime risks and avoid taking dangerous moves that may escalate the situation. Esper said the two militaries should maintain dialogue and consultation to manage crises, avoid misjudgments and reduce risks, Xinhua reported. "	8/9/20	0	0	-0.9433	-1
"Reported US drone sale to Taiwan a political stunt: expertsnA Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) air force formation conducts island patrols during training on April 26, 2018. The formation was made up of fighters, early warning and surveillance aircraft, and H-6K bombers, which took off from various military airfields. The formation flew over the Miyako Strait and Bashi Channel, completing an island patrol, the subject of the training. (Xinhua/Yuan Jun) RELATED ARTICLES: China urges US to halt official contact with Taiwan island China on Friday sharply criticized a reported plan by the US to sell military drones to the island of Taiwan, saying that the move seriously undermines China's sovereignty and security interests. Mainland experts noted that the potential sale is more of a political stun that has little military value.The US was considering selling the island at least four SeaGuardian surveillance drones, which have a range of 6,000 nautical miles (11,100 kilometers), much higher than the 160-mile range of the island's current fleet of drones, Reuters reported on Thursday.The approximately $600 million deal still requires approval from US Congress, but the US Department of State has ""tacitly authorized the sale of the unmanned aerial vehicles,"" according to Reuters. If completed, the deal would be the US' first sale of ""sophisticated"" drones to Taiwan, the report noted.In Beijing, the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Friday harshly criticized the plan, calling the move a serious violation of the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques, particularly the China-US Joint Communique on arms sales to Taiwan signed on August 17, 1982, stipulating that Washington must gradually reduce its arms sales to the island.""This move has severely undermined China's sovereignty and security interests, and has seriously violated the basic norms of international relations,"" Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the ministry, told a routine news briefing.Wang added that ""the Taiwan question bears on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity"" and urged the US to ""stop arms sales to and military ties with Taiwan, so as to avoid causing serious damage to China-US relations and stability across the Taiwan Straits.""Despite the political seriousness of the potential sale, the MQ-9B SeaGuardian surveillance drone would play a very limited role for the Taiwan separatist authority as it wouldn't match the island's geographical position, said Beijing-based naval expert Li Jie.The wide range of the drone originally designed for the US military may not work well in the Taiwan Straits, where the Chinese mainland's People's Liberation Army (PLA) holds air superiority, Li told the Global Times on Friday. ""The PLA can defend [against any action] with its advanced drone technologies, many of which have surpassed those of the US,"" he said.The deal has caused uproar among netizens on the island, with some Facebook users referring to the Tsai Ing-wen authority as an ATM machine that continuously hands out money to the US.US Congress will likely approve the deal, which allows the Trump administration to play its ""Taiwan card"" to provoke the mainland, Li predicted. ""Trump's failures in fighting COVID-19 and saving the US economy have forced him to take a tougher attitude toward the Chinese mainland for re-election votes,"" he noted.It is not yet known whether the US intends to sell unarmed SeaGuardian drones to Taiwan as surveillance aircraft or if a sale would involve weapon-equipped drones, said Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the PLA Naval Military Studies Research Institute.""In any case, it is laughably presumptuous that the separatist Taiwan authority intends to battle against the mainland by buying a few weapons,"" Zhang told the Global Times, saying US weapon sales could intoxicate the island's separatists but would have little actual military effect.The Trump administration last month loosened restrictions on exports of military-grade aerial drones that fly at a speed below 800 kilometers per hour, once categorized as lethal ""category-1"" weapons alongside smaller cruise missiles. The administration announced in May that it would sell 18 heavyweight torpedoes to Taiwan.Chinese State Councilor and Minister of National Defense Wei Fenghe on Thursday stated China's principled position on the Taiwan question in a phone call with US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.In the rare phone conversation, Wei urged the US to improve the management and control of maritime risks and avoid taking dangerous moves that may escalate the situation.Still, the phone call between the top defense officials itself sent a positive signal that shows their willingness to communicate and that neither side would like to see military conflicts or armed confrontations, an anonymous military expert told the Global Times on Friday.The US' plan to sell drones to the Taiwan region, however, has deviated from the effort to maintain communication, and could strain relations between the two militaries, observers said.

Photo:China Military People often ask me, if a military clash breaks out between China and the US, which side will be the winner? People often ask me, if a military clash breaks out between China and the US, which side will be the winner? In terms of overall military strength, who is more powerful, China or the US? It must be the US. However, when it comes to China's coastal waters, China's maritime strength plus onshore combat power vs the maritime strength of the US, it is difficult to say which side is more powerful. If you haven't tried it, there will be uncertainty. If it comes to China's core interests, Taiwan, for example, crosses the line under the US encouragement and leads to a military showdown, then at that time there will be a contest of wills as well as a contest of strength. Who's at the upper hand in that situation? It's a combination of military strength plus morality plus the will to fight. Who do you think would be stronger in a war off China's coast? So the US should be reminded to distance itself from China's core interests. Don't play with fire off China's coast, don't really stir up conflict over Taiwan question, and don't overdo it in the South China Sea. If the Trump administration just wants to create China-US tensions to help his re-election campaign, and is not really ready for a military showdown, then be careful for the next few months, and don't go too far. China certainly doesn't want a war. My suggestion is that under no circumstances should the Chinese military fire the first shot. But I am confident that China will be well prepared to fire a second shot as a response to the first shot. On core interests, China will not back off. China's stance is clear to all. The best way is for China and relevant parties to respect each other's core interests. If the core interests of both sides overlap, the dispute should be carefully managed, not allowed to ferment and get out of control. Having experienced several wars and upheavals, I know that peace is really the most precious thing and defending peace is not easy. At a time when relations between China and the US are deteriorating rapidly and some forces are poised to take advantage of changes in the big picture, China's will, wisdom, and ability to master the situation will be tested over time.

"US, Taiwan cannot shake mainland’s bottom line: Global Times editorialnIllustration: Xia Qing/GT US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar will visit the island of Taiwan ""in the coming days."" The last time a US cabinet official visited the island was in 2014, when then Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy paid a visit. As the Health and Human Services Secretary is a cabinet post, Azar's trip to the island will be more provocative.Why did the US exercise restraint in sending officials to Taiwan in the past four decades? Because international rules require it to do so.The US established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China on January 1, 1979 and cut its ties with the island of Taiwan at the same time. It's a manifestation of Washington's compliance with diplomatic norms that no official exchanges between the US and the island of Taiwan should be carried out. The ""embassy"" of the US in Taipei was renamed the American Institute in Taiwan, Taipei Office as a matter of course.The US passed the so-called Taiwan Relations Act in January 1979, which forcibly opened a way for relations between Washington and the island of Taiwan outside the framework of China-US diplomatic relations. As the act seriously contravenes international law, Washington has maintained restraint in using it.The past two years have seen the passage of a series of US bills, such as the so-called Taiwan Travel Act that allows higher-level US officials to visit the island of Taiwan. This has paved the way for new provocations against China. Azar's visit will be the boldest step taken by the US at a sensitive time.If the US and the island of Taiwan have made up their minds to further enhance bilateral ties, they will have many cards to play. Azar's visit is only a sign. The Chinese mainland must be fully prepared for more moves from the US and the island of Taiwan. The Taiwan question is the lever that the US can most conveniently and comfortably use to exert pressure on China. It's the most challenging issue for China in its strategic maneuvering with the US.Washington wants to undermine existing rules between China and the US in handling the Taiwan question. The international community, including Americans, knows that the US is deliberately provoking and pressuring China. As long as China handles it in a proper way, China will have the moral high ground to tackle the Taiwan question.If the cross-Straits situation spirals out of control and leads to a military showdown, the US and the island of Taiwan will be less confident than the Chinese mainland. The mainland's military strength that has grown rapidly has an advantage in the Taiwan Straits. China has the moral high ground, and the Chinese people have the strong will to safeguard national unification.It is anticipated that the US and the island of Taiwan dare not to push the situation in the Taiwan Straits to the extreme. The Trump administration cannot cross the line even if it wants to boost its election chances by heightening China-US tensions. If bilateral relations spiral out of control, it may deal a heavy blow to Trump's reelection. This is the risk Washington must carefully assess.The US sent Azar to Taiwan as Washington needs to morally justify its provocation. As the epidemic situation in the US worsens, Washington uses health exchanges as an excuse. Beijing should expose the immorality of US provocation in the Taiwan Straits, and suppress US ambitions to further step across the line.Even if China and the US have much room for cooperation, the latter is pushing bilateral relations toward a confrontation. Although the US tries to cover up its intentions with ideology, it destroys rules and the basis for communications between major powers, and hurts world peace and stability. China's necessary countermeasures against US provocations will create complexities to the international pattern, but are within the expectations of the international community, and will block the escalating collusion between the US and the island of Taiwan.As China strengthens its morality, every card it plays will have greater deterrence. We should also make Taiwan society realize that indulging the Tsai Ing-wen authorities in upgrading US-Taiwan ties by ""salami tactics"" is a dangerous move, and being a pawn in the US' hard-line strategy toward China will lead the island of Taiwan to unbearable disaster.The mainland has many cards, including the military card. More importantly, it is much more determined to play the cards than Washington. "	8/5/20	0	0	0.9296	1
"PLA Army’s attack helicopters conduct sea-crossing assault drills on Navy warshipnWZ-10 attack helicopters attached to an army aviation brigade under the PLA 80th Group Army prepare to lift off during an actual combat flight training exercise in east China's Shandong Province on June 10, 2020. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Li Qiguang) Z-10 attack helicopters attached to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Army recently conducted a series of sea-crossing assault drills on a Navy warship. The combination of Army helicopters and Navy warships can significantly boost the PLA's amphibious, vertical landing capability and will play a vital role in potential military operations on the island of Taiwan, military analysts said on Wednesday.An aviation brigade under the 73rd Group Army and a Navy vessel squadron recently held an exercise on cross-service integration between helicopters and warships, in which Army helicopters including the Z-10, Z-9 and Mi-171 landed on a Navy warship and conducted coordinated command and sea-crossing assault drills in a southern sea area off East China's Fujian Province, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Tuesday.During the drills, the Army helicopters took off from a land base, approached the sea area where the Navy's Type 071 amphibious landing ship was located, and landed on the flight deck of the warship, the report said.After soldiers boarded the aircraft, transport helicopters took off again and headed toward the mission area at low altitude under the cover of attack helicopters. On arriving at the designated areas, the soldiers aboard the helicopters rappelled down the helicopters and initiated the attack, CCTV reported.At least one Z-10 attack helicopter featured in the drills is the latest, upgraded variant with upward-facing exhaust openings, which are expected to reduce the chopper's infrared signals and make it harder to target, CCTV's military program Weihutang pointed out.This type of exercise is very significant for the PLA's amphibious, vertical landing capability, as the Army Aviation Force can be trained to become capable of integrating with the Navy Aviation Force and Marines in a large-scale landing operation, a military expert who asked not to be named told the Global Times on Wednesday.The Navy Aviation Force does not have attack helicopters like the Z-10, and the strong fire support from this kind of helicopter will be vital in suppressing hostile ground forces, the expert said.China is developing the Type 075 amphibious assault ship, which will be able to host more helicopters than the Type 071 in amphibious assault missions. Two Type 075s have been launched since 2019.Zhang Keqiang, a flight commander of the Army aviation brigade, said on CCTV that the drills accumulated data and experience for future helicopter-warship integrated combat.Amphibious assault and landing ships, as well as the helicopters carried by them, are key instruments in potential military operations on the island of Taiwan, the anonymous expert said.

"PLA 1st amphibious assault ship appears on maiden voyage, photos shownChina held a launch ceremony for its first Type 075 amphibious assault ship in Shanghai on September 25, 2019. Photo: 81.cn China's first Type 075 amphibious assault ship appears to have embarked on its first sea trial on Wednesday, judging from online videos, pictures, and a sea trial notice in relevant waters by the Maritime Safety Administration.The presumed maiden voyage will likely test the amphibious assault ship's main systems, including propulsion, navigation and communication, military experts said.China's first domestically built Type 075 amphibious assault ship was spotted leaving the Hudong Zhonghua Shipyard along the Huangpu river in Shanghai on Wednesday, according to unverified videos and photos posted on Chinese social media on the day.A navigation restriction notice released by the Maritime Safety Administration of China, also heightened assumptions the ship was heading to sea. The notice, published on Tuesday, said a ship would leave the Hudong Zhonghua Shipyard on Wednesday afternoon for a sea trial, and traffic control would be in force in related waters and other ships should pay attention.The navigation restriction notice did not specify which ship was to be involved in the sea trial, but military observers said it was very likely the Type 075, and military enthusiasts claimed that they have seen the Type 075 leaving the shipyard on Wednesday and posted related photos on Chinese social media.Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, told the Global Times that a first sea trial would likely test the Type 075's propulsion system among other major systems including navigation and communication systems.The ship was launched on September 25, 2019 in Shanghai with a grand ceremony, the Xinhua News Agency reported at that time.If the ship is heading to sea, it would be less than a year between its launch and maiden voyage, which could indicate the outfitting work of the first Type 075 has been progressing smoothly, Li said, noting that in the past few months, the ship was likely outfitted with electromechanical devices, power units, communication systems, radars, circuits, and pipes.In early April, the ship reportedly caught on fire, which was quickly extinguished. Sources told the Global Times then that the fire was very minor and would not impact further construction.Li said that a sea trial would show that the fire did not delay the ship's construction.It usually takes a new warship a year or two to formally join military service after its first sea trial, military analysts said. This means the first Type 075 will likely be commissioned into the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy in 2021 or 2022, they said.On April 22, China launched its second Type 075 amphibious assault ship also in Shanghai, a little more than six months after the launch of the first. Experts said that China has mastered mature technologies, prepared related aviation equipment and needs the ships in safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity.The Type 075 is comparable to the US' Wasp-class amphibious assault ship. This type of Chinese warship is widely expected to play a major role around the Taiwan Straits and the South China Sea.The fast progress of the Type 075's construction is also an indication of China's urgent need of this type of ships, observers said.

Photo:Xinhua Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei has reportedly signed a letter of intent for a large chip purchase order with Taiwan's MediaTek, a move showcasing it is adapting a strategy of unifying industry ""competitors"" and diversifying chip supplies amid a countdown to the US' toughened chip ban, said analysts.According to media reports, Huawei has ordered more than 120 million chips from MediaTek. MediaTek said in a response that ""it does not comment on information related to a single customer.""""I would say the report is 90 percent true,"" Ma Jihua, an industry analyst and a close follower of Huawei, told the Global Times Tuesday, noting that buying chips from its former competitor MediaTek is a forced but also a well-planned move to give the company breathing space over the US chip ban.The US government put Huawei on an ""Entity List"" in May 2019 which required US firms to obtain a license to export domestically produced chips and software. On May 15 this year, Washington toughened the rules by requiring licenses for sales to Huawei of semiconductors made abroad with US technology, with a 120-day buffer time.It is a win-win move, as Huawei's chip subsidiary HiSilicon may risk ""finding nowhere to produce high-end chips,"" so the Chinese firm has to diversify its chip supplies. It happens that MediaTek's 5G chips are ""not bad,"" a Huawei follower surnamed Jiang told the Global Times Tuesday.On the other hand, MediaTek will also stand out among competitors with orders from such a big customer as Huawei, Jiang said.If the deal is true and assuming that Huawei could ship about 180 million mobile phones this year, MediaTek's market share is more than two-thirds, far better than its US counterpart Qualcomm, media reports estimated.The move also comes as Huawei has reached a deal with US chip firm Qualcomm to settle a patent dispute last week. Huawei will pay Qualcomm $1.8 billion for back royalties owed for 2019 and for the first six months of this year under the new global patent license agreement. The new deal also includes a cross license granting back rights to certain Huawei patents, covering sales beginning January 1, Qualcomm said.""The series move also signifies Huawei is adapting its strategy amid the US' intensified crackdown, and it's trying to reduce industry opponents while seeking cooperation and deepened ties with more industry players to counter the US ban,"" Ma said.Some industry analysts said the deal with Qualcomm may also pave the way for the US company to supply 5G semiconductors to Huawei in the future.Nevertheless, Ma noted the reconciliation between Qualcomm and Huawei cannot be said to have direct benefits. After all, Huawei's problems are beyond the control of itself and Qualcomm as it is up to the Trump administration, Ma said.""But an intertwined and deepened interest bond with a US firm will no doubt have positive influence on the policy trend,"" Ma said.Industry analyst Jiang noted that this brings ties between the Chinese and US technology industries closer, which may create favorable conditions for higher-level negotiations and make so-called ""decoupling"" more difficult.""Moreover, a development of 5G standards and its related industries also needs cooperation among Qualcomm, MediaTek and Huawei,"" Jiang said.The Chinese firm has been moving against the headwinds over the past months. According to a report from TrendForce sent to the Global Times, Huawei is set to surpass Sweden's Ericsson to become the largest supplier in the mobile base station equipment market this year. Huawei is expected to occupy a global share of 28.5 percent, beating Ericsson by 2 percentage points.For the first time ever, Huawei in the second quarter unseated Samsung to become the top smartphone vendor globally. According to Canalys, a technology research firm, Huawei took 19 percent of the global market share by shipping 55.8 million devices in the second quarter of 2020.This came after Google cut its support for Huawei under the US rule, which was aimed at denting Huawei's overseas phone sales.

"DPP ‘will capitalize’ on Lee Teng-hui’s deathnFormer Taiwan regional leader Lee Teng-hui File photo: VCG After the death of the ""godfather of Taiwan secessionism,"" Lee Teng-hui , was announced on Thursday, several politicians tried to capitalize on the former Taiwan leader's death, including US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the current leader of the island, Tsai Ing-wen, with experts saying they continue to push for separatism and spread an anti-China sentiment.Tsai, who is also the chairman of the separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said on social media Thursday that she ordered the authorities on the island to provide the ""highest-standard assistance"" to issues related to Lee's death.Pompeo also said in a statement on the US State Department's website on Thursday that ""On behalf of the American people, I would like to offer my sincere condolences on the passing of former Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui .""Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a routine press conference on Friday that ""we have taken note of the statement. Taiwan secessionism is a dead end, and the reunification and national rejuvenation of China is the trend of history, which is unstoppable to any individual or force. We urge the relevant countries to uphold the one-China principle, to cautiously handle the matters about Taiwan, and not to send wrong information to Taiwan separatist forces.""Chang Ya-chung, a professor at the National Taiwan University and a member of the pro-reunification Kuomintang (KMT), told the Global Times that although Lee was the chairman of the KMT, the DPP's major rival in Taiwan, Lee is more like a leader of the separatist DPP. ""Without Lee's support, the separatist sentiment of Taiwan and the DPP would not have become as powerful as it is today.""Lee, who took office in 1988 and retired in 2000, has long been decried as the ""godfather of Taiwan secessionism"" by people from the mainland and Taiwan, and because of his flattering attitude toward Japan. Denying his Chinese identity was heavily criticized by Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Straits.Lee's separatist tendencies in the 1990s almost caused a military conflict between the mainland and the island, after he broke with the 1992 Consensus and the one-China principle to promote separatism for the island.He also provided significant support to separatism's growth in the island, and offered valuable assistance to the DPP to turn it into the KMT's main rival, and challenge Chinese culture and identity in the island.After he left office, Lee continued to push for secession. Lee and other extreme separatists of the island established a political group called the ""Formosa Alliance"" in 2018 to push for an ""independence referendum"" in Taiwan to continuously threaten the peace and stability of the Taiwan Straits.Chang said, ""For Tsai and her DPP, praising Lee is praising their own political ideas, and Tsai also wants to capitalize on Lee's death to invite figures from Japan and the US to increase Taiwan's visibility in the international arena for their separatist purpose. Pompeo just wants to make the Chinese mainland uncomfortable, since praising Lee costs him nothing to offend China.""Pompeo said that ""During his 12-year tenure, Lee's bold reforms played a crucial role in transforming Taiwan into the beacon of democracy we see today. He cemented the deep friendship between the United States and Taiwan.""Chang said the West praised Lee for transforming the island into a democracy, but don't know that the democracy built by Lee is based on dividing the local people in Taiwan and people from the mainland who have been living on the island since 1949, when the KMT authority was defeated by the Communist Party of China, and retreated to Taiwan.Another cost of Lee's ""democracy"" in Taiwan is corruption, as Lee started to engage with the local forces in power-for-money deals to increase localism and separatism, said Chang, adding that ""these are the evil facts hidden behind the 'democracy' Lee established on the island.""After Lee's death, people in Taiwan were divided, why some are celebrating and some others praising him, which is a proof of the dividing society that he created, Chang noted.The KMT also released a statement on Lee's death, saying Lee used to be the chairman of the KMT but made the KMT walk a totally different path, and ""he will be judged by future generations."" The former leaders of the KMT also expressed the same attitude as they refused to directly criticize the damage that Lee had brought to the KMT and cross-Straits relations.The KMT has lost its spirit and the reason why many former leaders of the party refused to criticize Lee is that they were all get promoted by Lee, so due to the restriction of Chinese traditional culture or opportunistic reason for politics, they refused to directly criticize Lee as most of them have received kindness from him.The sentence ""he will be judged by future generations"" in the KMT statement means the KMT and former party leaders refuse to praise him and disagree with his idea and policies, Chang added.

"Cross-Taiwan Straits couples condemn DPP over entry ban on childrennMainland-Taiwan parents kneel and call for cancellation of the entry ban (photo: Courtesy of mainland-Taiwan parents self-help organization) The Taiwan regional authority's move to bar entry for children of cross-Taiwan Straits couples amid the COVID-19 pandemic is causing anger among the public due to its obvious politicization of the virus and discrimination against mainland residents.Many mainland-Taiwan families who have been separated from their loved ones across the Straits have condemned the separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority for utilizing these children as a tool for political purposes, urging it to let them return to the island and reunite with their parents soon.Ye, a mother who has been separated from her son since the virus outbreak, has made lots of petitions to Taiwan authorities in these months. She and some other parents even knelt at the gate of the local health department in Taiwan and called for cancellation of the entry ban, only to get no response.""I never thought there would be a day I would kneel down to others only for family reunion,"" Ye told the Global Times. Months of separation have made this brokenhearted mother extremely worried and sleepless, having to take drugs for treating anxiety disorders. ""Being ripped apart from my child is a big pain to me,"" she said.Taiwan has opened its door to resident-certificate holders from many countries and regions - including the US - yet it still rejects the children of Taiwan residents and their mainland spouses, although these children also have Taiwan resident certificates and have been living on the island for a long time.Taiwan's entry ban came out in late January before the Ye family was about to head back for Taiwan after spending the Chinese New Year (CNY) vacation in Ye's hometown Fujian Province in the mainland. Ye and her husband had to go back to the island for work, leaving their son alone in Fujian with no friends and few relatives.Ye criticized the ban as inhumane and merciless. ""Doesn't the DPP have family or kids?"" she asked. ""It has no sympathy.""Including Ye's son, there are more than 400 children of mainland-Taiwan couples left in the mainland because of the unfair entry ban, according to the Taiwan New Inhabitants Development Association.The excuse of ""epidemic control"" that the DPP authority uses to bar these kids is totally untenable, said Xu Chunying, the association's director.""It's quite unfair that the DPP allows people from areas severely affected by the virus to come, while it locks out children returning from the mainland where the epidemic situation has largely contained,"" Xu told the Global Times.The DPP is utilizing the pandemic to serve its ""independence"" agenda, said mainland observers. By stigmatizing COVID-19 as a ""Wuhan virus"" and preventing children of mainland-Taiwan couples from entering, it attempts to decouple and escalate ""confrontation"" with the mainland, said Ni Yongjie, deputy director of the Shanghai Institute of Taiwan Studies.""Meanwhile, it shamelessly tries every possible way to please some foreign forces, easing entry restrictions even on those from high-risk areas,"" Ni told the Global Times.Since March, Xu's association and some other nongovernment groups have been helping these families reach local officials and express their appeals. To their disappointment, the Taiwan authority has seldom responded to their requests but kept talking about the mainland's so-called ""lack of transparency"" in the fight against COVID-19, which is no more than a groundless smear, said some of the families reached by the Global Times.Taiwan native Liu, who had been in Shanghai with his wife and 3-year-old child before coming back to the island alone in early July, has repeatedly sent petitions to various departments of the local government. ""But they just pass the buck and have never replied,"" he said.Contrary to the Taiwan authority's smear, Liu said he felt the mainland has done a good job in controlling the epidemic. ""During my stay in Shanghai, I personally experienced the efforts that the local government made in fighting the virus,"" he told the Global Times.The DPP, by blaming the mainland for the pandemic and slandering the 400 kids as virus spreaders, is attempting to stir up ""anti-mainland sentiment"" among local residents, Liu said. If it is really for the sake of epidemic control, it can at least ask the 400 children in the mainland to take a test and have a 14-day quarantine when entering the island - just as people coming from other places do - rather than simply shutting them out, he added.There had been nearly 400,000 mainland-Taiwan couples in total by 2019, estimated a Taiwan-based cross-Straits marriage coordination and promotion association.After the travel ban caused rage across the island, the Taiwan authorities started allowing children of mainland-Taiwan couples aged under 2 to enter from July 16, Taiwan-based media reported.But this ""concession"" is perfunctory and insincere, Xu said, adding that there may be only 10 or fewer children of that age among the over 400. ""What's more, children aged above 2 also need parents' care, and their rights should be guaranteed as well,"" she told the Global Times.It is ironic that the DPP, which keeps boasting about their ""humanity"" and ""care"" amid the pandemic, cold-bloodedly turned a blind eye to the pain of family separation and disregarded the basic human rights of the involved children, such as their right to education, Xu said.An'an (pseudonym), the child of a mainland-Taiwan couple and freshman of a Taiwan-based university, has missed a whole semester's offline courses because of the entry ban. Staying in Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, he has to take temporary online courses with no textbooks and is unable to interact with his teachers.""He can't learn well in that way,"" said An'an's father surnamed Chang, who has had to quit his job in Taiwan to stay with An'an in Heilongjiang amid the pandemic, with his wife going back to the island alone.Feeling antipathy against the pitiless Taiwan authority, An'an is now unwilling to go back to the island, Chang told the Global Times. He recalled something that An'an wrote in his recent homework, saying that it doesn't matter to him whether or not he can go back to Taiwan as it is a place full of lies. "	7/28/20	0	1	-0.9974	-1

Experts said whether or not the two major powers can avoid military conflict in the next three months depends on the White House, and China needs to make its deterrence ""more visible"" to warn the US about how dangerous a war could be.Jin Canrong, associate dean of Renmin University of China's School of International Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday that apart from the upcoming presidential election and failed handling of the domestic epidemic situation, ""the collective hostility against China among US elites and policymakers, which we didn't expect, will also make the US more aggressive.""Hostile remarks on China made recently by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien do not just represent the Trump administration, but also meet the demand of the ""deep state"" in the US, and China must be aware of these dangerous signs, Jin noted.""Direct China-US military conflicts, or even the severance of diplomatic ties, which used to be unimaginable, are being discussed more frequently by the mainstream media outlets and scholars, so the danger of military conflicts exists and is growing,"" he said.Ezra Vogel, Professor Emeritus at Harvard University and a leading US scholar on East Asian affairs, expressed the same concern in an exclusive interview with the Global Times.""Unfortunately, there is [possibility of an armed confrontation]. Nobody wants it, and everybody would lose if a war erupts. But if you look at what happened in World War I, for example, it was started by a little event, and then the larger countries quickly became involved even though they had not planned to,"" he said.Vogel further said, ""If there is a little scuffle in the South China Sea, it could soon escalate. And if the countries fail to control it, it could be devastating and everybody would lose. It is very scary."" The guided-missile frigate Hengyang (Hull 568) attached to a destroyer flotilla with the navy under the PLA Southern Theater Command fires its close-in weapons system at a mock sea target during a maritime live-fire training exercise in waters of the South China Sea on June 18, 2020.File photo:China Military The rising tensions between the two countries and increased military activities from both sides even raised speculations that the US could attack China's islands in the South China Sea, since US military presence in the region has increased. But Chinese military experts said the US has no advantage in the South China Sea.An E-8C battlefield command and surveillance aircraft of the US Air Force again approached South China's coastal province Guangdong on Tuesday morning in the sixth such operation in the past two weeks, according to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI), a Beijing-based think tank.Citing SCSPI, media in the island of Taiwan said that US military aircraft have been frequently appearing in the Bashi Channel south of the island, and conducting reconnaissance operations on the Chinese mainland.As of Tuesday, the US has conducted more than 60 close-in reconnaissance operations with large aircraft in the South China Sea, according to SCSPI. The US Navy also held dual carrier exercises in the South China Sea twice earlier this month, with B-52 and B-1B bombers also frequently operating in and around the region, media reported.The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) also conducted intense drills in the South China Sea , including one in waters off the Leizhou Peninsula from July 25 till August 2, that the PLA said would feature powerful ammunition; one near the Xisha Islands from July 1 to 5, and many others with bombers, fighter bombers, anti-submarine aircraft, destroyers and frigates, media reported.On potential military conflicts in the region between China and the US, Hu Bo, director of SCSPI, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the chance of a large-scale conflict between China and the US is minimal because both countries are nuclear powers. Even if the US frequently flexes its muscles in the South China Sea, it does not mean it is materially and mentally prepared for a major conflict.Rumors say the US could launch attacks on Chinese islands and reefs in the South China Sea, but ""this is basically impossible, as the US knows this will lead to an all-out war,"" Hu said.However, the possibility of small and medium-sized clashes, which could involve ship collisions and occasional firing incidents, is rising, Hu said, noting that the uncertainties mainly come from the US, including its upcoming presidential election, influence of domestic hard-liners, and potential escalations of aircraft and vessel encounters in the South China Sea.""Maybe the US could start an armed conflict, but it would be up to more than the US to decide how this conflict would end, as China will and must safeguard its bottom line and dignity no matter how much it wants to maintain China-US relations,"" Hu said.Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, said, ""Although US reconnaissance operations have increased, an incident similar to the one in 2001 would be unlikely as China has more advanced fighter jets and anti-air systems to warn and expel US aircraft.""In 2001, a US intelligence aircraft, which was conducting a reconnaissance mission extremely close to South China's Hainan Province, collided with a PLA fighter jet. The Chinese pilot is still missing.But if US aircraft or ships in the region cross the bottom line of China's security and sovereignty, and also ignore the warning, small-scale ""firing incidents"" could erupt, Song told the Global Times on Tuesday.

(eng.chinnmil.com.cn/Photo by Li Wei) Taiwan more risky Song said the US has no advantage in the South China Sea, and a typical Trump characteristic on military decision-making is that he really doesn't want to get involved in a costly conflict with other countries, even if these countries are much weaker than the US, like Iran and Syria.But US politicians believe that Taiwan is a card that can effectively influence the Chinese mainland, and the US Congress has already authorized the White House to boost military ties with the island. So it is very likely to see Taiwan military forces join drills organized by the US, or US military ships could visit Taiwan ports, Song noted.Jin said patience is needed to handle US provocations on politics, trade and diplomacy, and wait until the next US administration.""But there is no room for Chinese policymakers to compromise on sovereignty and security issues. The US could face a direct military operation from the PLA if it provokes China,"" Jin noted.At this point, deterrence is extremely important, Jin said. ""Some US politicians who support a hawkish approach to China don't even know China is armed with nuclear arsenals. This is truly dangerous, because it means your rivals have no idea about your strength, and then they will make stupid moves. We need to make our deterrence more visible, transparent and direct, to effectively deter any US military provocation.""If the US crosses the red line and activates the Anti-secession Law of China, the PLA will give a stronger response than during the 1995-96 Taiwan Straits crisis, as the PLA is getting much more powerful and modern, analysts said.

Tsai has said she likes watching palace dramas such as Story of Yanxi Palace before going to bed.High-quality film and television works are a good channel for Taiwan residents to understand what is popular in the Chinese mainland while being entertained at the same time.These works act as a bridge for communication between the two places’ residents, but they have been painted with political colors and considered as a kind of political tool by some politicians in Taiwan.Many high-quality TV dramas produced by Taiwan teams have been introduced to the Chinese mainland, which is supported and encouraged to promote cultural communication.In February 2018, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council lifted the restrictions on Taiwan films entering the Chinese mainland and announced there would be no restriction for Taiwan residents who participate in the production of TV shows in the Chinese mainland, according to a report from the Xinhua News Agency.Hit TV series like Someday or One Day and The World Between Us from the island of Taiwan swept social media in the mainland and got rave reviews from audiences and critics.Shi Wenxue, a film critic as well as a teacher at the Beijing Film Academy, praised Someday or One Day for its high quality and told the Global Times that it was a TV work wrapped by love, reasoning and other elements that can really reflect social issues, as is The World Between Us.“I have watched many classic TV dramas produced in Taiwan since childhood and have come to learn about the daily lives of Taiwan residents through these dramas,” a fan of Taiwan TV shows in the mainland surnamed Wan told the Global Times.“I hope Taiwan residents also have chance to know our life.”The popularity of films and TV shows from the Chinese mainland in Taiwan demonstrates that local audiences are interested in related content and are attracted by these entertainment works, which should not been hindered for political purposes or else it will be opposed by the public.Ye Qingyuan, a lawyer from Taiwan, is one such opponent. Ye has criticized the draft ban, saying it is an action that will see no reward. "	7/22/20	0	0	0.9917	1
"Stronger ties with Washington won’t buy time for TaiwannIllustration: Liu Rui/GT Taiwan's 36th annual Han Kuang military exercise, the island's largest military drill, kicked off on July 13 based on the scenario of an ""invasion"" by the mainland military. But what deserves much more attention is the US role behind the island's display of its military power.Under the leadership of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Taiwan's refusal to accept the one-China principle and its rejection of Beijing's reunification efforts have gained growing support from Washington. Since US President Donald Trump took office in 2017, the US has been increasingly improving its political and particularly military relations with the island of Taiwan.The Trump administration just approved its seventh deal of arms sales to Taiwan earlier this month. This makes the Trump administration the most pro-Taiwan US administration since Richard Nixon. The total sum and frequency of military sales to the island of Taiwan have rarely been seen since Washington diplomatically recognized Beijing in 1979. Besides, US warships frequently sail through the Taiwan Straits, aggravating regional tensions and leading to regional instability.In addition, the US Congress has introduced more than 50 Taiwan-related bills and resolutions in the past three and half years. Six have been enacted, including the Taiwan Travel Act, Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018, Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act of 2019, and three National Defense Authorization Acts for fiscal year 2018-2021. All of these laws and bills advocate a stronger and more comprehensive Washington-Taiwan relationship, including the enhancement of the so-called defense relationship.The pro-Taiwan policy that Washington has adopted has resulted in huge influence on the cross-Straits ties.First, it has affected the party politics on the island. US support undoubtedly consolidates Tsai Ing-wen's power and her party's ruling foundation on the one hand, while undermining the mainland-friendly Kuomintang's (KMT) political power base on the other. Tsai could not be successful in her reelection bid in 2020 without the US support. This makes the prospect of a détente between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits more difficult.More importantly, further US intervention in the Taiwan question encourages the Taipei authorities and separatists to take more aggressive actions. These trends have led to the deterioration of political and security situations across the Taiwan Straits. As the latest report by the International Crisis Group reveals, continued US military presence makes the Taiwan Straits one of a few places with a ""deteriorating situation.""The reason for Washington's unprecedented interference in Taiwan is mainly due to the structural changes in the US-China relations. One may have noticed that when bilateral ties developed smoothly in the 1970s and 1980s, Washington remained relatively restrained on the Taiwan question. However, when the US-China ties soured, and especially since China has been treated as a strategic competitor, the US was more likely to step in China's domestic affairs and use Taiwan as a strategic ""card"" to balance against the Chinese mainland - as the George W. Bush administration did well before the 9/11 attacks. In a nutshell, Taiwan is nothing but a card that will be played by the US against the mainland whenever Washington finds it expedient to do so.Deteriorating US-China relations make the Taiwan card relevant again in US' Indo-Pacific Strategy.

"Game’s musical director under fire for publishing HK secessionist slogan in Morse codenPhoto: Rayark Games website A Taiwan game company's musical director has come under fire after netizens discovered he uploaded a piece of music featuring the Hong Kong secessionist slogan in Morse code back in March.Ice, the Hong Kong musical director at Rayark Games' headquarters in Taiwan, uploaded a musical piece titled Telegraph: 1344 7609 2575 to the music sharing platform SoundCloud in March, in which netizens revealed on Saturday that the slogan ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"" was hidden in Morse code, according to media reports. Ice announced his resignation from the company the same day.The musical piece has been removed from the SoundCloud platform as of press time.The Hong Kong Special Administration Region (HKSAR) government explicitly said on July 2 that the slogan ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"" connotes separatism or subversive message and the newly-enacted national security law for Hong Kong prohibits any act that endangers the national security such as attempts to split the country and subvert the state power.Ice claimed in a post on his personal Facebook account on Saturday that the act of uploading the music in March had nothing to do with Rayark Games, but was a purely personal activity. ""I decided to resign and leave the position in Rayark Games de dato,"" he wrote in the post.Rayark Games has yet to respond to Global Times' request for comment over the incident as of press time.Angry mainland gamers have called for the Taiwan company to make a clear stance opposing Hong Kong secessionism on the issue, giving poor ratings for the company's music rhythm game Cytus II, before the game was removed from the mainland's Apple app store.The game's agent company in the mainland, Dragonest Games, has issued a statement saying that ""after investigation, the song in question is a personal creation, is not in the game, and neither Dragonest nor Rayark were informed of the incident, and the song doesn't represent the position of Dragonest and Rayark.""""Rayark received the resignation from the composer of the song after being informed, and accepted it. Further collaboration with the composer will be stopped. We apologize for any impact from the incident, and strongly condemn the action of the composer,"" the mainland agent said.The incident has reflected the high sensitivity of netizens and their increasingly resolute attitude to safeguarding the country's sovereignty, Zhang Yiwu, a cultural studies expert and Chinese literature professor at Peking University, told the Global Times on Sunday.""Ice's unprofessional acts will hurt his career and harm the gaming company for a long time,"" Zhang said, noting that the company's clear attitude against separatist forces will now be essential for it to win back the mainland market.

"Taiwan’s counter-landing drill with PLA in mind a ‘naïve, meaningless show’n A naval formation consisting of aircraft carrier Liaoning has conducted take-off and landing drills in the South China Sea on Jan. 1, 2017. The formation, which is on a ""cross-sea area"" training exercise, involved J-15 fighter jets, as well as several ship-borne helicopters. (Photo source: Navy.81.cn) A counter-landing drill, as part of Taiwan's annual Han Kuang exercises, was held on Thursday. It simulated a joint operation featuring land, naval and air troops against incoming landing forces, which obviously attempted to represent the Chinese mainland's People's Liberation Army (PLA). The drill failed to acknowledge a potential real combat scenario in which PLA would likely launch intensive missile attacks first, and it also assumed the PLA could not seize air superiority and would not attack while landing, said Chinese military analysts, who called the drill a na?ve and meaningless show. The drill took place at Jianan Beach in Taichung, a location the Taiwan military believes to be a potential spot for the PLA's landing, on Thursday morning, with Taiwan's regional leader Tsai Ing-wen in attendance, Taiwan media reported. Designed to simulate PLA tactics, the exercise started with Taiwan military's fighter jets attacking the landing fleet, with a warship as support, after which artillery forces, attack helicopters and tanks fired and eventually ""effectively stopped the hostile forces' landing operation,"" Taiwan media reported. After watching the drill, military observers soon pointed out that its setting is nearly impossible, because it assumed Taiwan would automatically hold air superiority, Taiwan's weapons and equipment would remain intact prior to the counter-landing operation, and its troops would not suffer losses during the battle. According to a computer combat simulation published by the Chinese mainland's Naval and Merchant Ships magazine in May, as well as many other military analysts, a reunification-by-force operation by the PLA will very likely start with intensive waves of missile and rocket attacks that would neutralize most of Taiwan's air defense capabilities, and PLA warplanes would then seize air superiority and sweep enemies, with PLA warships, including two aircraft carriers, also engaging in naval battles. PLA landing operations would take place after this first round of assault, meaning that the scenario Taiwan military simulated on Thursday will not happen, because any weapons and troops they deployed in the drills will be mostly destroyed before their counter-landing operation, observers noted. Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Thursday that the Taiwan military's exercises are a meaningless show, as they were set under ideal conditions. The Tsai Ing-wen authority and Taiwan military know the Taiwan military does not stand a chance against the PLA, but they still wanted to give themselves a false sense of courage, Song said, noting that this mentality is also boosted by the US, which is selling weapons to the island. In the previous days of this year's Han Kuang exercises, Taiwan launched missiles, torpedoes and carried out fighter jet sorties, Taiwan media reported. Another Chinese mainland military expert told the Global Times on condition of anonymity that the exercises remained at a level in which only weapons were test-fired, and were far away from real joint drills. The drills underestimated the PLA's determination and capability to achieve reunification, the expert said. In the afternoon, a military helicopter participating in Taiwan's Han Kuang exercises crashed at an air force base in Hsinchu, Taiwan media reported "	7/16/20	0	0	-0.9147	-1
"Hangzhou plans to train 1,000 Taiwan livestreamers for mainland marketnTaiwan residents learn llivestreaming skills in Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang Province. (photo: courtesy of Shao Qing Technology) RELATED ARTICLES: CEO livestreaming a new trend in China to boost sales As an increasing number of young people in China's Taiwan island have shown their enthusiasm to engage in the mainland's mushrooming e-commerce livestreaming industry, some mainland NGOs and companies are trying to offer them a helping hand. A nonprofit project in Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang Province, where tech giants including Alibaba are located, has been launched to teach Taiwan youngster livestreaming promotion skills.The project aims to cultivate a total of 1,000 Taiwan livestreamers within three years, the Hangzhou Association of Taiwan Compatriots Investment Enterprises (HATCIE), the project's initiator, told the Global Times.It rejects those with a ""pro-independence"" background, said some participants reached by the Global Times. The livestreamers are not supposed to make separatist remarks during the livestreaming, they said.Participants said they are fine with the possible check on their political background by the project. ""That's fair enough,"" a trainee named Yu Chih-pin told the Global Times. ""It would offend the mainland audience if some of us suddenly shouted unfriendly slogans in the livestreaming.""Yu, a Taiwan entrepreneur who built a technology consulting company in Hangzhou, was one of the participants who enrolled in the courses at HATCIE's recommendation.Though lacking livestreaming sales experience himself, Yu said he was very interested in the mainland's fast-growing industry, which can give his business more opportunities. ""Also, the mainland has a good environment for cultivating talent in emerging industries,"" Yu added.Today's Taiwan residents are attracted by the mainland's huge e-commerce market, and many of them would like to start a business or look for a job in this area, said HATCIE Deputy Director Tsung Chia-hung.""Lots of young people from Taiwan in Hangzhou have told us that one of their ideal careers is to do livestreaming sales in the mainland, such as in Hangzhou,"" Tsung told the Global Times.The project, organized by HATCIE and Hangzhou-based company Shao Qing Technology, started recruiting trainees on July 3. The first batch of 100 trainees were fully enrolled within 10 days, containing entrepreneurs, company staffers and university graduates from the island, said the company's CEO Shao Zhengjia.During the five-month online training that will start on August 1, participants are going to learn detailed livestreaming skills for free, including how to select livestreaming equipment and how to interact with audiences, Shao told the Global Times.Trainees will also learn the different usage of some terminology across the Straits, including when it comes to political aspects, Shao said.""Taiwan livestreamers should pay attention to the way they refer to some politicians in the island,"" he said. ""For example, if they had to mention Tsai Ing-wen in the livestreaming, we will suggest they call her 'Ms Tsai' instead of her other titles.""The project's participants agreed. ""What's more, I think there's no need to intentionally talk about politics in the livestreaming sales,"" Yu said. ""Just focus on the promotion.""Compared with their tens of thousands of mainland peers, livestreamers from Taiwan have unique advantages in this highly competitive industry in the mainland, Shao said. ""Taiwan regional accents sound warm and friendly to mainland audiences,"" he said.Nonetheless, the mainland's major livestreaming platforms like Douyin and Kuaishou are not yet completely open to livestreamers from Taiwan, Tsung said. Only those with Chinese mainland ID cards can register as independent livestreamers on these platforms, he explained.""Currently, Taiwan residents can do livestreaming promotions in the mainland under the name of a registered company,"" Tsung added.Taking the situation into account, the project organizers said they are considering working with local human resource authorities and livestreaming platforms to issue a certification to qualified Taiwan livestreamers, which they hope may help this group better engage in this industry.""We are looking forward to a more diverse and colorful e-commerce livestreaming market in the mainland with an increasing number of Taiwan livestreamers joining in,"" Shao said, adding that his company will hire some of the project's participants after the training with a yearly salary as high as 1 million yuan ($142,900).

"Inciting confrontations in S.China Sea part of US ‘isolate China’ strategynThe guided-missile frigate Hengyang (Hull 568) attached to a destroyer flotilla with the navy under the PLA Southern Theater Command fires its close-in weapons system at a mock sea target during a maritime live-fire training exercise in waters of the South China Sea on June 18, 2020. (eng.chinnmil.com.cn/Photo by Li Wei) Following a rare move to send two aircraft carriers to the South China Sea, the US threw down the gauntlet to China again by issuing a statement on Monday that alleged most of Beijing's claims in the sea are ""completely unlawful,"" in an apparent attempt to sow discord between China and littoral countries, and undermine the hard-won stability in the region.Despite the US - still plagued by the COVID-19 epidemic - losing the support of more and more allies amid the deteriorating China-US ties, the superpower has never stopped its ambitions to isolate China by unremittingly launching ideological, technological and trade wars in a bid to maintain its dominance in the world.In the latest statement, the US overturned its long-held somewhat neutral policy on the sovereignty over the South China Sea and accused China of using intimidation to undermine the sovereign rights of Southeast Asian coastal states in the waters and replacing international law with ""might makes right.""Facing closer contacts between China and ASEAN members in recent years, especially the progress achieved on the South China Sea conflicts since 2016 and combined efforts to fight the global health crisis, the US seemed to intend to show, via the statement, that the lord of the world is hastening to strengthen its strategy featuring China as its imaginary enemy, as its Indo-Pacific Strategy Report released in 2019 envisaged.Analysts warned that the odds are the US and China might enter into direct conflict in the waters due to misjudgment, like the clash between a Chinese fighter jet and a US reconnaissance aircraft in 2001. And if the US continues to adopt such a strategy, competition between the two major powers in the sea will increasingly resemble a cold war. The Type 054A guided-missile frigate Yulin (Hull 569) and the Type 052D guided-missile destroyer Hohhot (Hull 161) attached to a destroyer flotilla with the navy under the PLA Southern Theater Command steam in a stern formation during a maritime maneuver operation in waters of the South China Sea on June 18, 2020. (eng.chinnmil.com.cn/Photo by Li Hongming) Coming on the fourth anniversary of the South China Sea ""arbitration,"" the US statement criticized China for bullying Southeast Asian coastal states out of offshore resources and asserting unilateral dominion. The US criticism was seen by Western analysts as a full-throated endorsement of the tribunal's ruling.The US statement followed a call issued on Monday by Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. for compliance with the arbitration ruling.China has solemnly declared that the award is null and void and has no binding force. China neither accepts nor recognizes it. Beijing and Manila have reached consensus on shelving the decision of the South China Sea arbitration since the second half of 2016.""The timing proved that Washington has taken advantage of opposition in the Philippines and other countries to sow discord. It is trying to instigate ASEAN members to be tougher against Beijing in terms of the South China Sea issue,"" Chen Xiangmiao, a research fellow at the Hainan Province-based National Institute for South China Sea Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday.China's conflicts with Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia on the South China Sea had been declining since 2016. Positive momentum has been built toward the resolution of maritime disputes.In 2019, progress was made via a dual-track approach on multilateral and bilateral levels. Disputes between China and the other claimant states, including the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei, were controlled and stability was generally maintained in the South China Sea.However, the situation has changed. The South China Sea issue became a focal point grabbing headlines in major international media outlets, and occupying space on the agenda of many bilateral and multilateral political summits and academic conferences. Conflicts between China and Vietnam and Malaysia over oil and gas development, and maritime jurisdiction have worsened.""With faster progress in negotiating the text of the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC), and the close cooperation between China and Southeast Asia in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, the US shook its legs,"" Chen said, noting that the US has tried to intensify its competition with China for influence and leadership in the region, and new turbulence is on the horizon.Negotiations over the COC may encounter unexpected hurdles, he predicted.The US has always regarded itself as a loyal defender of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and thought it has the responsibility to safeguard the freedom of navigation and overflight, and to maintain global maritime peace.With the support of the alliance and partner countries, the US is the owner of modern international institutional powers and has the right to interpret the rules of international law, which observers believe are the reasons why the country has the courage to stick its nose into China on the South China Sea issue in the past decades. The Chinese Embassy in the US and the Chinese Foreign Ministry rebuked the statement on Tuesday, saying that the US is not a country directly involved in the disputes, but continues to interfere in the issue. In the name of preserving stability, the US is flexing its muscles, stirring up tensions and inciting confrontations in the region.Under the pretext of endorsing rules, the US is using the Convention to attack China while refusing to ratify the UNCLOS itself. Under the pretext of upholding freedom of navigation and overflight, the US is recklessly infringing on other countries' territorial sea and airspace, and throwing its weight around in every ocean of the world, the Chinese Embassy said.The international community sees exactly who is trying to build a ""maritime empire."" The behavior of the US has exposed its naked logic of power and hegemony, and it is the US which is a disrupter and troublemaker of peace and stability in the region, analysts noted.Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, said it is clear that the US is instigating the world, especially countries neighboring China, to increase their confrontations with China, and further decouple from China.The US and Malaysia are not allies, and there is no treaty obligation for the US to protect the country. ""It is evident that the US is telling Malaysia that you do not have to be afraid of confronting China. I am supporting you. "" Wu told the Global Times on Tuesday, noting that it is an old trick played by the US to fool other nations and turn them into pawns. Xisha Islands in the South China Sea Photo: VCG Experts predicted that the US can be anticipated to step up military activities, make more forward deployments, and take provocative actions related to the South China Sea issue more often, reminding Southeast Asian countries not to fall in a ""geopolitical trap"" thus become a victim of the US' strategy to contain China.Close cooperation between the US and Vietnam on the South China Sea issue may create a new ""black swan"" event, Chen said.Since China and Vietnam confronted each other on the Wan'an Tan in 2019, US diplomats and media outlets have frequently voiced their support for Vietnam. The two countries seized this opportunity to step up their defense and security cooperation on intelligence sharing, port calls by military vessels, and arms aid.Vietnam, which holds the ASEAN rotating presidency and a non-permanent seat in the UN Security Council in 2020, may take new steps to internationalize and expand the South China Sea issue, analysts predicted.They suggested China prepare for the worst as the US may take Vietnam as its new ""agent"" in destabilizing the South China Sea, and use the Asian country as an important base for forward deployment of its military and coast guard, stepping up intelligence gathering, reconnaissance, and containment of Chinese activities in the South China Sea.China has reiterated that China's oil and gas development and fishing activities in the South China Sea are all carried out in waters under China's jurisdiction. China has always been committed to negotiating with countries surrounding the South China Sea to shelve maritime disputes, and promote joint development of oil and gas resources.Maritime claims are just one of several areas where the administration of Donald Trump has turned increasingly aggressive to China, amid a swath of issues ranging from technology and national security, to borderland and Hong Kong affairs.The next battlefield that the US aims to besiege China might be in Central Asia in the name of human rights, Wu said.He also predicted the US will also likely shift more of its resources to the Taiwan Straits and create more trouble there.

"Maiden voyage of China’s first amphibious assault ship coming soon: reportnChina held a launch ceremony for its first Type 075 amphibious assault ship in Shanghai on September 25, 2019. Photo: 81.cn The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy 's first Type 075 amphibious assault ship, which is believed to be built to play a vital role in island seizing operations, is expected to soon make its maiden voyage, as outfitting work is progressing smoothly, media reported on Tuesday, at a time when Taiwan island is holding its annual Han Kuang exercises.Having caught a minor fire in April, the under-construction Chinese warship did not suffer any major damage, which showed the ship's superior damage control mechanism over the USS Bonhomme Richard. The latter caught a major fire on Sunday, which analysts said may render the US warship beyond repair.Latest photos circulated on Chinese mainland social media show that the construction of the first Type 075 amphibious assault ship, which was launched in September 2019 in Shanghai and started outfitting work since then, is nearly completed, as the scaffolds on the ship's superstructure have been removed, Singaporean news outlet Lianhe Zaobao reported on Tuesday.It recently underwent cleaning, indicating that its first sea trial could be coming soon, the report said.The report added that the Type 075's recent construction progress is happening at a time of Taiwan island's Han Kuang exercises, which started on Monday. Citing experts, it said that the Type 075 can be used in a reunification-by-force operation by the PLA, and the amphibious warship's progress can serve as a warning to Taiwan secessionists and recent US arms sales to the island.Judging from the photos, the construction of the Type 075 is progressing according to the normal pattern of shipbuilding. So it is not likely related to the ongoing Han Kuang exercises. But from a wider perspective, the ship will be a powerful addition to the PLA's arsenal if Taiwan is to be reunified by force, a Beijing-based military expert told the Global Times on Tuesday on the condition of anonymity.This type of vessel can also be used to safeguard territorial integrity and sovereignty in the South China Sea, the expert said.A second Type 075 was launched in Shanghai in April.Also in April, the first Type 075 caught on fire in a minor accident. But well-informed sources told the Global Times then that it was not significant and would not have any major impact on further construction.Compared to China's Type 075, the USS Bonhomme Richard, an amphibious assault ship that was undergoing renovation at a port in San Diego, California, was not as fortunate. A devastating fire broke out on the ship on Sunday, which has not been extinguished after nearly two days.The US warship might end up beyond repair, news website Business Insider reported, citing US military experts.Accidents are normal, and sometimes inevitable in ship construction, but damage control mechanisms should be applied to contain any major impact, the Chinese expert said, noting that China's shipbuilding industry pays heavy attention to production safety.

"Lockheed Martin faces China's sanctions over Taiwan dealnUS F-35 fighter jet. Photo: VCG RELATED ARTICLES: US firms with Taiwan arms sales to be sanctioned China will impose sanctions on US-based arms producer Lockheed Martin, the main contractor of the recertification of its Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) air defense missiles of the island of Taiwan.The sanctions will likely feature the cut-off of material supply including rare earths, which are crucial to advanced weapons production, and business restrictions on Lockheed Martin's suppliers that have business in the Chinese mainland, Chinese aviation industry experts said on Tuesday.The US on Thursday announced the approval of an arms deal to Taiwan involving the recertification of PAC-3 air defense missiles at an estimated cost of $620 million.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a regular press conference on Tuesday that China had decided to take necessary measures to impose sanctions on the US company.Zhao did not elaborate on the details of the sanctions.Lockheed Martin is an arms producer focused on advanced weapons and equipment, and China does not have many direct business with the company, Wang Ya'nan, a Chinese aviation industry expert and chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times on Tuesday.However, it is possible that China will restrict the supply chain of Lockheed Martin, as the company would inevitably import raw materials including non-metals, metals and minerals including rare earths from China, via its suppliers who do have businesses with China, Wang said.Other component manufacturers and system designers that are related to China could also be restricted from doing business with Lockheed Martin as part of the sanctions, Wang said.Many of Lockheed Martin's key products, including F-35 fighter jets and Patriot missiles, rely on components made with rare earths, analysts said. China is the world's largest rare-earth exporter , and the US imports about 80 percent of its rare-earth needs from China, reports said.Also, the UK's defense ministry revealed in 2019 that Exception PCB, a Chinese-owned company, was making circuit boards for F-35 fighter jets, the UK's Sky News reported at the time. The parts ""control many of the F-35's core capabilities,"" the network reported.Though not large scale, Lockheed Martin has some business in China in new energy, civilian aviation and space industries, according to Weihutang, a program on military affairs affiliated with China Central Television.""Actual effects aside, this is a political statement. US wantonness won't be unchecked when it comes to China,"" He Weiwen, an executive council member of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Lockheed Martin has thus become the first US company since the start of the China-US trade war to be directly designated by Chinese authorities for sanctions, according to He.Previously, although China has said it would roll out an unreliable entity list as a response to foreign governments' and companies' crackdowns on Chinese companies, no actual foreign company had been named by a top Chinese government official, He noted.Wang said that the sanctions will deter other US arms firms from selling arms to the island of Taiwan, and unlike Lockheed Martin, companies like Boeing may get hit even harder in potential sanctions because they have more direct business ties with China.This is not the first time that China has imposed sanctions on US arms producers that are involved in weapons sales to the island of Taiwan.For instance, after the US government approved a plan to sell $2.22 billion of arms to Taiwan in July 2019, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China would impose sanctions on US enterprises participating in the sales. The companies included Raytheon, General Dynamics, and BAE and Oshkosh , according to media investigations.China is resolutely against US arms sales to the island of Taiwan and any form of military connection between the island and the US, Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, China's cabinet, said on Tuesday.The attempts of the Democratic Progressive Party authority to seek ""independence by force"" will not succeed, and will only sabotage peace and stability and bring about a bigger catastrophe to Taiwan people, Zhu warned.

"PLA’s upgraded Type 052D destroyer makes training debut in E.China Sea amid tensions in Taiwan StraitsnThe PLA Navy guided missile destroyer Zibo (Hull 156) conducts exercises in waters of East China Sea in early July 2020. Photo: navy.81.cn Amid rising tensions across the Taiwan Straits with the US military's increasingly frequent operations in the region, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy recently held drills in the East China Sea, with the latest, more powerful, anti-stealth aircraft-capable version of the Type 052D destroyer making its first public appearance, according to military reports over the weekend.In early July, a destroyer flotilla affiliated with the PLA Eastern Theater Command Navy conducted training exercises at an undisclosed location in the East China Sea. The training subjects included air and missile defenses, attacks on surface vessels, and joint anti-submarine operations, the PLA Daily reported on Sunday.According to more details released in a statement and photos posted by the PLA East China Sea Fleet on Friday, the drills featured the guided missile destroyer Zibo, which has the hull number 156, among several other warships.Having entered military service on January 12, the Zibo is the PLA Navy's first ship of the improved version of the Type 052D destroyer, which is dubbed the Type 052DL, reads an article on the website of the government of Zibo, the city in East China's Shandong Province the destroyer is named after.This is the first time the Zibo was seen in action according to a publicly available report, observers noted.Compared to the original Type 052D, the Type 052DL has a longer helicopter deck, and is equipped with a new, meter wave long-range radar on its after-mast, the article said, noting the improvements enable the destroyer to carry China's most advanced Z-20 ship-born helicopter, and to better cope with hostile stealth warplanes.The exercises came at a time when tensions are rising across the Taiwan Straits, as the US not only approved a new arms sale to Taiwan on Thursday, but also sent a destroyer to waters north of the island of Taiwan and conducted close-up reconnaissance on the Chinese mainland on Friday, according to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI), a Beijing-based think tank.The US frequently sent military aircraft and vessels to and near Taiwan since June, and Taiwan is also set to hold its annual Han Kuang exercise on Monday.The US military will likely play a part in Taiwan's Han Kuang exercise, as it has secretly sent military personnel to participate in past occasions, and the US and Taiwan secessionists are planning to cooperate in resisting a potential Taiwan reunification-by-force operation by the PLA, Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, told the Global Times on Sunday.PLA naval drills can serve as a deterrent to US reconnaissance operations, and also send a warning to Taiwan secessionists, Li said, noting the PLA is prepared for all options.Just like the US' close-up reconnaissance on China, the PLA can also conduct similar operations on US bases in the Asia-Pacific region, observers said.

"US arms sales to Taiwan more ‘symbolic’ than of military value: expertnFile photo:VCG File photo:Xinhua Rising tensions After stirring up tensions in the Taiwan Straits by frequently sending military aircraft and warships near the island, and meeting countermeasures by the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the US on Thursday announced the approval of yet another arms deal to Taiwan involving the recertification of air defense missiles for $620 million.The move shows the US is advancing its plans to contain the Chinese mainland regardless of the issues it has with handling the coronavirus at home, and it will lead to more chaos and complexity to the region instead of peace and stability, Chinese mainland experts said on Friday.The arms sales will not change the power balance across the Taiwan Straits, in which the PLA holds an overwhelming advantage, but will only give Taiwan secessionists false courage, the experts said, noting the missiles will be among the first targets to be eradicated if a military operation is needed.The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) of the US announced Thursday that the US State Department approved a request by Taiwan for the recertification of its Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) air defense missiles, at an estimated cost of $620 million.The recertification package the US is offering Taiwan includes replacing PAC-3 components that are near expiration, testing and repairing the capability and spare parts for ground support equipment, and other logistics support, US media Defense News reported on Friday.This marks the second time that the US has approved arms sales to Taiwan this year. The US had previously approved the sale of 18 MK-48 Mod 6 advanced technology heavyweight torpedoes to Taiwan on May 20.Already in service, the PAC-3 air defense missiles are an important weapon in Taiwan's high-altitude defense systems, which are deployed in Taiwan's major cities and surround Taiwan's important military facilities. The PAC-3 is the most advanced model, with a maximum interception range of 70 kilometers, and maximum interception altitude of over 24 kilometers. The search range of its radar is 100 kilometers, and can track 100 targets at the same time.According to US military contractor Lockheed Martin, the PAC-3 is capable of intercepting tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft.Yang Chengjun, a Chinese mainland expert on missile technology and nuclear strategy, told the Global Times that the arms sale is symbolic, and only gives Taiwan secessionists false courage, rather than boosts its military capabilities.Compared to the PAC-2 air defense missiles, the preparation time required for the PAC-3 is shorter. It can finish its launch preparations in 60 minutes, and its interception chances are also improved. The interception probability has reached as high as 80 percent in some missile tests, but this data was taken under strict conditions, when the launch time, location, and flight trajectory of the targeted projectile have already been predicted, Yang said.Yang pointed out that if the Chinese mainland decides to use force to reunify with Taiwan, the PAC-3 will not be useful since the specific time and location of our missile launches are unpredictable. The mainland will deploy a combination of military means, such as air and water raids. ""At the moment, the Chinese PLA's conventional missiles can be used for mobile operations, and their launch preparation time is very short, meaning the PAC-3 could not react in time. Considering their success rate of launch and limitations to interception, there is a much more symbolic meaning to the arms sales, rather than actual military value,"" Yang said.Yang added that if the Chinese mainland decides to reunify with Taiwan by force, it will be a comprehensive application of multiple means, rather than just missiles. The armed forces, including the navy, army and air force, will all attack. That means Taiwan may need to buy at least 30,000 PAC-3 missiles.Nevertheless, the PAC-3 systems will possess a certain level of threat to PLA aircraft and could intercept some missiles, so they will likely be some of the first targets to be destroyed in a potential military operation, analysts said.Beijing-based military expert Wei Dongxu told the Global Times on Friday that by selling overpriced arms to Taiwan, the US has three evil intentions: create trouble between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan island (to contain China), use Taiwan's military as a shield to block PLA missiles for US fleets, and earn dirty money for US arms firms.The US arms sales announcement came after the US frequently sent military aircraft and vessels to and near Taiwan since June.In an apparent response, the PLA also frequently conducted warplane sorties near Taiwan. Multiple types of PLA warplanes, and Su-30 and J-10 fighter jets, Y-8 special mission aircraft, and H-6K bombers were involved.For these, the Taiwan Straits was listed as a region with a deteriorating situation by the International Crisis Group.This has led to discussions by observers on whether a reunification-by-force operation by the PLA is on the horizon.After the national security legislation for Hong Kong, the US realized it had lost the Hong Kong card to contain China, so it has shifted its focus and allocated more resources to the Taiwan card, analysts said.Fears of a regional military conflict in the Taiwan Straits looms large because of provocative and aggressive actions by the US and Taiwan secessionists, and while the Chinese mainland is willing to find peaceful solutions to the Taiwan question, it has never waived the choice of unifying with Taiwan by force and has been treating it as a main strategic mission objective of the PLA, analysts said, noting the responsibility lies in the US and Taiwan secessionists to stop provocations and de-escalate the situation.Wei said that secessionist forces in Taiwan island rely on the US to achieve their goal of secession, and the US might also further show off its military presence by sending reconnaissance aircraft, anti-submarine aircraft and warships, or even aircraft carriers to locations near Taiwan. But the PLA has the capability and confidence to safeguard peace and stability in the region and stop any foreign military intervention, Wei said.Also on Thursday, the DSCA approved a planned purchase by Japan for 105 F-35 joint strike fighters worth $23 billion.Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday that US arms sales to Taiwan and Japan happen regularly. ""The special thing about this year is that US perception of China's threat is more urgent than ever. The fact that the US arms sales arrangement happened as scheduled amid the pandemic shows that it is speeding up its plans to contain China.""Li believes the political intentions of the US are apparent: it plans to strengthen its regional alliance's confidence in its ability to ensure security. Thus, the US, Japan and Taiwan have gradually formed a military companionship with which the US expects to strangle the Chinese mainland's development.Li said he believes US military plans in the region will have a limited impact on the military balance in East Asia. The arms sale exposes why the US plays up the PLA's military drills in the South China Sea and East China Sea: it hopes to make Japan and Taiwan more dependent on it by hyping the threat of the Chinese mainland.""In the future, the US may further expand its arms sales to Japan and Taiwan to achieve what the US believes is sufficient to constrain the Chinese mainland's military development,"" Li said.Li considers it meaningless whether the US sells arms to Japan or Taiwan; it cannot change the Chinese mainland's dominant position in the region. In other words, its underhanded dealings with Japan and Taiwan will only end up with the region becoming more complicated and chaotic.

"US, Taiwan should not hype war across Straits: Global Times editorialnIllustration: Xia Qing/GT The US State Department has approved a request from the island of Taiwan to recertify the US' Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missiles for an estimated cost of $620 million, according to the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency on Thursday. This is not a large amount compared with the US' previous arms sales to Taiwan. It's an upgrade for Taiwan's PAC-3 missiles, and does not seem that much of an irritant. But analysts have noticed the normalization trend of US arms sales to Taiwan. In the past, the US and Taiwan would save up to make a larger transaction, but now Taiwan buys on demand, and the US approves it.Most military observers believe that with the overwhelming improvement in the Chinese mainland's military power, Taiwan's purchase of any military equipment from the US has lost the actual significance of defense. Taiwan's annual defense budget is only around $11 billion. Deducting personnel and training expenses, the rest of the budget is not even worth mentioning compared to the PLA. Once a war breaks out, the PLA is capable of destroying Taiwan's overall military capabilities within a few hours and capturing the island hours after that. From the army to the people, the mainland has such confidence.Thus, the military issue in the Taiwan Straits is no longer between the mainland and Taiwan, and is not about what military equipment Taiwan buys from the US. For the mainland, US arms sales to Taiwan is one major move to undermine the one-China principle. It is an important sign of the US and Taiwan colluding to escalate tensions in the Taiwan Straits, and also Washington's way to convey its attitude to Beijing - that it will try to dominate the Taiwan question.By purchasing weapons from the US, Taiwan is paying protection fees to the country. The Taiwan military is not determined to really defend Taiwan's security. Taiwan's defense cannot be judged in a traditional way. It is only the result of a strategic balance. Such a balance has become increasingly sensitive because of the mainland's rapidly growing power, the US' unreasonable suppression of the mainland, and turning Taiwan into a pawn to curb the mainland's rise.In the foreseeable future, the most important thing for Taiwan is to properly handle such a special balance. Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party authority has a serious misjudgment. It wrongly believes that it can get everything it wants by purchasing weapons from the US and being a pawn of the US.In a Crisis Watch report published by the International Crisis Group in June, the Taiwan Straits was in the list of ""deteriorated situations."" Taiwan suffers the most if the situation in the Taiwan Straits deteriorates. Once the situation erupts, the mainland and the US will both be harmed, but it may be a complete disaster for Taiwan.We believe that the mainland, the US and Taiwan do not want the Taiwan Straits situation to spark because it benefits nobody. But China-US relations are tense and Taiwan island is hijacked by the Tsai Ing-wen authority's radical policies. The mainland almost has no mutual trust with the US or Taiwan, and all sides are showing their determination to respond to the worst situation. The risk of military conflicts in the Taiwan Straits is the highest in decades. Once the first shot is fired, there is very likely to be large-scale military conflicts caused by strategic misjudgment.Here we warn the US and Taiwan: Do not play with fire in the Taiwan Straits. Once a war breaks out in the region, the mainland will be determined to defend national sovereignty at all costs. Such determination from the mainland overwhelms US attempts to benefit from the situation and Taiwan dissidents' will to seek so-called independence. No one wants a war, but compared to the US and Taiwan, the mainland is less afraid to fight in the region.The US and Taiwan should ease the situation in the Taiwan Straits, instead of pushing the situation to the extreme. Otherwise, just wait for military conflicts to break out one day. "	7/10/20	1	0	-0.9746	-1

Thus, the US, Japan and Taiwan have gradually formed a military companionship which the US expects to more effectively strangle the Chinese mainland's development.Li said he believes the US' military plans in the region will have limited impacts on the military balance in East Asia. The arms sale exposes why the US plays up the PLA's military drills in the South China Sea and East China Sea: it hopes to make Japan and Taiwan more dependent on it by hyping up the threat of the Chinese mainland.""In the future, the US may further expand its arms sales to Japan and Taiwan, to achieve what the US believe is sufficient to constrain the Chinese mainland's military development,"" Li said.Li considers it meaningless whether the US sells arms to Japan or Taiwan; it cannot change the Chinese mainland's dominant position in the region. In other words, its underhanded dealings with Japan and Taiwan will only end up with the region becoming more complicated and chaotic. It will not help the US realize its goal of containing China, Li said.Global Times "	7/10/20	0	0	0.9942	1
"US military's frequent close-up air recons on China's coastal area 'dangerous'nJ-10 fighter jets attached to an aviation brigade of the air force under the PLA Southern Theater Command taxi out of their aircraft hangars successively onto the runway prior to a night field flight training exercise over northwest China's Qilian Mountains and Gobi desert. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Xie Zhongwu) US military aircraft reportedly conducted close-up reconnaissance operations on China's southern coast for three consecutive days, which is a dangerous sign, as the moves could let the US grasp the technical parameters, locations and movements of the Chinese military's weapons and equipment over the South China Sea and Taiwan island, Chinese military experts warned on Wednesday.A US EP-3E signals reconnaissance aircraft on Wednesday morning flew through the Bashi Channel, edged near the ""middle line"" of the Taiwan Straits from the south, then turned southwest and approached the coastal areas of South China's Guangdong Province. At one point, it came only 51.68 nautical miles from Guangdong, Taiwan media reported Wednesday.This is the third consecutive day the US has conducted similar operations. On Monday an RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft and on Tuesday an EP-3E also approached the Guangdong coast, only 60.89 and 60.94 nautical miles away respectively, according to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI), a think tank at Peking University.Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Wednesday that unlike the recent exercises by US dual aircraft carriers in the South China Sea, the reconnaissance aircraft's operations are not just a show, as they were conducting reconnaissance missions in preparation for potential military conflict.Both the EP-3E and RC-135 can capture electromagnetic signals including communication signals, after which they can analyze them and obtain valuable information like the current status of China's weapons and equipment and the latest movements of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), Song said, noting that for instance, an RC-135 could detect ballistic missiles, including the location of their bases and transporter erector launchers.The US is also interested in the movements of Chinese submarines and surface vessels, for which it would also use P-3C and P-8A aircraft, Song said.According to publicly available information, many warships of the PLA South China Sea Fleet are homeported at a naval base in Guangdong's Zhanjiang, and the PLA Southern Theater Command, which has the 74th and 75th Group Army, is also headquartered in Guangdong's Guangzhou.One of the most important missions of the PLA Southern Theater Command and South China Sea Fleet is to safeguard China's interests in the South China Sea, and they would also support the Eastern Theater Command in a potential reunification-by-force operation on the island of Taiwan, observers said.In the past month, the US has also frequently sent military aircraft near the island of Taiwan, which were also frequently met with PLA warplane sorties that were widely interpreted as PLA countermeasures, according to media reports.To defend against the US' provocative close-up reconnaissance, the PLA must have sent warplanes to approach, intercept, disrupt and repel US warplanes, so they would not be able to gather any intelligence. Or the PLA could temporarily suspend military activities when they approach, which would lower the risk of signals being intercepted, Song said.The PLA sortied a variety of advanced fighter jets including J-10, J-11 and Su-30 in missions near Taiwan when US military aircraft approached. Y-8 special mission aircraft for electronic warfare can also be deployed to jam US warplanes, analysts said.Chinese military experts also warned that frequent close-up reconnaissance operations by the US could also result in misjudgment and lead to accidents.In 2001, a PLA J-8II fighter jet collided with a US EP-3E when the latter conducted close-in reconnaissance near South China's Hainan Province. The US aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing in Hainan, and the Chinese J-8II pilot died after the aircraft crashed. "	7/8/20	0	0	-0.0018	-1
"Chinese mainland netizens not ready to forgive Chinese actor Ko Chen-tung’s past drug usenKo Chen-tung Photo: VCG RELATED ARTICLES: Misbehaving celebrities should be held accountable Although Actor Ko Chen-tung from the island of Taiwan, who was arrested six years ago for drug use, attended a movie premiere on Sunday, many netizens in Chinese mainland made it clear that they were not willing to forgive his past misbehavior.Ko attended the premiere in Taiwan of his film A Choo, which was originally scheduled for release in 2014 but was delayed due to the star's arrest. The film is set to hit theaters on the island on July 15.According to a report from guancha.com, Ko cried at the premiere and complained tearfully that he has been experiencing some difficult times over the past few years and that he is trying to be brave.However, many netizens in the Chinese mainland said that they do not think Ko, as an entertainer with a history of drug use, should be able to return to the industry.More than 43,000 netizens took part in a poll posted on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo asking if they support Ko's film and whether Ko should be given another chance. About 93 percent of voters said they refused to do so, while 3,000 netizens were willing to wait for Ko to turn over a new leaf.""Drugs are a line no one can cross. Especially for entertainers with influence among young people, those who take drugs should never enter the industry as their experience will affect teenagers,"" netizen ""AiEven_V"" commented on Sina Weibo.Over the six years since his arrest, Ko has tried to make comebacks on several occasions but all of them were met with a surge of resistance from netizens in the Chinese mainland, the guancha.com report said.He filmed a Chinese drama in 2015, but it was released only recently nd after he acted as a spokesperson for a US cosmetics brand in the island of Taiwan in 2018. Butthe brand was boycotted by netizens on Sina Weibo. "	7/8/20	0	0	-0.9584	-1
"Taipei now under Washington’s deep control: former cross-Straits officialnFile photo of the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan. Photo: Xinhua This year events affecting relations across the Taiwan Straits have not been positive. There were the reelection of secessionist Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen, the election defeat of Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu, politicized and highly inappropriate interactions between the US and the island, and the unfortunate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.High on the list of concerns for the coming years include US meddling in the Taiwan question and how the mess in Hong Kong will affect cross-Straits relations.Global Times reporters (GT) discussed these questions with Wang Zaixi (Wang), former deputy director of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits of the State Council and vice president of National Society of Taiwan Studies, in an exclusive interview.GT: Many analysts attribute Tsai's election victory to the mess in Hong Kong. We have noticed that Hong Kong issues seem to have played an important role in the cross-Straits relations over the last year. What's your take on this?Wang: Two things did objectively help Tsai win the election even though she achieved nothing over the past four years: one was the riots in Hong Kong, the other was the deteriorating China-US relationship.The Tsai authority jumped on the riots that happened in Hong Kong with support from external forces including the US and the UK. It slandered the efforts of Hong Kong police in stopping the riots, calling it a ""crackdown on democracy and freedom."" As most participants of the rioters were local young students, Taiwan media focused mainly on the scenes of Hong Kong police arresting these students, which frightened some young people on the island.Taiwan's separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority smeared the ""one country, two systems"" under that circumstance, which misled and deceived many voters especially the young people.Tsai also intentionally confused the 1992 Consensus with the ""one country, two systems,"" and attacked the island's parties that advocate for improving relations across the Straits suggesting those who are ""pro-China [-mainland] betray Taiwan,"" which left Han Kuo-yu, the Kuomintang (KMT) candidate in a passive position.The 1992 Consensus clearly requires adherence to the one-China principle and seeking national reunification. ""One country, two systems"" is an institutional arrangement that would come after reunification, and is totally different from the 1992 Consensus. Tsai's intentional conflating of the two concepts reflects her sinister motives.GT: Washington has stepped up arms sales to Taipei and has passed several acts friendly to the island in recent years. The two sides even jointly went against the World Health Organization (WHO) amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Do you think Trump's actions are merely aimed at winning reelection or are there some other political ends?Wang: I think these actions are not only about getting reelected, the main purpose is containing China, and Trump would still take these actions even if he wasn't running for reelection. For Washington, playing the ""Taiwan card"" costs little and is very damaging to Beijing.Washington's Taipei-related acts, such as the ""Taiwan Travel Act,"" ""Asia Reassurance Initiative Act,"" and the ""Taipei Act"" which he US Congress passed in recent years, as well as the ""National Defense Authorization Act"" that Trump signed, have made relations between Washington and Taipei a semi-official one. Trump has also sold weapons and equipment worth $13.8 billion to Taiwan, creating conditions for the DPP authority to ""reject unification by force.""The Tsai authority knows that Taiwan cannot compete with the mainland on its own, and therefore turns to Washington and is willingly to be used. Taipei is actually now under Washington's deep control.GT: After a failure in the election at the beginning of this year, KMT's candidate Han Kuo-yu was removed from office in a voter recall vote. It is reported that the US supported the removal of Han, so that US warships can dock at Kaohsiung Port. How will the removal of Han affect relations across the Taiwan Straits, and relations between the island of Taiwan and the US?Wang: The ouster of Han was another disaster for the KMT, and the DPP's separatist dogma will be more aggressive. But the dominance of DPP will also lead to its downfall. Han recognizes the 1992 Consensus and supports improving the Cross-Straits relations . The election of Chen Chi-mai, a DPP member as the mayor of Kaohsiung will cast a negative influence on cross-Straits relations.As far as relations between the island of Taiwan and the US, I believe there would be no big difference under the KMT or DPP rule as they share common ground - they're both pro-US.

"Risks seen in future relations across the Taiwan Strait but overall situation controllable: expertnTsai Ing-wen Photo:VCG This year, events affecting relations across the Taiwan Strait have popped up one after another. There were the reelection of Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen, the removal of Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu, politicized and highly inappropriate interactions between the US and the island, the People's Liberation Army's military exercises in and around the straits, and the unfortunate impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.People on both sides of the strait and around the world are wondering what the trends of cross-Straits relations will be like.In an exclusive interview, Global Times reportersdiscussed the future of cross-strait relations with Wang Zaixi, former deputy director of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait of the State Council and Vice President of National Taiwan Studies Association.How do you compare Tsai Ing-wen's ""inaugural speech"" on May 20 with the one she gave after her election four years ago?Although the cross-Straits relations part in Tsai's May 20 speech was less detailed with an evasive attitude compared to her speech four years ago, there were still some points in the speech that should put us on high alert.First, Tsai said she would deal with cross-Straits relations following Taiwan region's current ""constitution"" and the ""Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area,"" but she also said a ""constitutional amendment committee,"" would be established implying that the ""constitution"" can be revised at any time. In that case, Tsai's promise to follow the ""constitution"" would be nonsense.Second, Tsai pretty much avoided the 1992 Consensus, only reiterating words about ""peace, reciprocity, democracy and dialogue"" in her speech. The latter two words clear show her attempt to turn cross-Straits relations into a discussion between two countries.Third, Tsai flagrantly called the island ""Republic of China, Taiwan"" instead of ""Republic of China,"" which suggests an intent to create an independent Taiwan and legally separate it from the mainland, and to realize her goal of ""Taiwanization"" - that is, ""de-sinicization"" of the island.KMT's report on the reasons for its election defeat released in January had many different reactions inside the Blue Camp. How do you view the KMT report, and the ""four pillars"" mentioned in the report?The KMT report, which has some serious problems, has been questioned inside the KMT and the Blue Camp. Even some KMT seniors expressed different opinions on the report. I believe there are three major questions. First, it failed to find the real reason for its two consecutive electoral failures, which is rooted in the disunity inside the party. There were some twists in choosing a candidate before Han was chosen. And that decision wasn't unanimously supported inside the KMT, which led to Han fighting the campaign on his own. Han was attacked more from his Party than the DDP.After Tsai Ing-wen beat Lai Ching-te to be the DDP candidate, there were not dissenting voices inside of the DDP.It's absurd for KMT to blame its failure on the 1992 Consensus.Second, the 1992 Consensus can be updated but cannot be abandoned. Ma Ying-jeou opened a new horizon in Cross-Straits exchanges, and achieved peaceful development and established the direct mail, transport and trade links during his eight-year rule. The DPP still cannot give up the bonus from the signing of Cross-Straits Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement. It is ironic that the KMT chose not to refute this when Tsai attacked the 1992 Consensus as a ""one country, two systems.""Third, the ""four pillars"" is wrong, which essentially is Lee Teng-hui's ""special state-to-state relations."" The ""Four pillars"" runs counter to the 1992 Consensus. There's no doubt that vote was important. However, abandoning its political stance just to win more votes is not worthwhile for KMT.Some people think the KMT won't recover from this series of hits and won't regain power for a long time. What is your opinion?That's not necessarily true. The key is for the KMT to transform itself - can it find the right position and grasp the opportunity to regain the office the next time.As the DPP has been long in power, corruption, ""black gold"" politics and power division will spread. Most voters won't stand for a one-horse race, and the US also dislikes a party holding power for a long time. Moreover, the DPP is a political party that is ""good at getting elected but bad at ruling."" It believes that as long as the DPP destroys opposition parties, it can stay in the office as long as it wants. But that's impossible.Han was removed, and there will be alternatives.The DPP has its advantages during elections, but it also has disadvantages: can't deal with the cross-Straits relations, the Taiwan economy nor international society.The KMT has a history of 126 years with rich experience and talent. It now needs to solve four problems: internal unification, maintaining the young generation, finding its development direction and right position, and change its image of ""bigwigs"" to one that is more acceptable to the public. If the KMT follows the DPP, it will not have a future.How do you see the impact of the pandemic on the cross-Straits relations this year? What is your opinion on DPP's so-called ""epidemic diplomacy""?The pandemic has caused a huge impact on cross-Straits relations as Washington and Taipei have had frequent interactions and ""tacit cooperation"" during the virus outbreak. The Tsai administration cooperated with Washington in blaming the mainland for the pandemic, saying COVID-19 originated in Wuhan. Even now some Taiwan-based media still call the COVID-19 disease the ""Wuhan pneumonia,"" which clearly shows their [ill will].In the pandemic, Washington not only mobilized US companies to leave the Chinese mainland but also forced Taiwan's high-tech enterprises that had invested in the mainland, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSMC, to leave the mainland for the US. Meanwhile, Washington sent a message congratulating Tsai on the commencement of second term in office in the name of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and announced the sale of arms and equipment to Taipei, which emboldened the separatists on the island.As a result, Tsai, who thinks she enjoys the support of the Taiwan pubic and Washington, has taken a tougher stance on cross-Straits relations this year since the pandemic has broken out in the mainland. Tsai has set stricter restrictions on cross-Straits exchanges, and has taken a more adamant approach to ""Taiwan independence."" It is abundantly clear that Tsai is ""seeking independence with the pandemic"" and using the virus' spread to prevent cross-Straits exchanges.I think Taipei's ""epidemic diplomacy"", which is costing the DPP authority a lot of [time and money], has had little effect.Gloating over the virus outbreak in Wuhan earlier this year, the Tsai authority announced a ban on the export of masks and other virus-fighting supplies to the mainland, when the mainland was at the height of the epidemic. Nonetheless, after the virus spread globally, Tsai deployed her so-called ""mask diplomacy"" claiming in April the island would donate 10 million masks to others, and to provide weekly 100,000 masks to the US.With Washington's support, Tsai also attempted to squeeze into the WHO by publicizing the island's ""virus-fighting experience"" and its ""contribution to the international community"" during the pandemic. This attempt later ended in failure, showing the solid foundation of the one-China principle in the international community.PLA fighter jets have been flying near the island of Taiwan. In March it conducted nighttime exercises for the first time and the sorties became quite frequent in June. How do you read the actions of the PLA?PLA fighter jets flying near Taiwan are normal. The meaning is to declare the sovereignty of China over Taiwan, to deter ""Taiwan independence"" forces, and to conduct routine military training. The frequency is related to the situation on the island and the environment nearby.What do you expect cross-Straits relations will be like over the next four years?It will be tough and complex with more variables and risks, but the overall situation is controllable.

"Call for TCM to be renamed 'Taiwan medicine' slammed onlinenPharmacists dispense traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) at a TCM pharmacy in Suzhou, East China's Jiangsu Province on January 6. Photo: CFP A recent suggestion made by Yu Shyi-kun, Taiwan Island's legislative head and also member of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), to change the term ""Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)"" to ""Traditional Taiwan Medicine"" at a TCM academic seminar on Sunday led to a wave of mockery among netizens and experts.The speaker claimed that TCM only has a history of 100 years, and suggested calling it ""Taiwan medicine"" instead of ""Chinese medicine.""Netizens from the Chinese mainland and Taiwan Island slammed the comment for its ""towering ignorance"", with many saying it was nothing more than a clumsily disguised expression of support for separating the island from the mainland.Han medicine is called traditional Korean medicine in the Korea Peninsula, Kampo medicine in Japan and traditional Vietnamese medicine in Vietnam. Only in Taiwan is it now called Traditional Chinese Medicine, he said, suggesting the name be changed to ""Taiwan medicine.""Trying to change how people refer to TCM cannot truly cut links with ""China,"" netizens said, as even the general public know that although TCM is called different names in other countries, it all originates from TCM theory.This kind of political manipulation advocating opposition to ""China"" and ""desinification"" drew strong resentment among the public on Taiwan Island.Some satirically asked the DPP authorities if people of Taiwan Island would be able to celebrate the Spring Festival in the future, eat dumplings or even write Chinese characters.Some experts wrote on social media that as the mainland's influence continues to rise and Chinese culture gains popularity around the world, the political advocacy of ""desinification"" will only provoke social disputes and make the island lose its competitiveness.Global Times "	7/6/20	0	0	0.3494	1
"Rare US dual aircraft carrier drills in South China Sea ‘a show’ for alliesnThe guided-missile frigate Hengyang (Hull 568) and the guided-missile destroyer Wuhan (Hull 169) attached to a destroyer flotilla with the navy under the PLA Southern Theater Command steam alongside with each other during a maritime maneuver operation in waters of the South China Sea on June 18, 2020. (eng.chinnmil.com.cn/Photo by Li Wei) At a time when relations between China and the US are further deteriorating over a series of topics including trade, the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan and Hong Kong, the US has deployed two aircraft carriers and other warships to the South China Sea for its largest-scale exercises in the region in years, which also coincided with Chinese military drills taking place in the same area and time frame.The two US aircraft carrier battle groups are nothing more than paper tigers on China's doorsteps, as the region is fully within the grasp of People's Liberation Army (PLA) with specially made weapons that can destroy aircraft carrier, and US drills are a mere show to make up for its loss of face regarding epidemic control, and indicated it knows it has lost its Hong Kong card following China's national security legislation, forcing it to shift focus to the South China Sea and Taiwan to contain China, analysts said on Sunday.The PLA is conducting intensive drills and has recently tested a new naval missile in the Bohai Sea, and is ready to defend against aggression, reports said.The USS Ronald Reagan and USS Nimitz aircraft carriers are holding large-scale exercises in the South China Sea together with four other warships starting Saturday, CNN reported on Saturday.Since the South China Sea arbitration in 2016, the US has not conducted joint operations featuring two carriers near the South China Sea. According to Zhengzhijian, a WeChat public account run by Beijing Youth Daily, the last time two US carriers conducted exercises in the South China Sea was in 2014.Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday that the US move aimed at enhancing its military presence in the West Pacific, is designed to show off that its hegemony in the region is unshakable, and boost confidence for its regional allies.Beijing-based naval expert Li Jie told the Global Times that the US is pushing its aircraft carriers onto the frontlines to show its military power remains the strongest in the world despite having been hit hard by the COVID-19 epidemic. It was once left with no aircraft carrier to use in the Asia Pacific region for more than two months.The US is also attempting to deter PLA movements in the South China Sea and on the Taiwan question , Song said.The US has been playing its Hong Kong card to contain China's development for the past years, but after the national security law for Hong Kong came into effect on Tuesday, it's well aware that it has lost this card, so the US has shifted its focus to the South China Sea and Taiwan, in which military might plays an important role, analysts said.

(eng.chinnmil.com.cn/Photo by Li Wei) Not only are US exercises with two aircraft carriers in the South China Sea rare, it's also rare that China is also holding drills in the South China Sea in the same time frame.According to a notice released by China's Maritime Safety Administration, the Chinese drills, also in the South China Sea, near the Xisha Islands, run from Wednesday to Sunday.In separate operations, the PLA has been conducting intensive drills in the South China Sea, East China Sea, and Yellow Sea recently, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Saturday. Advanced warships including Type 052D guided missile destroyers and Type 054A guided missile frigates were involved.In the Bohai Sea, the PLA Navy recently test launched an undisclosed new type of missile, CCTV reported on Saturday. The report did not elaborate on the missile's purpose, but footage suggests it can be launched from a warship.Three US aircraft carriers have been conducting exercises in the Philippine Sea just outside the South China Sea since June, which has stirred up regional tensions, Chinese military observers said, noting that Chinese drills are regularly scheduled exercises aimed at safeguarding China's territorial integrity and sovereignty and do not target any other country.The South China Sea is fully within the grasp of the PLA, and any US aircraft carrier movement in the region is closely watched and taken aim at by the PLA, which has a wide range of anti-aircraft carrier weapons like the DF-21D and DF-26, which are both regarded as ""aircraft carrier killer"" missiles, analysts noted.Song said that it's unrealistic for the US to wage a war against China with just two aircraft carriers in the South China Sea, and it's very unlikely the two sides could accidentally spark a conflict due to the drills.The US drills are just a show performed for its West Pacific allies and Taiwan secessionists, and the Chinese drills are meant to bolster the PLA's combat capabilities, Song said, noting that the PLA can conduct surveillance missions on US drills, and expel US surveillance attempts using proper measures.In response to a Pentagon statement on Thursday that accused Chinese drills in the Xisha Islands of being ""counter-productive to efforts at easing tensions and maintaining stability,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a regular press conference on Friday that the Xisha Islands are indisputably part of China's inherent territory.China's military exercises in the seas off Xisha Islands are within our sovereignty and beyond reproach, Zhao said, noting that the fundamental cause of instability in the South China Sea is due to large-scale military activities and flexing of muscles by some non-regional country that lies tens of thousands of miles away.

"Expert refutes describing jurisdiction exercise of central govt office in HK as a 'delivery to Chinese mainland'nThe Hong Kong Celebrations Association, a non-profit organization, held various activities to celebrate the passage of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland. Photo: China News Service China's State Council Friday announced the appointment of a director and deputy directors for the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the central government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), which is the fourth institute the central government set up in the region.The other three are the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, the People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison and the office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the HKSAR.Although clear answers to when the central government's Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong shall enforce the law can be found in the national security law for Hong Kong, some Hong Kong media still used the term ""song zhong"", which means ""delivery to Chinese mainland"", to describe its actions.Opponents of the extradition bill described their protest movement as ""fan song zhong"" - anti-delivery to Chinese mainland. As ""Song zhong"" is also a homophone for the phrase meaning ""to see off a dying relative,"" ""fan song zhong"" in Chinese has the same pronunciation as ""anti-sending to death.""Tang Fei, a member of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, said the term was originally ""political rhetoric"" taught by some Taiwan secessionists to the Hong Kong opposition.""Whether it's said in Cantonese or Putonghua, the opposition tried to use the term to imply that people that were sent back to the mainland is similar to being sent to death. Their intentions are extremely vicious,"" Tang said.Regarding the appointment announced on Friday, Tang said that it indicated the meaning of ""the staff of the Office shall be jointly dispatched"" as regulated in the 48th article of the national security law for Hong Kong.""Zheng Yanxiong [who has been appointed as the director of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the central government in the HKSAR] used to work locally and shows comprehensive experience in various aspects; he also has working experience in the political and legal system. Not to mention that he is also a Guangdong native and can speak Cantonese,"" Tang said, noting that these capabilities give Zheng an advantage in coordinating work.Li Jiangzhou, who is appointed as a deputy director of the office, is from the Ministry of Public Security and had worked in the liaison office before. He is professional and familiar with the Hong Kong's situation, so he can assist Zheng in implementing work that he is professional at, Tang said.Publicized information about another deputy director Sun Qingye is not easily accessible. Some people believe that he has a background working in national security agencies. Overall, it is a team containing professionals in various fields.The national security law for Hong Kong defines mandates for the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the central government in Hong Kong:(1) analysing and assessing developments in relation to safeguarding national security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and providing opinions and making proposals on major strategies and important policies for safeguarding national security;(2) overseeing, guiding, coordinating with, and providing support to the Region in the performance of its duties for safeguarding national security;(3) collecting and analysing intelligence and information concerning national security; and(4) handling cases concerning offence endangering national security in accordance with the law.Tang said that the four mandates are paratactic without differentiation between priority and others. ""The first three mandates are more like daily responsibilities while the forth would be carried out when the situation is serious, if the central government 'has to take action,' which we are not hoping to see,"" he said.Article 55 of the national security law for Hong Kong clarifies situations when the central government office in Hong Kong can exercise jurisdiction over a case.Tang noted that the provisions in the national security law are not the same thing as so-called ""song zhong."" Firstly, the extradition bill did not target national security crimes, but certain serious economic crimes and criminal cases. Secondly, the crime location and handling procedures of the main crimes targeted by the national security law and the extradition bill are also completely different.Will the office propose and report to the central government for approval to exercise jurisdiction without informing the HKSAR government? Will there be a situation where the HKSAR government is unaware and thus undermines its governance? Regarding such questions, Tang believes that there is no need to worry at all.Even in this situation, it does not mean that the central government and the office in Hong Kong will not inform the HKSAR government because there is a national security advisor in the HKSAR committee for safeguarding national security. Meanwhile, the national security law for Hong Kong also stipulates coordination, information sharing and cooperation.It means that all agencies will keep close contact in safeguarding national security, he said.What's notable is that the 54th article of the national security law for Hong Kong calls for ""necessary measures to strengthen the management of and services for organs of foreign countries and international organizations in the Region, as well as non-governmental organizations and news agencies of foreign countries.""Tang said that from a long time in the past Western countries led by the US have infringed into Hong Kong via non-governmental organizations under the disguise of ""charity,"" ""academia"" and ""religious communication,"" behind which hides informants from western governments and even military intelligence units.The situation is similar to foreign news agencies. There is no management rule for news agencies in Hong Kong currently. Anybody can claim themselves to be an ""individual journalist"" or ""citizen journalist"". Under these circumstances, authorities can do nothing even if they know certain institutes are suspected to be spy agencies.But now the national security law for Hong Kong provides legal basis to manage these foreign non-profit organizations and news agencies, Tang said. He noted that such management is normal and western countries are also doing the same.""The key is not to supervise these organizations, but to supervise whether they violate the law, interfere in Hong Kong's internal affairs or damage China's national security.""Supervision over staff of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the central government in the HKSAR also drew public attention.According to the 50th article of the law, the staff of the Office shall abide by the laws of the HKSAR as well as national laws.Article 60 says that the acts performed in the course of duty by the Office and its staff in accordance with this law shall not be subject to the jurisdiction of the HKSAR.Tang explained that staff of the office are dispatched by the central government so it's impossible for local governments to supervise them. But this does not mean that the staff would not be under supervision. They would be supervised as Article 50 stipulates. Tang believes that the department above the office would also supervise and manage the office. "	7/6/20	0	0	0.9951	1

Observers noted that this is very unusual in recent years, and as the US is trying more aggressively to expand or even normalize its military presence in the region, the Chinese mainland will surely increase its military presence as well to monitor them and push them out if necessary. The risk of conflict will rise but since the US, so far, has sent only unarmed reconnaissance aircraft to enter the airspace, the possibility of crossfire in the air remained low, said Wei. After China's top national legislature proposed national security legislation for Hong Kong in May, the Trump administration knows it has ""lost another card"" to provoke China and dares not to overly retaliate, so it has started to use its ""last card - Taiwan,"" Lü noted. But the last card is also the most dangerous one as China has drawn the bottom-line very clearly, and if the Trump administration miscalculates China and thinks using Taiwan to provoke China could be helpful for the November presidential election, the cross-Straits situation could potentially become extremely dangerous in the latter half of this year, Lü said.

The formation flew over the Miyako Strait and Bashi Channel, completing an island patrol, the subject of the training. (Xinhua/Wu Yuepeng) Two bombers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) reportedly approached the island of Taiwan from the east after crossing the Miyako Strait on Sunday, after PLA aircraft conducted at least eight sorties to Taiwan's southwestern ""airspace"" in June alone.The two H-6K bombers on Sunday flew through the Miyako Strait from the East China Sea, entered the Pacific Ocean, approached Taiwan Island from the east, then returned to base via the same route, according to a press release by Japan's Defense Ministry Joint Staff on the same day.Taiwan media said Sunday that there have been no similar missions by the PLA recently, and the Taiwan military was still confirming if the PLA bombers indeed returned from the same route they came, or returned after crossing the Bashi Channel.By flying through airspace to the east of Taiwan, the PLA showed it can not only strike targets in western Taiwan, but also on the eastern side of the island. From there, PLA warplanes can also conduct anti-access and area denial missions and keep foreign interventions away, a Chinese mainland military expert told the Global Times on Sunday under condition of anonymity.Prior to the Sunday operation by the H-6Ks, the PLA has sent military aircraft to Taiwan's southwestern ""airspace"" at least eight times this month. A variety of military aircraft including the J-10, J-11, and Su-30 fighter jets, and Y-8 special mission aircraft were involved, according to information released by Taiwan's defense authority.Many of these missions were believed to be countermeasures against US military aircraft approaches to or even crossing of Taiwan Island.Chinese mainland military expert and TV commentator Song Zhongping told the Global Times that the PLA operations from both the east and southwest of Taiwan indicate that the PLA is training to suppress the potential US and Japanese reinforcements coming from Guam and the Ryukyu Islands through the Miyako Strait east of Taiwan and through the Bashi, Balintang, and Babuyan channels southwest of Taiwan.The PLA could use these operations to effectively lockdown the area from foreign forces while ensuring that Taiwan's forces cannot escape, Song noted.When asked about Taiwan's close interactions with the US in the past month, Senior Colonel Wu Qian, a Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson, said at a regular press conference on Wednesday that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and Taiwan affairs are purely China's internal affairs that brook no external interference.The PLA has been on high alert, and has the firm resolve, full confidence and sufficient capabilities to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, Wu said.

Photo:China Military For the eighth time in June, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) reportedly sent military aircraft to Taiwan's southwestern ""airspace"" on Friday. Chinese mainland military experts said the regular exercises are beginning to show strategic significance, as they are not only aimed at intercepting US military aircraft flying through the area or sending messages to Taiwan secessionists, but also serve as practical trainings, with the aim of gathering military information from Taiwan, and suppressing potential US and Japanese reinforcements coming from the Miyako Strait and Bashi Channel.The PLA military aircraft were spotted entering Taiwan island's southwestern ""airspace"" on Friday, Taiwan media reported on the same day, citing a statement by a spokesperson of the island's defense authority. It did not specify the type of PLA aircraft.Taiwan's media outlets also noted that shortly before the PLA's excursion, the US military sent an EP-3E signals reconnaissance aircraft to the same area, which made its way through the Bashi Channel, before heading toward the South China Sea ""in search of PLA submarines.""Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Friday that the PLA aircraft likely took its specific route to track and intercept the US warplane.Since the start of June, the PLA had conducted eight similar excursions, using a variety of aircraft including the J-10, J-11, and Su-30 fighter jets, and Y-8 special mission aircraft, according to information released by Taiwan's defense authority.In many of these operations, US military aircraft were also spotted near the island of Taiwan, and military analysts added the PLA has routinized these types of operations to intercept US aircraft and increased the PLA's presence in the area.The PLA has previously sent J-11 fighter jets, KJ-500 early warning aircraft, and H-6 bombers to air zones east of Taiwan island.The operations could mean that the PLA is training to suppress the potential US and Japanese reinforcements coming from Guam and Ryukyu Islands through the Miyako Strait east of Taiwan and through the Bashi, Balintang, and Babuyan channels southwest of Taiwan, Song said, adding that the PLA could use these operations to effectively lockdown the area from foreign forces while ensuring that Taiwan's forces cannot escape.Taiwan has naval and air force bases in its southwest, and with the island's annual Han Kuang exercise quickly approaching, Song said the PLA aircraft could continue these exercises for reconnaissance purposes, and to monitor Taiwan military's movements and gather intelligence on its weapons.

"Virus found in Beijing close to European strains: WHOnWHO File photo:AFP The WHO confirmed on Friday that the virus sequences from the new outbreak in Beijing is closely related to the European strain, saying the virus was very likely imported to Beijing from strains circulating in Europe.At a press briefing on Friday, WHO’s emergencies director, Dr. Michael Ryan said the evidence shows that the Beijing outbreak appears to be human-to-human transmission, not another cross-species infection.Chinese experts said the virus could have been contaminated during packaging or transporting imported frozen food products to the Beijing wholesale market where it was recently detected.“In regard to the route of virus transmission into Beijing from Europe, if confirmed, it is likely the virus remained in imported frozen food where it lurked in dark and humid environment, and then exposed to local visitors to the market,” Yang Zhanqiu, deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told the Global Times on Saturday.Other possibilities include infected people, who had been from or been to Europe, visited the Xinfadi market and caused human-to-human transmission, said Yang.Chinese health officials said on Friday that it was highly likely the strain of virus is the same as the European virus, but “is older than the virus currently spreading in Europe.""Yang said it’s possible the virus was transported to China from the current outbreak in Europe, but genetic mutations occurred as it adapted to the Chinese environment and new hosts.Further laboratory tests and genome sequencing are required to learn more about origin of the virus strains, Yang said.Leading virologist, Jin Dongyan, who is a professor at the School of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Hong Kong, compared the data of three genome sequences of the virus released by Chinese researchers and found that the genetic differences were very small.""That means they likely came from the same place. Worldwide data shows the virus variants that are most genetically similar were found in the Czech Republic, the island of Taiwan and some areas in Europe,"" Jin told the Global Times on Saturday.Ryan noted that “strains and viruses have moved around the world” throughout the pandemic. He said that many viruses in New York “were of European origin” and ""Japan has imported cases from Europe,"" but this doesn't mean that Europe was necessarily the source of the recent Beijing outbreak.""What it's saying most likely is that the disease was probably imported from outside Beijing at some point,"" Ryan said, adding that ""establishing when that happened and how long the chain of transmission is important.""Ryan called for a detailed investigation into the recent coronavirus outbreak in Beijing, where 205 cases have been reported between June 11 and Saturday.National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention under the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention is taking the lead in establishing a nationwide virus monitoring and tracing system based on the entire viral genome, so as to deal with the current problems surrounding the traceability of the virus, Chinese health official said on Friday.It only took about a week for China to publish its result of the virus genome sequences analysis in new outbreak in Beijing, much faster than that of the earlier outbreak in Wuhan which took 16 days, as it is a matter deeply related to national security and international reputation, said Yang, adding it also reflects on how China is taking responsibility for health security of global public.The WHO's judgement on the virus strain is basically consistent with that of Chinese scientists, which indicates that the WHO accepts the Chinese conclusion on the sequence analysis of the virus’ genome.Ryan praised the intense and efficient investigations going on in Beijing. But he stressed it was essential to understand how the virus spread so quickly and what environments in the market – included crowded working conditions, air conditioning and the presence of water – allows the disease to spread.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Friday that the pandemic is ""accelerating,"" as more than 150,000 cases were reported to the WHO on Thursday, the highest single-day number so far reported.Tedros warned countries not to relax their infection control measures too soon as ""we are in a new and dangerous phase.""

Instead, Beijingers are exploring ways to try to keep their lives undisturbed while carefully co-existing with the virus.Zhang Qiang, an official of Beijing's COVID-19 prevention team, said at a Wednesday press conference that six groups should be rounded up for testing, including medical workers, public service sector employees and teachers and students who have already returned to school, community-based frontline workers, alongside workers at the Xinfadi food wholesale market and other related markets as well as residents living in nearby communities.Beijing is able to conduct nucleic tests for 400,000 people on a daily basis, said Zhang, noting that the city will further expand its nucleic acid testing capacity to meet the increasing demand.A total of 98 hospitals, disease control departments and third-party institutions will work to ensure orderly and effective testing for residents.Xu Hejian, a spokesperson for the Beijing municipal government, said on Wednesday that comprehensive screening, nucleic acid testing and home observations should be carried out on those who have had close contact or association with the Xinfadi wholesale market, where the latest COVID-19 outbreak was discovered last week.Beijing has disinfected 276 farm produce markets and closed 11 underground and semi-underground markets as of Tuesday morning, and 33,173 catering service providers have also been disinfected. The capital city was expected to complete its citywide sanitation of markets and restaurants by Tuesday midnight.The Global Times reporter learned that food markets and restaurants in Beijing have been racing against time to disinfect, and most of them completed the task on Tuesday. Meanwhile, they were required to complete nucleic acid testing of their staff on Wednesday. If they cannot, they must do so before Thursday.On the first day that Beijing returned to the Level II emergency response, Li Sai got up very early and took her daughter to the nearby community hospital for a nucleic acid test. Under level II, those who must leave Beijing must obtain a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test certificate no longer than seven days prior to departure.To reunite with her husband in Qinhuangdao, two hours from Beijing by high-speed train, Li told the Global Times on Wednesday that she must leave the city quickly before the district where she resides is classified as a medium or high-risk region for the COVID-19. Communities in high risk sub-districts are under lockdown management. No one is allowed to leave.In subways, shopping mall and restaurants, inspectors were assigned to warn customers to keep a safe distance from each other, and remind them to wear protective gear to prevent infection.Under Level II, Beijing reinstated closed managements on communities, required people to have their temperatures taken, register with the entrance guards, and check health codes before entering the closed communities. Communities, sub-districts, streets in high/medium-risk areas would ban outsiders and cars from entering; and communities of high-risk sub-districts would have closed-off management, allowing no one to leave.Mei An, who works at a bank in Beijing, told the Global Times that she supports such targeted control measures. ""It seems that we have to co-exist with the virus for a long time. We cannot just impose strict citywide lockdown measures every time an outbreak is reported. The price is too heavy.""Although it did not go as far as Wuhan, some netizens have called Beijing's strict measures a ""semi-lockdown.""A Beijing resident surnamed Fan, who stayed in Wuhan since January and returned to the capital in April, told the Global Times that there's a noticeable different between Beijing's level II response to Wuhan's lockdown.""Compared to the initial chaos in Wuhan, which was generated by ignorance of the virus, Beijing's virus battle is more orderly. It only targets high-risk areas, and swiftly and effectively screens people related to those places,"" Fan said, noting that he is confident in Beijing's capability to bring the outbreak under control in a short time.Some foreign media, such as Financial Times, reported that China did not impose a full lockdown out of political concerns.Wang Guangfa, a respiratory expert at Peking University First Hospital, dismissed such a suggestion, saying Beijing's response measures are in line with the city's situation. ""China sealed off Wuhan because we had little understanding of the virus back then. The fact that there were other infection cases found outside Huanan wet market, where the outbreak was first reported, suggests that there was sustained community transmission in the early stages.""""But Beijing is different, as all infections are connected to Xinfadi market, which means it is still a confined outbreak,"" said Wang.Wang said that the next few days are important. ""Beijing's virus prevention effectiveness will surface 14 days after the measures were taken… if there are no infections for two incubation periods (28 days), the prevention measures are likely to be loosened.""

"Update: PLA warplanes conduct consecutive missions near TaiwannA J-10 fighter jet attached to an aviation brigade of the air force under the PLA Southern Theater Command takes off from the runway for a flight training task on May 20, 2020. Photo:China Military Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) warplanes have approached Taiwan island at least four times in just nine days, with the latest being aircraft including J-10 fighter jets and Y-8 aircraft again entering the island's southwestern ""airspace,"" media reported Wednesday. This shows that this kind of operation by the PLA has become normalized and will put huge pressure on secessionists, analysts said.PLA warplanes including J-10 fighter jets and Y-8 aircraft were spotted entering Taiwan island's southwestern ""airspace"" on Wednesday noon, Taiwan media reported on Wednesday, citing the island's defense authorities.This latest PLA operation came only a day after a PLA J-10 fighter jet was spotted briefly entering Taiwan island's southwestern ""airspace"" on Tuesday morning, Taiwan media reported on Wednesday.Similar PLA sorties were observed four times in nine days: on Friday a Y-8 aircraft and on June 9 a group of Su-30 fighter jets were seen. They all entered Taiwan's ""air defense identification zone,"" Taiwan media claimed.The frequent sorties by PLA warplanes in the direction of Taiwan are an indication that the Chinese mainland military has normalized and made such operations routine at a time when Taiwan secessionists are increasingly seeking ""independence"" and foreign forces such as the US are intervening with aircraft and warplane transits as well as arms sales, a Beijing-based military expert who asked not to be named told the Global Times on Wednesday.Normalized sorties will let the Taiwan secessionists understand the power gap between the Chinese mainland and the island, as they will find themselves struggling to deal with frequent PLA operations, and the US cannot come to their rescue, the expert said.The Tuesday operation is also the first time the J-10 aircraft has edged near Taiwan, the reports said.Previously, PLA warplanes including J-11 fighter jets, KJ-500 early warning aircraft and H-6K bombers have participated in similar operations.The PLA is conducting real combat-oriented training, and in a real combat, all types of warplanes will participate as an integrated system. The J-10 is the mainland's equivalent to Taiwan's F-16, so it is very natural it will play a part, the expert said.Each time Taiwan defense authorities report PLA aircraft sorties, they claimed they ""expelled"" the aircraft via broadcast communications.""Can a dog make a train leave by barking? Trains only drive away on their own,"" Chinese mainland netizens said. "	6/17/20	0	0	0.8399	1
"Returnees from mainland, Macao, Taiwan to HK exempted from 14-day quarantinenA worker in protective suit collects a swab from a teacher for nucleic acid test in Fancheng District of Xiangyang City, central China's Hubei Province, April 18, 2020. (Photo by Xie Jianfei/Xinhua) Nearly 10,000 people returning from Chinese mainland, Taiwan Island and Macao to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) had been exempted from the compulsory 14-day self-isolation as of Friday, as Hong Kong eased quarantine rules, data showed.The Hong Kong Trade and Industry Department granted approvals to 8,800 persons working in the mainland factories that make products for Hong Kong residents' daily needs.The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau said it had received 150 applications from Hong Kong-listed companies' executives between May 22 and June 11 and approved 130 of them, without revealing the number of people exempted from quarantine.The HKSAR government announced on April 28 that people who enter Hong Kong to study or for business activity in the interests of Hong Kong's economic development would be exempted from the 14-day home quarantines.The city further eased cross-border travel restrictions on June 8 by allowing executives of Hong Kong-listed companies to apply for exemptions from the compulsory quarantine rules upon arrival from the mainland.According to a South China Morning Post report, there are 480 eligible companies, including Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent Holdings, insurer AIA and HSBC.However, a 30-something white-collar worker surnamed Sun in Hong Kong told the Global Times that common people working in Hong Kong but living in bordering Shenzhen, South China's Guangdong Province, should get more privileges in terms of quarantine relaxation.""Many of my colleagues now live in Shenzhen after the violence in Hong Kong last year, and because of 14-day quarantine rules on both sides, they have no choice but to live in hotels in Hong Kong,"" Sun said.She said that she hopes the Hong Kong government could release a health code soon and arrange for mutual recognition with the mainland so as to provide quarantine exemptions for those have to commute between Hong Kong and neighboring Shenzhen city for work or study.Liu Guohong, director of the Shenzhen-based Department of Finance and Modern Industries at the China Development Institute, called for mutual recognition of quarantine rules between Hong Kong and the mainland to promote capital and people flows in the region and the integration of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.This mechanism should not be too long-lived, as the HKSAR government said in a June 8 announcement that it's discussing with authorities in the mainland the mutual recognition of COVID-19 testing results, with a view to ending the quarantine requirement for Hong Kong travelers to the mainland.

(eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Li Hengjiang) The island of Taiwan's defense authority said fighter jets of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) approached the island on Tuesday, the day a US military aircraft flew over the island that's bound to further raise cross-Straits tensions following a series of US arms sales to the island, and a US warship transit through the Taiwan Straits.The US warplane's rare flight over Taiwan showed the increasing collaboration between the US military and Taiwan secessionists, and the Chinese mainland's fighter jet sorties and approaches sent them a powerful warning and demonstrated how much the PLA was determined and prepared for war, Chinese mainland experts said on Tuesday.A US C-40 military transport aircraft was identified flying over the west coastline of Taiwan on Tuesday morning, Taiwan media reported, citing the island's defense authority.Taiwan's defense authority later on Tuesday said the US aircraft's flight over the island ""was approved and it did not land,"" Taiwan media reported.Around the same time on Tuesday morning, multiple PLA Su-30 fighter jets on Tuesday morning briefly entered the southwestern ""airspace"" of Taiwan island, according to a separate report by Taiwan media, also citing the island's defense authority.Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the PLA's fighter jet sorties and approaches to Taiwan is likely a counter to the provocative move by the US military aircraft.The US C-40's flight was approved by Taiwan's defense authority, and this was a straight-up provocation hatched by the Taiwan and US militaries, signifying the increasing military cooperation between them, Song said, noting that this can also be seen as a de facto joint military drill, indicating the US could lend Taiwan support in a war and give Taiwan secessionists courage to fight the mainland.Beijing-based military expert Wei Dongxu told the Global Times on Tuesday that the deployment of the Su-30 fighter jets amid the US operation showed the PLA is always on high combat alert, and it can react very fast when intruders approach Taiwan.The PLA is capable of covering the entire Taiwan and nearby airspace, and weave dense defense positions, and US aircraft could be identified and locked on by PLA fighter jets, Wei said.Wei noted that the Su-30 is fighter jet with long endurance, advanced radar systems and can carry medium-range air-to-air missile that can shoot down targets from afar. Sending the Su-30s also showed the PLA's capability to seize air superiority.

Soon after, Taiwan's defense authority said it is procuring land-based Harpoon missiles from the US.US Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer USS Russell on Thursday made a transit through the Taiwan Straits in the seventh such passage in 2020, Taiwan media reported.Song said that the latest PLA Su-30 sorties were also required by the demands of enhancing war preparedness in a potential military conflict in the Taiwan Straits as tensions rise.PLA aircraft usually exercise restraints when conducting missions related to Taiwan, like flying on the Chinese mainland side of the ""middle line"" of the Straits. But this time, they flew to the southwestern ""airspace"" of the island, which showed the determination and capability of the PLA, and this will become more frequent and routine, Song said.Prior to the Su-30 sorties, the PLA also frequently sent warplanes , including H-6 bombers, KJ-500 early warning aircraft and J-11 fighter jets near Taiwan this year in missions, with some also featured warships.The PLA recently has also been holding intensive landing and naval drills including some featuring amphibious tanks storming the beaches and civilian ships transporting tanks and armored vehicles across the sea, which experts say sends a warning to Taiwan secessionists.Wu Qian, a spokesperson for the PLA and People's Armed Police Force delegation to the 3rd session of the 13th National People's Congress (NPC), told media on the sidelines of the NPC session in May that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and that the Taiwan question is China's internal affair, and China will not accept any foreign interference.China will not allow anyone, any organization or political party to separate any part of Chinese territory from the nation at any time, in any way. The PLA has the firm will, full confidence and enough capability to thwart any kind of secessionist attempt by foreign forces, and will take any necessary measures to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, Wu said.

"Taiwan DPP won’t rescue all separatists in Hong KongnThe Chinese national flag and the flag of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region fly above the Golden Bauhinia Square in Hong Kong, China, Aug 5, 2019. Photo:Xinhua Taiwan's separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority has delayed announcing its plan to receive and resettle Hong Kong separatists and illegal activists who plan to escape to Taiwan due to new national security legislation for Hong Kong.Experts from the Chinese mainland noted that the DPP authority won't sincerely help these lawbreakers as they can only be useful if they stay in Hong Kong and interrupt the ""one country, two systems"" principle.If they tried to escape, they would be useless and an encumbrance to Taiwan. Most of them have neither money nor talent, so most of them will surely be abandoned.On May 28, the regional leader of the island, Tsai Ing-wen, vowed to ""proactively rescue"" those who could be punished by the new national security law due their illegal activates in Hong Kong. The plan was handed to the executive branch of the authority, and the mainland affairs council of Taiwan said that the plan would be announced within a week. So far, however, nothing has been announced.According to the Taiwan-based chinatimes.com, Chiu Chui-cheng, a deputy head of the mainland affairs council of Taiwan, told the media that due to ""the fast-changing situation in Hong Kong,"" and ""legislative progress of the national security law for Hong Kong,"" as well as international reactions, the plan needed to be precisely adjusted.The Taiwan People's Party, an extreme separatist political party of the island, has criticized and questioned the DPP authority for the delay, accusing it of ""talking too much and doing nothing"" as these extremists want to use this ""rescue plan"" as a chance to show the West that the island is making efforts to shelter its allies who also support separatism in Hong Kong.Li Xiaobing, a Taiwan affairs expert at Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times on Sunday that it is very normal for the DPP to be reluctant on this issue as it is facing a dilemma - most people on the island don't welcome these lawbreakers, who have no money or talent, but who only know about throwing gas bombs and hurting innocent people.But if Taiwan abandons these Hong Kong separatists, the DPP's hypocrisy in supporting the so-called freedom and human rights of Hong Kong last year during the regional election would be uncovered.No matter what Taiwan does to shelter these law breakers, they and the Taiwan separatists will be punished eventually, experts noted.The only difference is that the island's tax payers will have to spend more money to feed these useless lawbreakers and separatists from Hong Kong, and this won't have any effect on the mainland or the national security legislation, said a Beijing-based Taiwan and Hong Kong affairs expert who asked not to be identified.""The more garbage that Taiwan rescues, the fewer prisons we need to jail these criminals [from Hong Kong],"" he said.A few leaders of the Hong Kong separatists might benefit from Taiwan's unannounced plan as they can be puppets of the DPP, making noise to stigmatize the Chinese mainland in Taiwan.This would be their only remaining value as long as they could escape successfully, but most illegal activists will not have such a chance to run away, Li noted.

The US destroyer USS Rafael Peralta was also spotted to the north of Taiwan in the past few days.Chinese mainland experts noted that the Taiwan missiles are not technologically advanced and cannot change the overwhelming advantage the PLA has over the island.On Tuesday, a US C-40 military transport aircraft made a flyover along the west coastline of Taiwan, and a group of Su-30 fighter jets of the PLA briefly entered the southwestern ""airspace"" of Taiwan island at the same time, a move widely interpreted as a counter by the Chinese mainland to provocative US action.All necessary measures will be taken to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, said Hua Chunying , a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, at a regular press conference on Thursday.

Analysts said China's retaliation should precisely hit politicians who provoke China's sovereignty and avoid harming innocent Czech companies in China.According to the Associated Press (AP), Milos Vystrcil said he would be accompanied by a business delegation on his visit, which is tentatively scheduled to begin on August 30. Vystrcil said he was also planning to meet Taiwan's regional leaders, but didn't immediately give details.Vystrcil's predecessor in the post, Jaroslav Kubera, was planning to travel to Taiwan before he died in January. His plans angered Czech President Milos Zeman who respects the one-China principle and paid efforts to build friendly ties with China.The DPP authorities have spent a lot of resources on making trouble regarding China-Czech ties and divide the relationship between the Czech Republic government and the Senate in recent years citing different excuses. The separatist authorities expressed their ""welcome"" to the plan made by Vystrcil, and said that the trip ""will advance cooperation and interactions between Taiwan and the Czech Republic in economic, technological, medical, tourism, and cultural areas.""The Chinese mainland has actually allowed economies and countries around the globe to have non-official ties which include normal trade and cultural exchanges before the realization of reunification, but the mainland firmly opposes any country building formal diplomatic ties and even military cooperation with the island, as these moves will harm China's sovereignty and are against the one-China principle that is respected by most countries around the globe and the UN.Therefore a visit conducted by the speaker of the senate to the island is truly provoking China's bottom-line regarding sovereignty matters, and if Vystrcil just wants to boost trade and cultural exchanges with the island, it is totally unnecessary for him to have such a plan to provoke the mainland, said Chinese analysts.""The People's Republic of China believes it has a right to tell us what to do,"" Vystrcil said. He said the Czech Republic will benefit from his trip to the island, according to the AP.A Beijing-based expert on Taiwan affairs who requested anonymity said that Taiwan is definitely China's domestic affairs, and Czech politicians like Vystrcil are rudely imposing interference over China's internal affairs, but they still dare to accuse China of interference in the Czech Republic's ""internal affairs"" while Beijing expressed reasonable opposition and anger over their acts to support separatism in Taiwan.This is truly ""gangster logic"" and China will surely retaliate against Vystrcil's moves as there is no room for China to tolerate provocations regarding its sovereignty, he noted.The AP reported that the government of the Czech Republic also suggested Vystrcil not take the trip.However, due to the government and the senate of the country displaying a different attitude on the matter, some Chinese analysts said that China's retaliation could precisely hit the politicians who provoke China's sovereignty and avoid harming the Czech companies in China if they do nothing wrong.

"PLA Su-30 fighter jets edge near Taiwan as US military aircraft flies through the islandnPilots assigned to a naval aviation brigade under the PLA Eastern Theater Command keep their Su-30 fighter jet in a specified airspace while awaiting further clearance during an actual-combat flight training exercise in mid-February, 2020. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Li Hengjiang) The island of Taiwan's defense authority said fighter jets of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) approached the island on Tuesday, the day a US military aircraft flew over the island that's bound to further raise cross-Straits tensions following a series of US arms sales to the island, and a US warship transit through the Taiwan Straits.The US warplane's rare flight over Taiwan showed the increasing collaboration between the US military and Taiwan secessionists, and the Chinese mainland's fighter jet sorties and approaches sent them a powerful warning and demonstrated how much the PLA was determined and prepared for war, Chinese mainland experts said on Tuesday.A US C-40 military transport aircraft was identified flying over the west coastline of Taiwan on Tuesday morning, Taiwan media reported, citing the island's defense authority.Taiwan's defense authority later on Tuesday said the US aircraft's flight over the island ""was approved and it did not land,"" Taiwan media reported.Around the same time on Tuesday morning, multiple PLA Su-30 fighter jets on Tuesday morning briefly entered the southwestern ""airspace"" of Taiwan island, according to a separate report by Taiwan media, also citing the island's defense authority.Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the PLA's fighter jet sorties and approaches to Taiwan is likely a counter to the provocative move by the US military aircraft.The US C-40's flight was approved by Taiwan's defense authority, and this was a straight-up provocation hatched by the Taiwan and US militaries, signifying the increasing military cooperation between them, Song said, noting that this can also be seen as a de facto joint military drill, indicating the US could lend Taiwan support in a war and give Taiwan secessionists courage to fight the mainland.Beijing-based military expert Wei Dongxu told the Global Times on Tuesday that the deployment of the Su-30 fighter jets amid the US operation showed the PLA is always on high combat alert, and it can react very fast when intruders approach Taiwan.The PLA is capable of covering the entire Taiwan and nearby airspace, and weave dense defense positions, and US aircraft could be identified and locked on by PLA fighter jets, Wei said.Wei noted that the Su-30 is fighter jet with long endurance, advanced radar systems and can carry medium-range air-to-air missile that can shoot down targets from afar. Sending the Su-30s also showed the PLA's capability to seize air superiority.

Soon after, Taiwan's defense authority said it is procuring land-based Harpoon missiles from the US.US Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer USS Russell on Thursday made a transit through the Taiwan Straits in the seventh such passage in 2020, Taiwan media reported.Song said that the latest PLA Su-30 sorties were also required by the demands of enhancing war preparedness in a potential military conflict in the Taiwan Straits as tensions rise.PLA aircraft usually exercise restraints when conducting missions related to Taiwan, like flying on the Chinese mainland side of the ""middle line"" of the Straits. But this time, they flew to the southwestern ""airspace"" of the island, which showed the determination and capability of the PLA, and this will become more frequent and routine, Song said.Prior to the Su-30 sorties, the PLA also frequently sent warplanes , including H-6 bombers, KJ-500 early warning aircraft and J-11 fighter jets near Taiwan this year in missions, with some also featured warships.The PLA recently has also been holding intensive landing and naval drills including some featuring amphibious tanks storming the beaches and civilian ships transporting tanks and armored vehicles across the sea, which experts say sends a warning to Taiwan secessionists.Wu Qian, a spokesperson for the PLA and People's Armed Police Force delegation to the 3rd session of the 13th National People's Congress (NPC), told media on the sidelines of the NPC session in May that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and that the Taiwan question is China's internal affair, and China will not accept any foreign interference.China will not allow anyone, any organization or political party to separate any part of Chinese territory from the nation at any time, in any way. The PLA has the firm will, full confidence and enough capability to thwart any kind of secessionist attempt by foreign forces, and will take any necessary measures to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, Wu said.

"US warship crosses Taiwan Straits attempting to shift its domestic pressure: analystnThe aircraft carrier Liaoning formation returns to a military port. Photo: cnsphoto A US warship made a transit through the Taiwan Straits on Thursday, the seventh of such an event in 2020. The move is not only preparing the US military for a potential conflict in the region and an attempt to provoke the Chinese mainland, but also an attempt to shift domestic pressure from widespread protests, COVID-19 and a poor economy, for which the Chinese mainland should maintain its strategic focus and not dance to the US' tune, analysts said on Friday.The USS Russell transited the Taiwan Straits on Thursday ""in support of security and stability in the Indo-Pacific"" region, the US 7th Fleet said on Friday on its Facebook account.This is the seventh time a US warship has sailed through the Taiwan Straits this year, Taiwan media reported.The USS Russell is an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer with a displacement of around 8,000 tons. With a length of about 154 meters, it is equipped with anti-air, anti-ship and land-attack missiles and torpedoes. This class of destroyer is one of the main battle surface vessels of the US Navy and has frequently passed the Taiwan Straits.US warships' transits through the Taiwan Straits provides an opportunity for the US Navy to gather related military intelligence including hydrologic information, allowing the US to become familiarized with the sea area and gain initiatives in a potential military conflict, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Friday.Such an operation is also sending the wrong signal to Taiwan secessionists and letting them think the US military is backing them up, which is also a provocation to the Chinese mainland, Song said.The latest US destroyer transit came at a time when the US is facing huge domestic pressures including widespread protests that were triggered by the death of African American George Floyd, the world's most COVID-19 infections and deaths and a depressed economy.US President Donald Trump is attempting to shift these domestic pressures by instigating a provocation with China, which is likely to become an election issue, Song said, adding that China should maintain its strategic focus and not dance to the US' tune.The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has the firm will and full capability of resolving the Taiwan question if it comes to that, and this cannot be changed by some US warships' transit through the Taiwan Straits because the PLA had an overwhelming advantage in the region, analysts said.Frequent and intensive amphibious landing and naval drills are continuously being held by the PLA, including amphibious tanks storming the beaches, civilian ships transporting tanks and armored vehicles across the sea and training missions by the aircraft carrier Shandong and other advanced warships, recent reports show.

"US unable to manipulate cross-Straits situationnPhoto: GT RELATED ARTICLES: Taiwan authorities harbor terrorists by calling for refuge to HK rioters Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen delivered her so-called inaugural speech on May 20 to commence her second term. How will Washington's increasing support to the island affect the Taiwan Straits situation? Will a military clash break out between the world's two largest economies over the island? The Global Times () reporter Lu Yuanzhi invited Douglas Paal (), Distinguished Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace of the US, and Jin Canrong (), the associate dean of Renmin University of China's School of International Studies in Beijing, to share their insights on these issues.Even before the Trump administration came to power, there has been a dual faceted policy toward the island of Taiwan from him. Many in his government want to elevate US relations with Taiwan in every way possible. Some want to use Taiwan as a cudgel against the Chinese mainland and its influence. Strangely, Trump himself seems not to share this view. He seems to view Taiwan as a ""small country,"" small market, and maybe even tradable in negotiating business deals. This duality seems to have kept lower level officials from crossing really sensitive redlines in the long established ambiguities prevailing in US-Taiwan-Chinese mainland relations. I don't think all current American officials appreciate how sensitive and explosive this issue is. In fact, I believe some think it will help bring the Chinese government down. So the situation devolving into a major crisis has low probability, but potentially high consequences.This is unclear beyond noting that some in the administration believe having Taiwan on its side is an asset in containing the mainland.The US has no interest in having a war in the Taiwan Straits. That has been true since 1950, and every administration since then has tried to finesse the relevant issues. But the US interest and Trump's calculations are two different things. For example, in the middle of a global pandemic, the US has no interest in losing a role within the WHO, but Trump is trying to withdraw from it.Close, but we are not there yet. I trust the Taiwan authorities are too smart to get dragged into something that will change the status quo at the expense of Taiwan's autonomy and quality of life.Again, I don't know. The past week, after the National People's Congress, has seen wild things said, but cautious things being done, or incautious things not done. The gap between rhetoric and action is wide.Taiwan, in my view, should stick to advocating its own interests, including international participation and acknowledgement, autonomy at home, lessons in good governance, especially concerning epidemics, and sound economics. None of those is compatible with becoming a spear-head for America's brooding conflict with China. If US officials want to send videos to Taiwan ceremonies, why would Taiwan want to reject them? If the US wants to send the 7th fleet into Taiwan's waters, in the absence of a Chinese mainland attack, Taiwan should ask why and to what purpose?The language used in Tsai's inaugural address on May 20 signaled to me very clearly that she is maintaining the basic official line of status quo, despite its many uncomfortable aspects.The rise of China depends on our own economic development. As long as we stay on track, no outside force can stop us from growing stronger. It is just a matter of time before China surpasses the US in terms of comprehensive national strength. From this perspective, no matter what card the US plays, it cannot change the general trend of China. So, practically speaking, the Taiwan card is useless.The island of Taiwan has been used by Washington as a chess piece to contain China's development. The US used to have a bottom line, but now it is becoming increasingly radical due to fears of a rising China. Washington is not as confident as it was. It once believed that it would undoubtedly win the game with China. But now it has become scared and is using all the tools at its disposal to contain China. As US elites' hostility toward China deepens, they might possibly cross China's bottom line. Given Tsai's intention to change the status quo, the cross-Straits situation could become increasingly risky.The US has threatened China with the Taiwan question. Although Washington has signaled to strengthen ""diplomatic"" relations with the island, the US won't really do that. But the US Congress has passed various acts related to Taiwan, many articles of which violate the one-China principle. Normally, the US won't go that far, but given irrational and the reckless moves of Trump and his administration, the possibility of the US crossing the redline is increasing. Therefore, the Chinese central government must be prepared for escalated confrontations.The Chinese mainland wishes to see a peaceful reunification with the island. And we always prefer stable relations with the US. But if Washington and the island of Taiwan cross the line and push the mainland into a corner, we will launch counterattacks. We have plenty of measures to do so, including a military solution to the Taiwan question. We can see in this year's government work report that reunification rather peaceful reunification is emphasized. This to some extent shows the mainland's will to settle the Taiwan question, even it has to use military force.From Tsai's speech on May 20, we can see that she has kept a low profile but a tough stance. She intends to promote amending relevant local laws to realize secession. This is a very dangerous move, reflecting her attempts to change the status quo. Besides, Tsai mentioned enhancing military power. This further tilt toward the US will widen the distance with the Chinese central government. In a low profile way, she is actually pushing for secession of the island. This could endanger cross-Straits relations in the following four years.It depends on whether Washington and the island's authorities cross the bottom line. Actually, the Chinese central government can launch attacks whenever it wants and the result will be in favor of the mainland. Within the first island chain, the Chinese mainland faces no rivals.

"PLA holds intensive landing, naval drills in ‘warning to secessionists’nMarines assigned to a brigade of the PLA Navy Marine Corps move forward for assault after disembarking from their amphibious armored vehicle during a beach raid training exercise in the west of south China's Guangdong Province on August 17, 2019. (Photo: eng.chinamil.com.cn) The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been holding frequent and intensive amphibious landing and naval drills in what analysts said are sending warnings to Taiwan secessionists.Some of the recent exercises featured amphibious tanks storming the beaches and civilian ships transporting tanks and armored vehicles across the sea. Ongoing drills may feature China's second aircraft carrier the Shandong, as well as other advanced warships, or even the test firing of new weapons like the JL-3 submarine-launched ballistic missile or the electromagnetic railgun.The PLA 73rd Group Army recently conducted a live-fire assessment in a location on the southeastern coast, in which 68 amphibious tanks stormed the beaches from the sea in a coordinated attack under a rough sea situation, as the tanks launched concentrated main gun shooting and released smoke to camouflage the assault, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Wednesday.In another training operation, the PLA 74th Group Army used a large civilian cargo ship to transport more than 50 tanks, armored vehicles and infantry fighting vehicles across the sea, according to a separate report by CCTV.The 73rd Group Army and the 74th Group Army are based in eastern and southern China, and both are believed to be the main forces which would be used in a potential landing mission on the island of Taiwan.The subjects featured in these two exercises are normal and routine, and they are basic capabilities of the PLA, a military expert who asked not to be named told the Global Times on Thursday.The PLA always stands ready to reunify Taiwan and safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and Taiwan secessionists should not underestimate this, the expert said.In addition to these amphibious exercises, the PLA is conducting naval drills in the Bohai Sea, according to the Maritime Safety Administration.A military mission is ongoing from Tuesday to June 16, and a live-fire drill will be held from Friday to Wednesday, both in the Bohai Sea, read two navigation notices released by the administration this week.While neither notice gives any detail on the two drills, military observers noted that at least one likely features China's second aircraft carrier, the Shandong. It has started military missions since May 25 to test its weapons and equipment and improve the level of aircraft carrier training to enhance the troops' ability to perform missions and tasks, said Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang, spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense , at a regular press conference on May 29.When the Shandong set out on May 25, a Maritime Safety Administration notice restricted access to an area in the Yellow Sea from May 25 to Tuesday. This time period connects to the Tuesday-to-June 16 restriction notice, meaning the Shandong might be now training in the Bohai Sea, as the carrier has not been seen back in shipyard, observers noted.Few information is available for the other drills, as military analysts said they could be regular exercises featuring China's advanced warships that focus on tactical and technical training. Some have even speculated that they may involve test firings of new weapons like the JL-3 submarine-launched ballistic missile or the electromagnetic railgun.Near the Bohai Bay, the PLA is also conducting a live-fire drill in the northeastern sea areas off Tangshan, North China's Hebei Province, from mid-May to the end of July.These exercises show the PLA has entered an intense training season with the aim of boosting combat capability, the anonymous expert said, noting that if COVID-19 brought any delays to the training schedule, they are likely being caught up.

"Taiwan economy stays in sluggishnessnA citizen runs in front of the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan, on Oct. 1, 2019. (Xinhua/Chen Bin) Taiwan's economy remained sluggish in April as indicated by the latest index gauging the business climate, which was released by the island's economic regulating department Wednesday.The composite index of monitoring indicators continued to show a ""yellow-blue light"" in April, dropping one point from March to 19 points, suggesting that the economy maintained a tendency of sinking into recession, the department said in a press release.Under Taiwan's five-color system to assess the economy, a blue light (9-16 points) indicates contraction, a yellow-blue light (17-22) means sluggishness, a green light (23-31) signals stable growth, a yellow-red light (32-37) suggests a warming economy and a red light (38-45) points to an overheated economy.The trend-adjusted leading indicator, which is composed of seven sub-indexes to predict changes in the economy, dropped by 1.94 percent to 96.07 points in April for six consecutive months, suggesting a downward trend of the economy.Under the impact of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic, poor performance in catering and retailing led to the slipping business climate in April, the statement said.The island's manufacturing sector also saw a reduction in exports due to shrinking demands in European and U.S. markets, it added.However, the department said that it expects a recovery of local consumption in the latter half of May thanks to the easing COVID-19 epidemic.According to the island's epidemic monitoring agency, the island has reported no new COVID-19 case for six days as of Wednesday, with the total number standing at 441.

"Brazilian politicians' tricks to hype Taiwan question doomed to fail: expertnFile Photo: IC Some Brazilian politicians' tricks to scapegoat China for a rapidly worsening epidemic situation in the country by hyping the Taiwan question is doomed to fail, Chinese experts said Tuesday, stressing solid China-Brazilian cooperation and relations.Respect for the one-China principle is the basic premise and cornerstone for China's relationship with other countries, Chinese analysts stressed. Brazil and China established diplomatic ties in 1974.The remarks came after Paulo Eduardo Martins, a Brazilian Congress member posted a photo of a document allegedly from the Chinese Embassy on his social media platforms on Tuesday.He claimed that the document was a letter the Chinese embassy had sent to Brazilian parliamentarians, recommending the latter not congratulate Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen for her inauguration on May 20. The letter was issued on May 13, according to the post.Recently, some Brazilian politicians have attacked and smeared China on the COVID-19 pandemic. Tsai's inauguration was just the latest issue they have tried to make use of to shift Brazilian people's attention from the rapidly worsening epidemic in the country, Wu Hongying, director of the LatAm office of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Tuesday.""But the trick is doomed to fail. Neither will it affect the solid and close China-Brazilian ties, which is not only promoted by both governments but hailed by people on both sides,"" Wu said. She noted that the Brazilian government has always respected the one-China principle.Taiwan authorities noticed the posts and interacted with Martins on social media platforms. The issue attracted some radical anti-China elements in Brazil and on the island, some of whom even started a hashtag on Twitter #VivaTaiwan, which soon started to trend.Tsai also released a post on her Twitter account late Tuesday with a hashtag #VivaBrazil.The issue came about two months after Brazilian Federal Deputy Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of President Jair Bolsonaro, groundlessly blamed China on Twitter for the spread of the novel coronavirus, following US President Donald Trump's ""Chinese virus"" tweet.Rodrigo Maia, President of the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil, apologized in a tweet for the controversial tweet mentioned above, noting that ""this attitude does not match the importance of the Brazil-China strategic partnership and our diplomatic ties.""China has remained the biggest trading partner of Brazil for years.In 2019, the value of bilateral trade between China and Brazil was $98 billion. Brazil's exports to China totaled $63 billion in the same year - 28 percent of Brazil's total yearly exports - followed by the US of $30 billion.The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Brazil had reached nearly 380,000 as of 7:30pm Tuesday, ranking it as the world's second-most affected nation following the US.Yang Wanming, Chinese Ambassador to Brazil, explained in an interview with China Central Television on May 16 that the abrupt outbreak was related to continuous population movement between Brazil and American and European countries where the virus was spreading in the early stages of the pandemic. Brazil did launch strict measures to prevent and control a domestic epidemic, Yang said.Chinese analysts pointed out that a limited healthcare system in Brazil is another reason why the Brazilian government has found it difficult to control the epidemic.Enhanced cooperation on anti-epidemic work is currently a major part of China-Brazilian cooperation, Yang said, noting that China is willing to support Brazil to overcome the epidemic.According to Yang, the Chinese embassy has been actively communicating with Brazilian authorities and has invited Chinese medical experts who had been on the frontlines in Wuhan and other places in Hubei to share China's experience in combating the epidemic with them via online conferences.Chinese companies in Brazil have also donated a large number of medical materials, including ventilators, virus testing kits, protective suits and masks, to different places in Brazil.

"Fujian's GDP surpassing Taiwan a historic breakthrough with significance for Taiwan work: NPC deputynFile photo of the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taipei, Southeast China's Taiwan. Photo: Xinhua GDP in East China's Fujian Province reached 4.23 trillion yuan ($592.9 billion) in 2019, surpassing that of the island of Taiwan for the first time, which is a ""historic breakthrough"" having ""far-reaching significance for efforts toward Taiwan,"" said Zhang Zhijun, president of The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, and also a deputy to the National People's Congress this year.Taiwan's GDP in 2019 is 4.22 trillion yuan, with a growth rate of 2.73 percent year-on-year, while GDP of Fujian Province in 2019 reached 4.23 trillion yuan, with a growth rate of 7.6 percent, official data showed.The key factor that determines the direction of cross-Straits relations is the development and progress of the mainland provinces, Zhang said.Dai Shugeng, director of the International Finance Research Office at Xiamen University said that Fujian's voice and initiative will be strengthened when it comes to cross-Straits dialogue with Taiwan as a natural result of economic power.""Fujian's GDP has lagged behind that of Taiwan, thus the latter has had a lofty attitude when the two sides had discussions. Now, Fujian's economy is overtaking Taiwan's, with a much higher growth rate, which represents the enhancement of its economic strength. And the economic base of a society influences the superstructure of that society,"" Dai told the Global Times on Tuesday.Taiwan's GDP ranked sixth among provinces in China in 2017. By 2018, GDP of Southwest China's Sichuan Province and Central China's Hubei Province both exceeded Taiwan. In 2019, Taiwan fell one more place and ranked ninth, according to a report from domestic news site guancha.com.This year Taiwan's GDP will fall outside the top 10, said Dai, noting that Taiwan's economy has been in decline since Tsai Ing-wen became the regional leader, the pursuit of whom ""is not economic development, but personal political interests.""

"HK national security law sheds light on Taiwan question: deputiesnThe Chinese national flag and the flag of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region fly above the Golden Bauhinia Square in Hong Kong, China, Aug 5, 2019. Photo:Xinhua National People's Congress (NPC) deputies from Taiwan said Hong Kong's national security legislation sheds light on the Taiwan question, sending a warning shot to Taiwan secessionists.With the Hong Kong national security legislation as an example, the central government could further deepen, refine and even make related laws promoting reunification with the Anti-Secession Law as the basis, cracking down on ""Taiwan independence"" forces legally, said Cai Peihui, an NPC Taiwan deputy and a businessman from the island, according to a statement sent to the Global Times on Tuesday by the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots.This is a powerful warning to Tsai Ing-wen's authority that ""Taiwan independence,"" just like ""Hong Kong independence,"" is not welcomed by the Chinese people. The central government's determination in dealing with the separatists of Hong Kong and Taiwan is the same, he said.""Taiwan independence is a dead end. National security is a sharp sword hanging over Taiwan separatists' heads ,"" he said.China's Anti-Secession Law was adopted in 2005, aiming to prevent Taiwan's secession from China.The national security law would be an inspiration to peaceful reunification and the extension of ""one country, two systems"" principle, Zhang Xiong, a Taiwan deputy and a professor at Shanghai Tongji University, said, according to the statement.""The process showed that legislation should be timely. If Article 23 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong were established early, it could have awed hostile forces… Probably the fires, riots in black, 'Hong Kong independence' flags and collusion of forces would not have taken place in the city,"" Zhang said.Tsai Pei-wei said that the riots in Hong Kong last year severely damaged the prosperity and stability, as well as the economic development, of Hong Kong. The violence weakened the Hong Kong government's administrative ability and international reputation. The central government making such a national law on administrating Hong Kong is supplementary to the Basic Law of Hong Kong, which would be the legal guarantee to deal with the riots and make sure the sovereignty of Hong Kong is unchanged.Liao Haiying, an NPC Taiwan deputy and a doctor working in North China's Hebei Province, said that ""The law also would inform the two sides across the Straits that the bottom line of national security could not be crossed.""The GDP of East China's Fujian Province reached 4.23 trillion yuan ($593 billion) in 2019, with a growth rate of 7.6 percent, surpassing the Taiwan island's 4.22 trillion yuan GDP for the first time. The two regions have similar cultures and dialects. "	5/26/20	0	0	0.8055	1

"US torpedo sales to Taiwan island ‘useless’ against Chinese mainland military: expertnAmphibious armored vehicles attached to a brigade of the PLA Navy Marine Corps make their way to the beach-head during a maritime amphibious assault training in the west of south China's Guangdong Province on August 17, 2019. (Photo: eng.chinamil.com.cn) The US latest plan to sell arms to the island of Taiwan of 18 torpedoes is overpriced and cannot make any difference in a potential military conflict between the island and the Chinese mainland, and sent a wrong signal to Taiwan secessionists on the day of regional leader Tsai Ing-wen's inaugural speech, mainland military experts said on Thursday.The Chinese side is firmly opposed to the US plan to sell arms to Taiwan and has lodged stern representations with the US side, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a regular press conference on Thursday.Zhao urged the US to abide by the one-China principle, and the three China-US joint communiqués, cancel the plan of arms sale to Taiwan and end its military links with the island before it causes more harm to China-US ties and peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.Zhao and the experts' statements came after the US State Department approved the sale of 18 MK-48 Mod6 Advanced Technology Heavy Weight Torpedoes and related equipment for an estimated $180 million to the island of Taiwan, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing a Wednesday statement by the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency.It aims to serve US national, economic and security interests by supporting Taiwan's ""continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,"" the report cited the agency as saying.This type of torpedo is one of the most advanced heavyweight torpedoes in the world. It will likely be used on the Taiwan military's conventional submarines, and will attack hostile submarines or surface vessels, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times on Thursday.While the powerful US-made torpedoes could become a threat to warships of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), the Taiwan military's submarines are outdated and can easily be spotted and destroyed by the PLA, leaving them with no chance to use the torpedoes, Wei said, noting the arms sales will not make a difference to the military strength across the Straits.According to publicly available information, the cost of each MK-48 is $3.5 million. However in the latest sale, each torpedo was priced at $10 million.Even taking the cost of related equipment into account, this is a far higher price, showing that Taiwan is paying protection money to the US, and the US arms company will make a huge amount of unreasonable profit from this potential deal, analysts said.The announcement of the sale came on the same day as the inaugural speech of Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen. Tsai said in her speech that the island is seeking to bolster asymmetrical capabilities in ""national defense reforms"" to resist the will to reunite with the mainland.Wei said the announcement of the US arms sale at this time is meant to lend support to Taiwan secessionists, and the US is also hoping to have the island pin down the Chinese mainland's military capability, while bringing profits to American arms dealers.This type of torpedo is a very aggressive weapon, and the US is wrongly encouraging Taiwan to use offensive weapons and attack the PLA, Wei said.This is not the first time the US has sold MK-48 torpedoes to Taiwan. In 2017, an arms deal included 46 such torpedoes worth $250 million, reports said.In July 2019, the US approved a possible $2.2 billion arms sale to the island of Taiwan, which included 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles.The Chinese mainland reacted to this US arms sale with large-scale military drills on the southeast coast near the island of Taiwan.

"US should not underestimate Chinese people's determination for reunification: Wang YinPhoto: Wang Yi The Taiwan question is China's internal affair and the US should recognize its high sensitivity and abide by the one-China principle and three joint communiqués, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Sunday.The US should abandon its illusion and political tricks, and stop challenging China's bottom line, said Wang at a press conference on the sidelines of the annual two sessions, warning the US not to underestimate 1.4 billion Chinese people's firm determination to defend national reunification.The one-China principle is the consensus of the international community and the political basis for bilateral relations between China and other countries.Based on this principle, the Chinese government and the World Health Organization (WHO) have made arrangements for Taiwan Island's participation in global health affairs. Taiwan has smooth channels of communication for COVID-19 control information and for carrying out cooperation with the WHO and its members.""There is no technical barrier (for Taiwan to join the pandemic fight) or a problem of Taiwan being the shortfall in pandemic control,"" Wang said, noting that it was the Taiwan authorities that disregarded the benefits and well-being of its people, did not recognize the 1992 Consensus, and shut the doors to cross-Straits negotiations to deal with issues concerning foreign affairs.""We resolutely oppose official exchanges with the Taiwan authorities under the guise of pandemic prevention cooperation, resolutely oppose the pursuit of so-called international space for Taiwan in violation of the one-China principle, and resolutely oppose the external forces' connivance and encouragement of Taiwan secessionists' 'seeking Taiwan independence in the name of pandemic control,'"" Wang said.The 23 million people in Taiwan are our compatriots and we are always concerned about the epidemic situation on the island of Taiwan and the health and safety of Taiwan people. Since the outbreak, we have carefully taken care of Taiwan compatriots on the mainland, and have also assisted Taiwan compatriots living overseas. The mainland will continue to go all out for the future anti-epidemic needs of the Taiwan people, Wang said.Global Times "	5/24/20	0	0	0.2677	1
"Taiwan separatists panic as mainland drops 'peaceful' in reunification narrativenFile photo of the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan. Photo: Xinhua Taiwan separatists and foreign forces that attempt to meddle in the reunification of China are becoming panicked and nervous as the Chinese mainland changes slightly the wording regarding the approach to reunification in the Friday's government work report by omitting the word ""peaceful"" ahead of ""reunification,"" analysts said.This new narrative has sent a clear signal that the mainland will be more determined and pragmatic in diversifying its approach to realizing its obligatory goal of reunifying Taiwan, since the separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities and other political forces on the island have chosen to refuse the sincerity of a peaceful solution repeatedly encouraged by the mainland, said the experts.Premier Li Keqiang said in the government's 2020 work report that, ""We will adhere to the major principles and policies on work related to Taiwan and resolutely oppose and deter any separatist activities seeking 'Taiwan independence'"" and ""We will encourage them [fellow compatriots in Taiwan] to join us in opposing 'Taiwan independence' and promoting China's reunification.""In the 2019 report, Li said that ""We will uphold the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus, promote the peaceful growth of relations across the Taiwan Strait, and advance China's peaceful reunification.""Reuters said on Friday in a report that this change is ""an apparent policy shift that comes"" as mainland ties with Taiwan ""continue on a downward spiral."" The Wall Street Journal also said in a report on the matter that this is ""breaking with nearly three decades of precedent in a sign that it is taking a tougher tack"" toward the island.However, this adjustment doesn't mean the mainland has abandoned a peaceful approach to realize national reunification, and the mainland government and society still believe that peaceful reunification is the best, most harmless and cost-effective approach, said Li Xiaobing, a Taiwan studies expert at Nankai University in Tianjin.""But just as the firm stance that has been consistently reinforced by the mainland in past decades, a military approach has never been abandoned as this is a final solution for the worst case scenario when secessionist and foreign forces totally separate the island from China. Therefore, in nature, the mainland's policy toward Taiwan has not changed,"" Li Xiaobing told the Global Times on Saturday.The reason why Taiwan separatists and foreign forces are becoming more sensitive and even panic over the change is that they know their repeated provocations to challenge China's sovereignty and bottom line will be punished sooner or later, and they might finally learn the message behind the new narrative from the mainland as being ""one step closer to a non-peaceful solution,"" Li Xiaobing further noted.A series of provocative and harmful acts carried out by separatist DPP authorities against the mainland have seriously offended mainlanders, including backing Hong Kong rioters and separatists to create turmoil to damage the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China in 2019; exaggerating anti-China sentiment in Taiwan to serve its political goals to win the regional election; banning mask exports to the mainland while the COVID-19 outbreak ravaged Wuhan in January with the mainland facing temporary shortages of medical supplies; and ganged up with the US to use the coronavirus pandemic to stigmatize the mainland and seek separatism in front of the international community.As the mainland holds an overwhelming military advantage in the region, provocations made by the island and the US have caused rising fury among the mainland public and on social media against Taiwan separatism with mounting calls for a military solution to end the US' manipulation of using the island to contain China. A comment by a Chinese netizen posted on Sina Weibo noted that ""the military solution should not be considered as a last choice for the worst scenario, but a considerable option to end the mess once the opportunity comes.""According to foreign media reports, some Taiwan politicians also noticed China's 2020 government work report not mentioning ""the 1992 Consensus,"" and they thought that the mainland is trying to ""avoid provoking Taiwan"" as the separatist authorities refuse to accept this consensus.Li Fei, a professor at the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University in East China's Fujian Province, told the Global Times on Saturday that ""the 1992 Consensus,"" with respects to the one China principle which was accepted by the two sides while the KMT ruled the island, is ""the passphrase"" for cross-Straits cooperation, and now due to the DPP continually refusing to accept the consensus, and even the KMT wanting to keep their distance from the term, there is now no need for the mainland to keep this ""passphrase.""This is actually bad news for the island, as the two sides have lost ""the passphrase"" and it would be more harmful to the island and almost have no impact on the mainland, analysts said.These Taiwan politicians are too naïve because the one China principle will never be abandoned, and ""the 1992 Consensus"" is a vague term which was easy for the two sides to accept in the previous status quo for economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges, and without this vague term, there will be only a ""one-China principle"" in the future, and the options and space for DPP authorities will become even more limited, said Li Fei.The draft decision on establishing and improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for the Hong Kong SAR to safeguard national security was also submitted Friday to the National People's Congress (NPC) for deliberation. Some NPC deputies said that the national security legislation for Hong Kong has referential value regarding the Taiwan issue, the Hong Kong-based takungpao.com.hk reported on Saturday.Whether the mainland adopts a military or peaceful approach to reunify the island of Taiwan, there will be a Taiwan-version of the ""one country, two systems"" to be implemented after reunification, and as the island has similar issues to Hong Kong, such as separatism and anti-China proxies controlled by foreign forces, there will surely be national security legislation for the island as well to deal with these obvious problems at that time, said Li Xiaobing.""The legislation and the future law-enforcement in Hong Kong will be very valuable and meaningful for us to finally solve the Taiwan question one day,"" he noted.

Some NPC deputies said that the national security legislation for Hong Kong has referential value regarding the Taiwan issue, the Hong Kong-based takungpao.com.hk reported on Saturday.Whether the mainland adopts a military or peaceful approach to reunify the island of Taiwan, there will be a Taiwan-version of the ""one country, two systems"" to be implemented after reunification, and as the island has similar issues to Hong Kong, such as separatism and anti-China proxies controlled by foreign forces, there will surely be national security legislation for the island as well to deal with these obvious problems at that time, said Li Xiaobing.""The legislation and the future law-enforcement in Hong Kong will be very valuable and meaningful for us to finally solve the Taiwan question one day,"" he noted.

Photo: cnsphoto China warned Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to stop baseless accusations and slandering the newly proposed national security law in Hong Kong, and warned secessionists on the island of Taiwan and Hong Kong against colluding.It is very important to set up a legislative and executive mechanism to safeguard national security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to maintain national sovereignty, safety, and development, and to sustain the long-term prosperity of HKSAR, said Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson of Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council, noting the bill is to ensure that the ""one country, two systems"" policy remains unshakable.Ma's comments came after Taiwan's DPP made groundless accusations and pointed fingers at the National People's Congress (NPC) on the national security law to be implemented in the HKSAR.The move is widely considered necessary and obligatory in fixing the loopholes within the legislative system of the HKSAR, at a time when intervention and stigmatization from external forces and local separatists continue to erode the foundations of the city.For quite a long time, DPP, along with secessionists from Taiwan and Hong Kong, were colluding to meddle in Hong Kong affairs, taking advantage of Hong Kong's social turmoil, Ma said. He noted those people were also slandering the ""one country, two systems"" policy to further advocate ""Taiwan independence,"" but their goal is doomed to fail.Ma urged the DPP and other parties to stop slandering and making groundless accusations at the NPC's agenda, and meddling in Hong Kong affairs.

(Photo: eng.chinamil.com.cn) The US latest plan to sell arms to the island of Taiwan of 18 torpedoes is overpriced and cannot make any difference in a potential military conflict between the island and the Chinese mainland, and sent a wrong signal to Taiwan secessionists on the day of regional leader Tsai Ing-wen's inaugural speech, mainland military experts said on Thursday.The Chinese side is firmly opposed to the US plan to sell arms to Taiwan and has lodged stern representations with the US side, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a regular press conference on Thursday.Zhao urged the US to abide by the one-China principle, and the three China-US joint communiqués, cancel the plan of arms sale to Taiwan and end its military links with the island before it causes more harm to China-US ties and peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.Zhao and the experts' statements came after the US State Department approved the sale of 18 MK-48 Mod6 Advanced Technology Heavy Weight Torpedoes and related equipment for an estimated $180 million to the island of Taiwan, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing a Wednesday statement by the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency.It aims to serve US national, economic and security interests by supporting Taiwan's ""continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,"" the report cited the agency as saying.This type of torpedo is one of the most advanced heavyweight torpedoes in the world. It will likely be used on the Taiwan military's conventional submarines, and will attack hostile submarines or surface vessels, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times on Thursday.While the powerful US-made torpedoes could become a threat to warships of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), the Taiwan military's submarines are outdated and can easily be spotted and destroyed by the PLA, leaving them with no chance to use the torpedoes, Wei said, noting the arms sales will not make a difference to the military strength across the Straits.According to publicly available information, the cost of each MK-48 is $3.5 million. However in the latest sale, each torpedo was priced at $10 million.Even taking the cost of related equipment into account, this is a far higher price, showing that Taiwan is paying protection money to the US, and the US arms company will make a huge amount of unreasonable profit from this potential deal, analysts said.The announcement of the sale came on the same day as the inaugural speech of Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen. Tsai said in her speech that the island is seeking to bolster asymmetrical capabilities in ""national defense reforms"" to resist the will to reunite with the mainland.Wei said the announcement of the US arms sale at this time is meant to lend support to Taiwan secessionists, and the US is also hoping to have the island pin down the Chinese mainland's military capability, while bringing profits to American arms dealers.This type of torpedo is a very aggressive weapon, and the US is wrongly encouraging Taiwan to use offensive weapons and attack the PLA, Wei said.This is not the first time the US has sold MK-48 torpedoes to Taiwan. In 2017, an arms deal included 46 such torpedoes worth $250 million, reports said.In July 2019, the US approved a possible $2.2 billion arms sale to the island of Taiwan, which included 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles.The Chinese mainland reacted to this US arms sale with large-scale military drills on the southeast coast near the island of Taiwan.

"Cross-Straits ties likely to see ‘a decoupling future’ as Tsai enters 2nd termnFile Photo: Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council. Photo:Xinhua Challenging the bottom line The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council has responded to the ""inauguration speech"" made by the separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) chairperson Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday, saying that the mainland wants to create broad space for peaceful reunification but will leave no space for any act of separatism.""We will show no tolerance for any secessionist act and foreign interference,""Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks after Tsai's speech on Wednesday. He said ""the DPP authority refused to accept the 1992 Consensus on the one-China principle. It has unilaterally destroyed the political foundation for peaceful development between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan.""Chinese mainland experts said that the worsening ties between China and the US, and the US' attempt to unilaterally push for the decoupling of the bilateral relationship will also lead the cross-Straits relationship to ""a decoupling future,"" since the DPP authority sees the worsening China-US ties as a chance for it to realize its separatist political purpose, even though the mainland and compatriots of Taiwan want to maintain cooperation and a peaceful status quo.Ma said, ""National reunification is inevitable as the Chinese nation marches toward its great rejuvenation and cannot be stopped by anyone or any force. Taiwan separatism goes against the tide of the times and is a dead end,"" and the DPP authority is ganging up with foreign forces to damage peace across the Taiwan Straits, and to use the coronavirus pandemic to achieve its separatist purpose.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on his Twitter account on Tuesday, ""Congratulations to Dr. Tsai Ing-wen on the commencement of your second term as Taiwan's President"" and ""With President Tsai at the helm, our partnership with Taiwan will continue to flourish.""The Chinese Foreign Ministry released a statement on Wednesday expressing strong indignation and condemning the act by Pompeo and other US politicians, which seriously violates the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques as well as interferes in China's internal affairs.""The Chinese side will take necessary measures to respond to the wrong actions of the US, and the US should bear the consequences,"" read the statement.Li Fei, a professor at the Taiwan Research Institute of Xiamen University in East China's Fujian Province, told the Global Times that this is the first time in decades that a US Secretary of State has openly sent a message of congratulations to the island's leader and even called her ""president,"" which showed that the separatists on the island and the US now need each other as the US now treats China as its most important rival.Li Xiaobing, a Taiwan studies expert at Nankai University of Tianjin, said that now that the US is unilaterally pushing for decoupling with China, this will also influence the cross-Straits relationship, and if the DPP authority still refuses to accept the 1992 Consensus and carries out more separatist activities, in addition to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be a ""decoupling between the mainland and Taiwan.""Currently, people-to-people exchanges between the mainland and Taiwan are virtually suspended due to worsening ties since the DPP took power in 2016, when the mainland suspended sending individual tours and students to Taiwan.China's Defense Ministry also expressed strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to US Secretary of State Pompeo's congratulatory statement to Tsai, reads a statement the ministry released on Wednesday.The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has the firm will, full confidence and sufficent capability to thwart any form of interference by external forces and secession attempt by ""Taiwan separatists,"" and will take any necessary measures to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and maintain the Taiwan Straits' peace and stability, the Defense Ministry said.Li Fei said the US is encouraging the separatists on the island to test the mainland's bottom line again and again, and the DPP authority will be more provocative in the future, and ""even though the possibility of a war between China and the US remained low, a military conflict between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits is much more likely."" The Liaoning aircraft carrier formation conducted far-sea drills recently and sent birthday greetings to the PLA navy. New relations? In the worst case scenario, the US is unlikely to intervene because of its shortage of money and the People's Liberation Army's overwhelming advantage in the region, said Li Fei. ""According to the US response to Iran in January, the US is now unable and unwilling to afford a massive overseas military operation.""The DPP authority is also seeking military strength to resist the will for reunification from the mainland. In terms of the ""national defense reforms"" that Tsai mentioned in her speech, she plans to bolster asymmetrical capabilities, including mobility, countermeasures and defenses against cyber warfare, cognitive warfare and ""unrestricted"" warfare. Taiwan's military reserves and mobilization systems as well as management institutions are also being targeted for reform and improvement.These reforms were only mentioned in Tsai's speech to boost morale and nothing more, Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Taiwan's military equipment and systems rely heavily on the US and it will be very difficult for them to develop asymmetrical capabilities. The Chinese mainland is developing military capabilities much faster than Taiwan island, and the mainland already possesses an overwhelming military advantage over the island, Song said.According to Ma, a few separatists on the island have even called for ""constitutional amendment"" and an ""independence referendum,"" which all seriously damage peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, Ma warned.Chinese analysts said the DPP authority and the US may understand the danger and keep from crossing the mainland's bottom line, but radical separatist groups within the island could bring uncertainty, and risk bringing about a direct military conflict.If the Chinese mainland decides to reunify the island by force, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) will quickly destroy all of its military bases, leaving the Taiwan military's aircraft, vessels and missiles with little chance to join the battle, Song said, noting that the PLA will also apply electromagnetic suppression on the island, rendering all of the Taiwan military's radars and communication systems useless.The military forces of Taiwan island will not be able to resist the PLA at all, and the PLA's military struggle preparations would instead be aimed at US forces, which could intervene, Song said. ""If a war breaks out, we should worry about the Taiwan military and its weapons and equipment fleeing to US military bases in Japan under US orders. Intercepting this retreat operation is an important task for the PLA,"" he said.Ling Yu-shih, a Hong Kong member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, who was born in Taiwan and later emigrated to Hong Kong, is now in Beijing to attend the upcoming two sessions. She told the Global Times that she will raise Taiwan-related proposals.She noted that Taiwan authorities have renewed the notion of ""Taiwan independence"" from the legal, systematic, cultural and people's psychological perspectives, and they are good at wording when referring to relations with the mainland. For instance, they regard Taiwan as a ""country"" and call the mainland ""China.""""Therefore, we should be careful in using terms such as 'cross-Straits' and 'Taiwan Straits' that were defined by the Americans, as these terms signal governance division and confrontation on an equal footing,"" Ling said.The Chinese mainland will continue to unite the compatriots of Taiwan, and promote exchange and cooperation to push cross-Straits integration development, and will maintain dialogue and consultation with political parties on the island based on the 1992 Consensus and an anti-separatism political foundation to push for peaceful reunification, Ma said.Ling suggested changing the name of the ""Mainland travel permit for Taiwan residents"" to ""Residence permit for People's Republic of China (Taiwan area) residents"", and changing the administrative relations between the central government and Taiwan to relations between the central government and a province.""We previously emphasized that Taiwan is an integral part of China. In the future, we can put the emphasis on Taiwan as a province of China,"" Ling said.Ling believes regulating Taiwan-related terms will serve as a warning to Taiwan and also reaffirm the will of the Chinese people.

"Experts predict 3 pct growth in China’s military budget amid rising defense needsnThe commissioning ceremony of Shandong aircraft carrier is held at a naval port in Sanya, south China's Hainan Province, Dec. 17, 2019. China's first domestically built aircraft carrier, the Shandong, was delivered to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy and placed in active service on Dec. 17 at a naval port in Sanya. The new aircraft carrier, named after Shandong Province in east China, was given the hull number 17. (Xinhua/Li Gang) China's defense budget draft for 2020 is expected to be released on Friday, the first day of the annual National People's Congress (NPC), with most Chinese military observers reached by the Global Times believing the figure will continue to rise amid the ""black swan"" COVID-19 pandemic that has impacted China's economy but also raised additional national defense demands.In a Global Times survey with nine military experts, three calculated a growth rate of around 3 percent, leading to a possible budget of about 1.22 trillion yuan ($171.5 billion), one predicted a 5 to 6 percent growth to about 1.25 trillion yuan, three said it was difficult to forecast, and two said a shrink is possible.China takes into consideration the development of the economy and the demands of national defense when deciding on the appropriate scale and composition of defense expenditure, according to the national defense white paper issued by the State Council Information Office in July 2019.Both these elements favor growth, although the growth rate could become slower, analysts said.China's defense budget for 2019 was 1.19 trillion yuan, up 7.5 percent from 2018. China has maintained single-digit growth in its annual defense budget since 2016. China's defense budget 2011-2020 In the past three decades, China has kept its military expenditure/GDP ratio to under 2 percent. In the last 10 years, this figure was maintained at around 1.3 percent, according to the 2019 white paper.This overall trend is unlikely to change drastically, analysts said.Despite China's economy contracting 6.8 percent in the first three months of the year due to quarantines introduced as an important measure to control and prevent COVID-19, which has restricted many kinds of businesses and trade activities, the country's economy is already restarting following the comprehensive work resumptions and daily activities along with normalized epidemic control measures. Many economists recently reached by the Global Times predicted a 3 percent GDP increase for the year 2020 Beijing-based military expert Li Jie told the Global Times that China's military budget will likely follow the general direction of the economy and grow based on the increase in GDP, so while this year's defense budget will not grow as fast as in last year, a slight growth should still be expected.Some optimistic GDP growth predictions of 2 to 3 percent indicate a similar growth in the military budget, but the final expenditure could be adjusted according to the actual situation, Li said.If GDP growth is assumed to be at about 3 percent, the defense budget should also aim for a similar growth, a Chinese military expert who asked not to be named told the Global Times.Deviations in the military budget could also occur based on the projected military expenditure/GDP ratio, which could fluctuate within the 2 percent range, the anonymous expert predicted.Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military analyst, also voiced a similar prediction.Wei told the Global Times that a defense budget growth rate lower than 5 percent would match China's current economic and financial situation.A lowered defense budget growth would be a rational choice, because it will not overwhelm the country's finances and would still ensure the military's training and exercises as well as key projects in weapons and equipment development, Wei said.China has been facing additional national defense threats from Western countries headed by the US.Since the start of 2020, the US has been frequently sending warships and warplanes into the South China Sea and East China Sea, with some crossing the Taiwan Straits, sending wrong signals to Taiwan secessionists. This situation was exacerbated after US aircraft carriers were hit by COVID-19 in March.According to a report released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in April, the US has driven global military expenditure growth, spending a whopping $732 billion in 2019. By comparison, China spent only $261 billion. The number for China in the SIPRI report is higher than China's official figure. Top 10 countries by military spending in 2019 China needs to moderately increase its defense budget and boost its military capabilities, particularly under the current complicated circumstances and with the US making provocations near China, Li said.Wei said that China still needs to develop and produce more advanced weapons and equipment, and increase salaries and benefits for officers and soldiers, and a continuously increasing budget will provide sufficient funding.The above-mentioned anonymous expert said that despite several technological breakthroughs in military equipment, China still operates a vast arsenal of outdated weapons such as Type 59 tanks and J-7 fighter jets. They need to be replaced by advanced weapons like Type 99A and Type 15 tanks and J-10 fighter jets. The numbers of China's most advanced weapons such as the J-20 fighter jet, Type 055 large destroyer and aircraft carriers are also limited and require huge amount of funding.China needs to continue expanding its naval arsenal and conduct frequent patrols and exercises in related waters to safeguard China's territorial integrity and national sovereignty, the expert said.According to a report submitted to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in 2017, the Chinese armed forces should achieve mechanization in 2020, Xinhua reported.Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times that China should step up its military preparedness given the increasing military pressures from countries and regions like the US, so the military budget increase should be kept the same as last year although a slightly lowered growth rate will also be acceptable.In the post-pandemic period, the international and regional situation might further deteriorate in a manner that is unfavorable to China, Song said, noting that boosting investment in a strong national defense field will also ensure a peaceful environment in which the Chinese economy can continue to steadily develop.The funding will also go to the Chinese military's non-combat capabilities, Song said.The Chinese military has played vital roles in China's achievements in overcoming the COVID-19 epidemic. Thousands of medical personnel from military medical units were dispatched via military transport means to aid Wuhan in Central China's Hubei Province, the city hit hardest by the epidemic in the country, while top Chinese military scientists are leading the world in COVID-19 vaccine development.They have also provided solid support to the Chinese people, helping them overcome major disasters like the epidemic, return to normal lives and enjoy stable economy development, Song said. An increased military budget will be worth it, he said.An expanding defense budget would also give more funding to China's military research and development, which is actually boosting domestic demand at a time when exports are being hit by the pandemic, Song said, noting that this will bring momentum to the economy and enhance China's technological level, which will in turn boost the economy further.

"Tsai must be warned for her to stay sober: Global Times editorialnTourists view the Taipei 101 skyscraper, a landmark in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan, Jan. 2, 2017. (Xinhua/Zhu Xiang) Tsai Ing-wen began her second term on May 20. Her inaugural speech regarding cross-Straits relations played the same old tune. On the one hand, she repeated words such as ""peace,"" while on the other, she intends to lead Taiwan further tilted to the US to confront the mainland amid mounting tensions between China and the US. The situation in the Taiwan Straits is hardly optimistic.The authorities of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have strategically miscalculated. They believe the US view of China as its main strategic competitor helps them seek Taiwan secession.While they act as a pawn of the US, they want to use the support of the US to achieve a complete decoupling with the mainland and be included in the US security alliance like a NATO member.They are unwilling to face the fact that the one-China principle is one of the important cornerstones of the world order, and that even the US dare not openly deny it, but arrogantly think that Taiwan could seek secession with its tiny strength.Their strategic space is pretty small. They are maneuvering in a small pond in the cracks of China-US relations, but mistakenly take it as a big river or sea. The Tsai authorities should have a clear estimation of themselves.The DPP's narrative of the superiority of ""Taiwan democracy"" deceives the people of the island. They should not get into it too deeply to believe they can do whatever they want against the mainland.We want to pour buckets of cold water on Tsai to help her stay sober.First, the Tsai authorities have no strength to break the global political structure in which there is only one China.The US has also no real interest in undermining the one-China pattern. What Washington wants is to create trouble for Beijing by making an issue of the one-China principle and using it as leverage against Beijing.Second, Taiwan island is playing a very dangerous game as a US pawn to contain China. The island needs to tread a fine line.In the game in which two elephants - China and the US - fight, Taiwan is not a tiger or a hyena, but an ant. It needs to act very cautiously, rather than being provocative.Third, the US is ratcheting up pressure on China, but the gap of military strength between the two in the Taiwan Straits is going the other way. The DPP authorities need to study the Anti-Secession Law carefully. They'd better study the law together and invite mailand scholars to give them a lecture. The US will be unable to prevent the mainland if the latter decides to respond to Taiwan's provocative actions with military means.The most important thing for the DPP authorities is that they should focus on the internal affairs of the island. They don't have ability to alter the political and military pattern in the Taiwan Straits, nor will they be able to control the situation after they start trouble and trigger a chain reaction. The Tsai authorities should act prudently. "	5/20/20	0	1	0.9341	1
"US and Taiwan cannot afford starting new game over Taiwan question: Global Times editorialnA Chinese community in Los Angeles calls for reunification and protests Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen making a stopover in the US in August 2018. Photo: cnsphoto US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sent a congratulatory message to Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen on the eve of May 20 congratulating her on the commencement of second term in office. He called Tsai Ing-wen ""President"" and praised Taiwan as a highly reliable partner. It was the first time in recent decades that a US Secretary of State has publicly congratulated a Taiwanese leader on the start of her term.Pompeo is clearly doing it to challenge Beijing. Yes, we see the US government moving backwards on the Taiwan question trying to challenge Beijing's bottom line on this question in a ""salami slicing"" approach. At the same time, it is intended to provoke the Chinese mainland, throwing out cards one by one as a game with Beijing.The Chinese mainland is very sober. We won't get carried away by Washington's moves, and new arrangement regarding game over Taiwan question will be made. We will firmly grasp the strategic initiative of the situation in this region and finally smash all attempts by the US and Taiwan.Beijing cannot control what Washington politicians speak. When the US politicians speak in accordance with the old rules of Sino-US relations, it is a scenario of Sino-US relations and the situation across the Taiwan Strait, with which Beijing interacts. When Washington breaks that rule, Sino-US relations and the situation across the Taiwan Strait are in flux, and we naturally adjust our response and play our cards.Washington and the Tsai administration are so narcissistic that they think they can make the mainland uncomfortable and have nothing to do by saying a few words. After the traditional interaction between China and the US on the Taiwan question has been broken, the future will be up to the two sides. Who will suffer more next? It is hard to say.What ultimately determines the direction of the situation across the Taiwan Strait is a contest of strength. The mainland's military strength has been able to effectively overwhelm the Taiwan military and deter the US military. The economic power between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is tilted toward the mainland. This is the broad outline of the situation across the Taiwan Strait.The one-China principle is widely recognized internationally, and it is one of the cornerstones of the current world order. Beijing's ability to mobilize resources from the international community will be greater than that of the US and Taiwan when they collide with the Chinese mainland to break and defend the one-china principle. Washington being snubbed at bringing Taiwan to the WHA is a clear illustration of this.Beijing does not need to react directly to Pompeo's call to congratulate Tsai Ing-wen on her second term, but we need to take note.The diplomatic landscape could end up like this: Taiwan's allies will be cut to zero, and only Washington is likely to give it some preferential treatment. But this preferential treatment, if it violates the Anti-Secession law, this would mean the end of all previous games on Taiwan question overnight.China is becoming more powerful, and our ability to claim sovereignty over Taiwan is certainly growing.

However, the two-day meeting closed with the majority of countries agreeing on a resolution co-sponsored by China, showing the global consensus reached on joint efforts in fighting the COVID19 disease and evaluating WHO's response in an comprehensive and objective way, experts said.They noted that such consensus also rejected political bias led by some Western politicians, and major proposals highlighted by the resolution are in line with the consistent position of the Chinese side, which some Chinese analysts said could be seen as a diplomatic victory for Beijing.The US, Australia and the island of Taiwan have become the largest losers at this year's WHA meeting, as they were either isolated or abandoned by the global community for continuing to politicize the pandemic and diverting the joint efforts in fighting this battle, some Chinese experts said. More than 120 countries agreed to a resolution carrying two key messages - identifying the zoonotic source of the coronavirus and evaluating the WHO's COVID-19 response, which was officially passed by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday.The resolution also sent a clear message to the world that countries are sharing the consensus of taking the anti-epidemic battle as the top priority, recognizing the leading role the WHO has played, and evaluating the WHO's COVID-19 should be impartial and justified led by scientists and professionals.The WHO voted and passed a seven-page resolution on COVID-19 response, after over 120 countries reportedly formed a coalition to come up with a draft paper, first proposed by the EU and later supported by countries like Australia and Russia. The resolution calls for support from all countries for their request to implement a multi-sector action plan in strengthening their health systems against the COVID-19 pandemic, working collaboratively at all levels to developing and scaling up effective and affordable diagnostics, therapeutics, medicine and vaccines, according to the paper seen on the WHO website.The resolution also called for the use of existing mechanisms to review experience gained and lessons learned from the WHO-coordinated international health response to COVID-19. However, this initiative has been misinterpreted by some Western politicians and media outlets as being a probe into China's initial handling of the outbreak, first hyped up by countries like Australia.By approving the resolution, the global community rejected the move of politicizing both the pandemic and the WHA meeting led by some Western politicians including Australian officials and American hawks by ignoring the Australia-backed probe targeting China, while not even mentioning the issue relevant to the island of Taiwan in its meeting agenda, no matter how hard Washington has been trying to push Taiwan's membership in the meeting with the aim of challenging the sovereignty of the China. China's National Health Commission (NHC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) jointly hold a video conference to brief China's experience on COVID-19 response to international experts from various countries and representatives of some embassies in China and international organizations on Thursday. Photo: screenshot of the NHC Three losers In a complete and sharp contrast to China, which offered a series of proposals at the WHA meeting, including providing $2 billion over two years to help this battle, making China's COVID-19 vaccines global public goods when available and working with G20 members, the US has become the biggest loser for being isolated and marginalized, reflecting its failure in global governance, some Chinese analysts said, noting that such incompetence was amplified after it failed to besiege China at the WHO with the help of two of its biggest pawns - Australia and the island of Taiwan.Contrary to China's commitment to the global anti-epidemic fight, US President Donald Trump escalated his ""blame game"" toward China and the WHO - an old-fashioned tactics used by some US politicians over the past few months in diverting public attention on their mishandling of the unprecedented public health crisis in the US.Trump tweeted a letter to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday, in which he harshly criticized the organization's ""dependence"" on China in its decision-making process and COVID-19 response. Trump also wrote in the letter that if the WHO ""does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days,"" he will make the temporary freeze of US funding to the WHO permanent and reconsider its membership of the organization.""Trump got frustrated as he believes the WHO failed to accomplish the mission to help him pass the buck to China, and this is why he threatened to freeze its funding to the WHO,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. ""The angrier he is, the more incompetent he becomes in handling the crisis,"" Li said.Besides furious attacks, the US government has been trying to bring the matter of Taiwan into the WHA to provoke the Chinese mainland, which, however, was doomed to fail no matter how hard some US lawmakers and officials like US State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus tried to support the island and challenge the universally accepted one-China principle. A store in New York, US, puts up a notice which reads ""No Mask, No Entry"" on Monday. According to data from the John Hopkins University, as of press time on Tuesday, the US has reported more than 1,508,900 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the largest number in the world with the death toll at more than 90,000. Photo: AFP Failed attempts The attempt to push for proposals related to Taiwan at the WHA by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the island of Taiwan once again failed the moment the WHA announced it would not discuss such proposals.Only state members of the WHO have the right to attend the WHA. However, the DPP and pro-independence groups in the island of Taiwan have been working hard to push for Taiwan's attendance at the WHA ""as an observer"" since 2017.Compared to previous years, Ms Keva Bain from the Bahamas, president of this year's WHA, was more ""decisive and clear"" about not discussing Taiwan-related proposals, experts said.An insider familiar with this year's WHA said that so far, more than 160 countries have reiterated their support to the one-China principle and more than 50 countries sent letters to WHO General-Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to oppose the Taiwan-related proposal.Chinese mainland analysts said that the separatist DPP in Taiwan thought that it has found the ""big brother"" - the Trump administration - and it has paid a huge amount of money to flatter the US. But the ""big brother"" is not as reliable as they have thought, since all efforts they paid to challenge the one-China principle in the WHA failed, as always.""They just don't get it. If they really want to be a WHA observer, the most effective path is through Beijing, not through Washington. That's why they are wasting money by begging the wrong boss but offend the one who can really help,"" a Beijing-based observer said, who requested anonymity. ""What a hilarious behavior!""The third loser was Australia, which has been actively pushing for a so-called independent inquiry into the origins of the crisis in recent days, aimed at China. Australia's act was widely believed to be instigated by Washington. Some Australian politicians, including Australia's foreign minister Marise Payne, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton, have been in a bullish mood, as some media reports said, in criticizing China for its lack of transparency, and vowed to stand up for their values.Some Australian media outlets see this as a move aimed at further pressuring China and seeking to hold Beijing accountable for the outbreak, calling on Beijing to face overwhelming global pressure at the WHA meeting.""This is a totally different thing from the so-called independent inquiry pushed by the Australian side,"" Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told a routine press conference on Tuesday on the resolution approved by the international community. Along with other countries, China has been actively taking part in the negotiations on this resolution, which clearly recognizes and supports the leadership of the WHO amid the pandemic, he noted.Some Chinese netizens also mocked Australia's attempts as it has been trying to become a ""martyr"" for defending so-called independence and transparency while its ideas were denounced by the global community. By following the steps of some US hawks who harshly attack China over coronavirus, ""it seems that Australia, this giant kangaroo that serves as a dog of the US, will hit a deadlock with China on trade disputes in sectors like coal and beef. Hopefully, the US will compensate it!"" one netizen said in a Weibo post on Tuesday.Meanwhile, on the matter of Taiwan, some politicians and US media praised the island for preventing the pandemic and using this as an excuse to support the island to attend the assembly. But they ignored the fact that Taiwan has fewer infected cases simply because the mainland and shared all the information it got to the island at the earliest time, and Taiwan's necessary technical cooperation with the WHO have never been interrupted, Chinese analysts noted.""Taiwan is an island which was almost automatically locked down from the mainland as it can connect with the mainland only by air and sea. And due to the worsening cross-Straits relationship, people-to-people exchanges between the two sides have been mostly suspended, so it is not hard for Taiwan to keep the number low,"" Li Xiaobing, a Taiwan studies expert at Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times previously.Compared to other Chinese provinces, Taiwan did not have the best performance. For instance, Jiangsu Province with more than 80 million people, about three times more than Taiwan's population, has only 51 confirmed cases and all were cured with zero deaths as of Monday, according to the latest data released by the Jiangsu provincial government website.But Taiwan has 440 confirmed cases and seven deaths, according to Taiwan's public health authority.Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the mainland also shared epidemic-related information and technologies with Taiwan 155 times as of Monday, and 16 groups of 24 experts from Taiwan have taken part in technical activities organized by the WHO since 2019.Netizens from the mainland and island of Taiwan ridiculed the DPP for ""betting on the wrong horse."" ""US President Trump and his administration have been haunted by the failure to control the virus domestically and are busy blaming China and the WHO. Why does the Taiwan authority rely on 'a partner' who is threatening to withdraw from the WHO?"" a netizen surnamed Liu said.While all parties have reached consensus on a draft resolution after consultations with member states, the Chinese side called for initiating a review of the WHO-coordinated COVID-19 response at the appropriate moment with an impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation process to review experiences gained and lessons learned, which is also a routine practice for the WHO.For instance, the WHO previously conducted a post-epidemic evaluation of the H1N1 response and Ebola.

"Japan's support for Taiwan 'hypocritical' move that echoes US: analystsnPhoto: VCG Japan's Foreign Ministry touched on the island of Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO) and continued to be in favor of the island's participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly (WHA), which was the first time it has mentioned this since the island's attempt to join the WHA was rejected in 2017, and some Chinese analysts said the Japanese side adopting this stance simply echoes US sentiment.According to local media reports, the 2020 Diplomatic Bluebook emphasized that Taiwan is a critically important partner to Japan while the relationship between Japanese and Taiwan residents is generally good, and the two sides see close people-to-people exchange. It has changed the description of the island from 'important partner' in the 2019 edition to 'critically important' and increased content related to the island from half a page last year to one page.""By the Trump administration trying to pass the buck to the Chinese mainland to divert attention away from conflicts in the country and smear China's reputation in a choreographed manner, the Japanese side has been influenced by the international environment,"" Zhou Yongsheng, professor of China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday.An expert on the question of Taiwan, who preferred not to be named, said ""relations"" between the island of Taiwan and Japan are actually ""special and close."" No matter if it's about clearly supporting the island as an observer to WHA or seeing Taiwan ties as critically important, those moves could be seen as important signals in enhancing its ties with the island.""However, under the former regional leadership of Ma Ying-jeou, the island could have joined WHA because both sides of cross-Straits had basic political trust. Japan is not aware of that perspective, which is regretful,"" the expert said.The 2020 edition also reiterated that this year would be a period for propelling Japan-China ties into a new era of bilateral relations, addressing the intention of re-coordinating arrangements for China's leader to visit Japan as a state guest.""Expressions of willingness for Chinese leader's visit to Japan send out a positive signal. As long as Japan upholds the one-China principle, its expressions on the island of Taiwan won't pose a significant impact on China-Japan ties,"" Zhang Wensheng, deputy dean of the Taiwan Research Institute of Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Although Japan expressed its support for Taiwan as an observer to WHA, whether it can join is not up to Japan, while we cannot exclude the possibility that such a move is ""hypocritical"" after considering the US mood, Zhang said.However, it should still draw attention to Japan trying to enhance interaction with the island, and normalize support for the island on a global stage or even have concrete relations with it, Zhang said, noting that China and Japan are now seeing their relations improving with enhancing political trust, and Japan should focus on safeguarding bilateral ties and be cautious on the Taiwan question.

And the WHA president would give the final say. The Taiwan-related proposals were rejected by the presidents in the previous three years.At the 50th WHA in 1997, the Taiwan authority incited its ""diplomatic allies"" to start a vote among all member states and got 128 vetoes, 19 votes and five abstentions. The proposal to take in Taiwan in the WHA as an observer failed to get approved. The assembly was prolonged for five and a half hours.This year's WHA kicked off amid the global COVID-19 pandemic with the assembly being shortened to two days and in the form of a video conference.The WHA president chose to reject the Taiwan-related proposal without debate. This move shows that the political practice should not take the precious time of the international community's discussions on fighting the COVID-19. It also proves that the DPP's attempt to use the WHA to seek separatism of the island was opposed by the international community, experts said.An insider familiar with this year's WHA said that so far, more than 160 countries have reiterated their support to the one-China principle and more than 50 countries sent letters to WHO General-Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to oppose the Taiwan proposal.Netizens from the Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan ridiculed the DPP for ""betting on the wrong horse.""""US President Donald Trump and his administration have been haunted by the failure to control the virus domestically and are busy blaming China and the WHO.

"Experts predict 3 pct growth in China’s military budget amid rising defense needsnThe commissioning ceremony of Shandong aircraft carrier is held at a naval port in Sanya, south China's Hainan Province, Dec. 17, 2019. China's first domestically built aircraft carrier, the Shandong, was delivered to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy and placed in active service on Dec. 17 at a naval port in Sanya. The new aircraft carrier, named after Shandong Province in east China, was given the hull number 17. (Xinhua/Li Gang) China's defense budget draft for 2020 is expected to be released on Friday, the first day of the annual National People's Congress (NPC), with most Chinese military observers reached by the Global Times believing the figure will continue to rise amid the ""black swan"" COVID-19 pandemic that has impacted China's economy but also raised additional national defense demands.In a Global Times survey with nine military experts, three calculated a growth rate of around 3 percent, leading to a possible budget of about 1.22 trillion yuan ($171.5 billion), one predicted a 5 to 6 percent growth to about 1.25 trillion yuan, three said it was difficult to forecast, and two said a shrink is possible.China takes into consideration the development of the economy and the demands of national defense when deciding on the appropriate scale and composition of defense expenditure, according to the national defense white paper issued by the State Council Information Office in July 2019.Both these elements favor growth, although the growth rate could become slower, analysts said.China's defense budget for 2019 was 1.19 trillion yuan, up 7.5 percent from 2018. China has maintained single-digit growth in its annual defense budget since 2016. China's defense budget 2011-2020 In the past three decades, China has kept its military expenditure/GDP ratio to under 2 percent. In the last 10 years, this figure was maintained at around 1.3 percent, according to the 2019 white paper.This overall trend is unlikely to change drastically, analysts said.Despite China's economy contracting 6.8 percent in the first three months of the year due to quarantines introduced as an important measure to control and prevent COVID-19, which has restricted many kinds of businesses and trade activities, the country's economy is already restarting following the comprehensive work resumptions and daily activities along with normalized epidemic control measures. Many economists recently reached by the Global Times predicted a 3 percent GDP increase for the year 2020 Beijing-based military expert Li Jie told the Global Times that China's military budget will likely follow the general direction of the economy and grow based on the increase in GDP, so while this year's defense budget will not grow as fast as in last year, a slight growth should still be expected.Some optimistic GDP growth predictions of 2 to 3 percent indicate a similar growth in the military budget, but the final expenditure could be adjusted according to the actual situation, Li said.If GDP growth is assumed to be at about 3 percent, the defense budget should also aim for a similar growth, a Chinese military expert who asked not to be named told the Global Times.Deviations in the military budget could also occur based on the projected military expenditure/GDP ratio, which could fluctuate within the 2 percent range, the anonymous expert predicted.Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military analyst, also voiced a similar prediction.Wei told the Global Times that a defense budget growth rate lower than 5 percent would match China's current economic and financial situation.A lowered defense budget growth would be a rational choice, because it will not overwhelm the country's finances and would still ensure the military's training and exercises as well as key projects in weapons and equipment development, Wei said.China has been facing additional national defense threats from Western countries headed by the US.Since the start of 2020, the US has been frequently sending warships and warplanes into the South China Sea and East China Sea, with some crossing the Taiwan Straits, sending wrong signals to Taiwan secessionists. This situation was exacerbated after US aircraft carriers were hit by COVID-19 in March.According to a report released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in April, the US has driven global military expenditure growth, spending a whopping $732 billion in 2019. By comparison, China spent only $261 billion. The number for China in the SIPRI report is higher than China's official figure. Top 10 countries by military spending in 2019 China needs to moderately increase its defense budget and boost its military capabilities, particularly under the current complicated circumstances and with the US making provocations near China, Li said.Wei said that China still needs to develop and produce more advanced weapons and equipment, and increase salaries and benefits for officers and soldiers, and a continuously increasing budget will provide sufficient funding.The above-mentioned anonymous expert said that despite several technological breakthroughs in military equipment, China still operates a vast arsenal of outdated weapons such as Type 59 tanks and J-7 fighter jets. They need to be replaced by advanced weapons like Type 99A and Type 15 tanks and J-10 fighter jets. The numbers of China's most advanced weapons such as the J-20 fighter jet, Type 055 large destroyer and aircraft carriers are also limited and require huge amount of funding.China needs to continue expanding its naval arsenal and conduct frequent patrols and exercises in related waters to safeguard China's territorial integrity and national sovereignty, the expert said.According to a report submitted to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in 2017, the Chinese armed forces should achieve mechanization in 2020, Xinhua reported.Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times that China should step up its military preparedness given the increasing military pressures from countries and regions like the US, so the military budget increase should be kept the same as last year although a slightly lowered growth rate will also be acceptable.In the post-pandemic period, the international and regional situation might further deteriorate in a manner that is unfavorable to China, Song said, noting that boosting investment in a strong national defense field will also ensure a peaceful environment in which the Chinese economy can continue to steadily develop.The funding will also go to the Chinese military's non-combat capabilities, Song said.The Chinese military has played vital roles in China's achievements in overcoming the COVID-19 epidemic. Thousands of medical personnel from military medical units were dispatched via military transport means to aid Wuhan in Central China's Hubei Province, the city hit hardest by the epidemic in the country, while top Chinese military scientists are leading the world in COVID-19 vaccine development.They have also provided solid support to the Chinese people, helping them overcome major disasters like the epidemic, return to normal lives and enjoy stable economy development, Song said. An increased military budget will be worth it, he said.An expanding defense budget would also give more funding to China's military research and development, which is actually boosting domestic demand at a time when exports are being hit by the pandemic, Song said, noting that this will bring momentum to the economy and enhance China's technological level, which will in turn boost the economy further.

"Taiwan separatist lobby try hijacking US policynA Chinese community in Los Angeles calls for reunification and protests Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen making a stopover in the US in August 2018. Photo: cnsphoto Influencing US foreign policy Since the US identified China as its major strategic competitor, separatists of Taiwan island have been taking advantage of the widening rifts to influence US foreign policy. The Taiwan lobby aims to shake the foundation of the China-US relationship and has renewed sway among US politicians in the White House and Congress.The separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of Taiwan has seemingly gained achievements in recent years.US Congress has passed legislation encouraging Taiwan separatism and provoking China's sovereignty. The Taiwan Travel Act, signed by the Trump administration in 2018, allows leaders of Taiwan to travel to the US as all but diplomatic representatives. Passed in March, The Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act calls on international organizations to increase the island's so-called diplomatic scope.Most recently, the White House has made efforts to politicize the World Health Assembly (WHA) by encouraging its allies to support Taiwan to join the assembly without respecting the one-China principle.The DPP and pro-Taiwan independence US politicians might believe they have created many troubles for the Chinese mainland with little cost, and they can even earn benefits from each other without significant punishment from China, but in fact, they are endangering the peace of the West Pacific region experts warned.When China realizes the US completely changed its promise to respect the one-China principle, as well as abandoned its official neutrality on Taiwan affairs, the mainland would probably decide peaceful reunification is unlikely to realize. The mainland will be forced to prepare non-peaceful measure, and at that time, Taiwan separatists and US warmongers will lose, said mainland analysts.Taiwan lobbying in the US can be traced back to the World War II. The Kuomintang regime at the time sent delegations to lobby the US asking for support in the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, and after 1949 when the KMT lost the civil war and retreated to Taiwan, the island's authority also lobbied the US to build a ""joint defense alliance"" against the mainland.When the US established formal diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China in 1979, Taiwan had used its lobby groups to ensure the US passed the Taiwan Relations Act to maintain some connections between the island and the US under table, including arm sales.The bipartisan Congressional Taiwan Caucus is the second largest Congressional Member Organization in the United States Congress with 139 members. The caucus focuses exclusively on improving US ties with the island. Chinese mainland analysts noted that apart from Israeli lobby groups, advocacy groups from Taiwan are likely the ones that spent the most money influencing US foreign policy.Yuan Zheng, a research fellow and expert on Taiwan lobbying activities in the US at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times ""Taiwan has paid a lot of efforts to maintain its ties with US congressional members by inviting them to travel to the island and also building personal relations with their families.""Especially with the conservative Republicans with anti-Communist mentality, the island has found common ideological ground with them. After the island kicked off Western neoliberal democratic reform in the 1980s, the Democrats also found they have political values in common, so even though Taiwan politicians provided material benefits to influence US foreign policy, they would not be criticized in US public opinion due to ideological reasons, Yuan said. US Congress Photos: cnsphoto Money and politics In the US, the Chinese mainland doesn't have such capacity to influence Congress even though it has more money than Taiwan and is more powerful. Due to ideological difference, it would be a ""political suicide"" if any US politician dares to help the mainland, even if it could benefit both sides, Yuan added.The two major political parties of the island all have their own lobby groups in the US. The KMT has held a pro-reunification stance and had deeper connection with the US. The separatist DPP was not considered as trustworthy as the KMT in the 2000s, US worried the DPP's extreme separatism held by the island's then-leader Chen Shui-bian would send the US to unnecessary frictions with the Chinese mainland.""The time has changed. At that time, the Bush administration needed China's support to its Global War on Terror, as the biggest enemy to the US at that time was terrorists, so it will surely try its best to make sure China-US ties were stable and suppress separatists of the island,"" Yuan said.In 2016, according to CNN, the DPP officials hired US senator-turned-lobbyist Bob Dole to set up a controversial phone call between then president-elect Donald Trump and Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen, marking a shift in the US attitude toward cross-Straits relations.""I've never met a member of Congress who says 'I don't support Taiwan issues,'"" said Coen Blaauw, executive director of the Washington-based Taiwan advocacy group Formosan Association for Public Relations, the VOA reported on March 27, 2019 in a report about the Taiwan advocacy groups influencing the quick rising ties between the US and the island.Yuan said although the DPP and the KMT have sponsored and run different lobby groups in the US, they now share common interests, and due to the fact that they have deep ties with local Chinese Americans, they can even help the local US politicians, including senators, run for election.""For instance, Global Taiwan Institute, a new lobby group backed by the DPP, was sponsored by local Chinese American businessmen,"" and they can make Chinese Americans vote, and provide political contribution to US politicians for local elections, so they share a lot of common interests, Yuan said.The power comparison between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits has totally lost balance as the mainland has overwhelming advantage in economy, military, politics and technology, so the US believes that if it just maintains its previous policy, the mainland will soon reunify with Taiwan and Washington will lose its most important card that could effectively provoke and contain the Chinese mainland, said an anonymous Taiwan-based military observer.""So the politicians in both the US and the island will have more excuses and legitimacy to boost arms sales and they can earn more profits from the business,"" he noted.Li Xiaobing, a Taiwan studies expert at Nankai University in Tianjin, said that in fact, the most important reason for Taiwan to influence the US foreign policy is the island's status, which is a key matter the US can exploit to contain the Chinese mainland, and that Taiwan is a major client to US military industrial companies and is willing to spend high prices to buy outdated weapons. ""So the interests are always entangled with corruption under the table."" Chinese demonstrators sing songs and chant slogans while waiting for the arrival of Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen in Los Angeles in August 2018. As Tsai arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel, she was greeted by peaceful Chinese demonstrators of all ages and from all walks of life. They were holding flags, banners and signs bearing the slogan ""One China."" The crowd began chanting ""One China!"" and ""Oppose Taiwan Independence!"" as Tsai pulled into the hotel. Photo: Wang Rujun Dangerous moves The US-based Project 2049 Institute is one of the organizations that frequently receive ""donations"" from Taiwan authorities, the Global Times found. Ian Easton, a research fellow from the institute, published an article in March advocating that ""America should put military forces in Taiwan"" in return for Taiwan island's long-term funding and to cater to the rise of US containment of the Chinese mainland.The Taiwan representative office in the US in 2016 gave the institute $150,000 in funding, while the Taiwan ""defense department"" also donated about $130,000. Additionally, the Prospect Foundation, a think tank in Taiwan focused on security, donated $60,000-70,000 to the Project 2049 Institute.If Taiwan lobby groups and US politicians keep moving in this direction, the possibility of a peaceful reunification by the mainland will decline sharply, and this is truly dangerous for them, Li said.Lü Xiang, a research fellow on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, said that the US has no capability to protect Taiwan once the separatists cross the red line, since the mainland now has the overwhelming military advantage to solve this long-standing problem, therefore ""the more tricks they play to challenge our principle, the nearer we get to reunification.""However, the DPP and other separatists of the island don't really believe the mainland dares to solve the Taiwan question by force as they believe the mainland is preoccupied by other problems, Yuan said.""They might push something like an illegal 'independence referendum' to challenge the Chinese mainland's bottom line, and if the US made no effort to suppress these dangerous attempts, the mainland might have no choice but to respond with ultimate measures,"" said Jin Canrong, associate dean of Renmin University of China's School of International Studies in Beijing.

Photo: Xinhua Chinese technology giant Huawei is likely to stockpile more semiconductor chips during the 120-day grace period following the US government's intensified restrictions to cut off supplies, industry insiders said.They added that global chip makers, including the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), will likely skew their production ability toward supplying Huawei during the grace period .Taiwan media reported on Monday that TSMC, the world's biggest contract chipmaker and also a key Huawei supplier, received a large chip order worth $700 million from Huawei, in which TSMC will produce high-end 5nm and 7nm chips.A senior industry analyst familiar with the chip supply chain confirmed the news to the Global Times, noting that the Huawei order was made last week, ""right before the US government tightened the ban.""""Time is short and it's really a matter of speed now,"" said the insider.On Friday, the US Department of Commerce said it was amending an export rule and its Entity List to ""strategically target Huawei's acquisition of semiconductors that are the direct product of certain US software and technology,"" according to a statement on its website. The rule will come into effect on Friday but with a 120-day grace period.In response to the ban, Huawei said in a statement on Monday that ""it categorically opposes the amendments made by the US Department of Commerce to its foreign direct product rule that target Huawei specifically,"" adding that the US decision was ""arbitrary and pernicious,"" and threatens to undermine the entire industry worldwide.""Huawei could have anticipated that the US was going to intensify its chip ban, as Friday marks one year since the Chinese firm was placed on the US Entity List - that's also why it has made its orders right before the deadline,"" Ma Jihua, an industry veteran analyst, told the Global Times on Monday.Ma said TSMC may also rush orders with more resources tilted toward supplying Huawei, as losing a big customer like Huawei would be ""destructive"" for the Taiwan-based chipmaker. ""However, the orders may only support its chip supply for half a year, as technology evolution in the sector runs fast,"" Ma said.Huawei could still rely on Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) for up to 60 percent of its chip supplies, Han Xiaomin, general manager of Jiwei Consulting in Beijing, told the Global Times.But if the US besieges Huawei, which might involve escalating restrictions on high-end fundamental technologies from the US, China's domestic semiconductor sector and its electronic information industry at large would come under pressure, Han said.It would take five to 10 years for domestic chipmakers to equal the current prowess of US technologies if no progress was made on the US side over the duration, Han said, suggesting that hitting back at the likes of Qualcomm and Apple, a move being considered by the Chinese government first reported by the Global Times, might prompt the affected companies to lobby against the restrictions.In the worst-case scenario, if the US continues its ban and Huawei uses up its chip stock without any domestic substitutes, the company may cut or even sell its high-end consumer devices businesses, and return to its core telecommunications equipment manufacturing, Ma said, adding that the firm will not be defeated given its enormous strength in 5G, though 6G research and development (R&D) may be dragged.Huawei's R&D rhythm, particularly for its future release of high-end consumer devices, will be affected. It needs to be flexible in its business layout and strategy, and make a strategy change according to the changing situation, industry analysts said.The US' move has disrupted the global chip industry chain. Amid an industry reshuffle, some firms will die. Many US firms such as Qualcomm will feel the blow, said Ma.On Friday, TSMC was also reported to have halted new orders from Huawei in response to tighter US export controls aimed at further limiting the Chinese company's access to crucial chip supplies, according to a report from Nikkei Asian Review, citing multiple sources.TSMC said it does not disclose order details, adding that the Nikkei report was ""purely market rumor,"" according to a Reuters report.TSMC had not responded to an interview request from the Global Times as of press time.

"Taiwan separatist lobby try hijacking US policynA Chinese community in Los Angeles calls for reunification and protests Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen making a stopover in the US in August 2018. Photo: cnsphoto Influencing US foreign policy Since the US identified China as its major strategic competitor, separatists of Taiwan island have been taking advantage of the widening rifts to influence US foreign policy. The Taiwan lobby aims to shake the foundation of the China-US relationship and has renewed sway among US politicians in the White House and Congress.The separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of Taiwan has seemingly gained achievements in recent years.US Congress has passed legislation encouraging Taiwan separatism and provoking China's sovereignty. The Taiwan Travel Act, signed by the Trump administration in 2018, allows leaders of Taiwan to travel to the US as all but diplomatic representatives. Passed in March, The Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act calls on international organizations to increase the island's so-called diplomatic scope.Most recently, the White House has made efforts to politicize the World Health Assembly (WHA) by encouraging its allies to support Taiwan to join the assembly without respecting the one-China principle.The DPP and pro-Taiwan independence US politicians might believe they have created many troubles for the Chinese mainland with little cost, and they can even earn benefits from each other without significant punishment from China, but in fact, they are endangering the peace of the West Pacific region experts warned.When China realizes the US completely changed its promise to respect the one-China principle, as well as abandoned its official neutrality on Taiwan affairs, the mainland would probably decide peaceful reunification is unlikely to realize. The mainland will be forced to prepare non-peaceful measure, and at that time, Taiwan separatists and US warmongers will lose, said mainland analysts.Taiwan lobbying in the US can be traced back to the World War II. The Kuomintang regime at the time sent delegations to lobby the US asking for support in the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, and after 1949 when the KMT lost the civil war and retreated to Taiwan, the island's authority also lobbied the US to build a ""joint defense alliance"" against the mainland.When the US established formal diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China in 1979, Taiwan had used its lobby groups to ensure the US passed the Taiwan Relations Act to maintain some connections between the island and the US under table, including arm sales.The bipartisan Congressional Taiwan Caucus is the second largest Congressional Member Organization in the United States Congress with 139 members. The caucus focuses exclusively on improving US ties with the island. Chinese mainland analysts noted that apart from Israeli lobby groups, advocacy groups from Taiwan are likely the ones that spent the most money influencing US foreign policy.Yuan Zheng, a research fellow and expert on Taiwan lobbying activities in the US at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times ""Taiwan has paid a lot of efforts to maintain its ties with US congressional members by inviting them to travel to the island and also building personal relations with their families.""Especially with the conservative Republicans with anti-Communist mentality, the island has found common ideological ground with them. After the island kicked off Western neoliberal democratic reform in the 1980s, the Democrats also found they have political values in common, so even though Taiwan politicians provided material benefits to influence US foreign policy, they would not be criticized in US public opinion due to ideological reasons, Yuan said. US Congress Photos: cnsphoto Money and politics In the US, the Chinese mainland doesn't have such capacity to influence Congress even though it has more money than Taiwan and is more powerful. Due to ideological difference, it would be a ""political suicide"" if any US politician dares to help the mainland, even if it could benefit both sides, Yuan added.The two major political parties of the island all have their own lobby groups in the US. The KMT has held a pro-reunification stance and had deeper connection with the US. The separatist DPP was not considered as trustworthy as the KMT in the 2000s, US worried the DPP's extreme separatism held by the island's then-leader Chen Shui-bian would send the US to unnecessary frictions with the Chinese mainland.""The time has changed. At that time, the Bush administration needed China's support to its Global War on Terror, as the biggest enemy to the US at that time was terrorists, so it will surely try its best to make sure China-US ties were stable and suppress separatists of the island,"" Yuan said.In 2016, according to CNN, the DPP officials hired US senator-turned-lobbyist Bob Dole to set up a controversial phone call between then president-elect Donald Trump and Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen, marking a shift in the US attitude toward cross-Straits relations.""I've never met a member of Congress who says 'I don't support Taiwan issues,'"" said Coen Blaauw, executive director of the Washington-based Taiwan advocacy group Formosan Association for Public Relations, the VOA reported on March 27, 2019 in a report about the Taiwan advocacy groups influencing the quick rising ties between the US and the island.Yuan said although the DPP and the KMT have sponsored and run different lobby groups in the US, they now share common interests, and due to the fact that they have deep ties with local Chinese Americans, they can even help the local US politicians, including senators, run for election.""For instance, Global Taiwan Institute, a new lobby group backed by the DPP, was sponsored by local Chinese American businessmen,"" and they can make Chinese Americans vote, and provide political contribution to US politicians for local elections, so they share a lot of common interests, Yuan said.The power comparison between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits has totally lost balance as the mainland has overwhelming advantage in economy, military, politics and technology, so the US believes that if it just maintains its previous policy, the mainland will soon reunify with Taiwan and Washington will lose its most important card that could effectively provoke and contain the Chinese mainland, said an anonymous Taiwan-based military observer.""So the politicians in both the US and the island will have more excuses and legitimacy to boost arms sales and they can earn more profits from the business,"" he noted.Li Xiaobing, a Taiwan studies expert at Nankai University in Tianjin, said that in fact, the most important reason for Taiwan to influence the US foreign policy is the island's status, which is a key matter the US can exploit to contain the Chinese mainland, and that Taiwan is a major client to US military industrial companies and is willing to spend high prices to buy outdated weapons. ""So the interests are always entangled with corruption under the table."" Chinese demonstrators sing songs and chant slogans while waiting for the arrival of Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen in Los Angeles in August 2018. As Tsai arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel, she was greeted by peaceful Chinese demonstrators of all ages and from all walks of life. They were holding flags, banners and signs bearing the slogan ""One China."" The crowd began chanting ""One China!"" and ""Oppose Taiwan Independence!"" as Tsai pulled into the hotel. Photo: Wang Rujun Dangerous moves The US-based Project 2049 Institute is one of the organizations that frequently receive ""donations"" from Taiwan authorities, the Global Times found. Ian Easton, a research fellow from the institute, published an article in March advocating that ""America should put military forces in Taiwan"" in return for Taiwan island's long-term funding and to cater to the rise of US containment of the Chinese mainland.The Taiwan representative office in the US in 2016 gave the institute $150,000 in funding, while the Taiwan ""defense department"" also donated about $130,000. Additionally, the Prospect Foundation, a think tank in Taiwan focused on security, donated $60,000-70,000 to the Project 2049 Institute.If Taiwan lobby groups and US politicians keep moving in this direction, the possibility of a peaceful reunification by the mainland will decline sharply, and this is truly dangerous for them, Li said.Lü Xiang, a research fellow on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, said that the US has no capability to protect Taiwan once the separatists cross the red line, since the mainland now has the overwhelming military advantage to solve this long-standing problem, therefore ""the more tricks they play to challenge our principle, the nearer we get to reunification.""However, the DPP and other separatists of the island don't really believe the mainland dares to solve the Taiwan question by force as they believe the mainland is preoccupied by other problems, Yuan said.""They might push something like an illegal 'independence referendum' to challenge the Chinese mainland's bottom line, and if the US made no effort to suppress these dangerous attempts, the mainland might have no choice but to respond with ultimate measures,"" said Jin Canrong, associate dean of Renmin University of China's School of International Studies in Beijing.

"Taiwan’s infamous ‘dollar diplomacy’ fails to buy friends or respect: expertsnA Chinese community in Los Angeles calls for reunification and protests Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen making a stopover in the US in August 2018. Photo: cnsphoto The attempt of Taiwan authority to buy recognition from international community with masks amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, like its traditional means of pleasing its ""allies"" with huge amounts of money, has brought the island nothing but embarrassment. Taiwan's money diplomacy seems unable to stop its allies from leaving, as keeping so-called diplomatic relation with Taiwan did not conform to most countries' long-term strategy and interests, analysts said.Tsai Ing-wen's authority claimed last month to donate 10 million face masks to some Western countries it regards as political ""allies,"" despite its own mask shortage and well-maligned decision to halt mask exports to the Chinese mainland.But their pretended generosity, serving political interests of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), has unsurprisingly got cold shoulders of many recipients, if we remembered how Paraguay, one of its ""allies,"" reportedly grumbled the 100,000 masks Taiwan had donated were not enough. Paraguay eventually appealed to the Chinese mainland for help.Ho Ching, wife of Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, displayed an apparent lack of enthusiasm to Taiwan's belated mask donation on her social media, though the first lady later updated a ""thank you"" post under the pressure.Taiwan had issued a ban on the export of surgical face masks and consequently struck a deal for two surgical mask production lines Singapore set up in Taiwan. Taiwan's trick prompted many Singaporean netizens to comment across social media with ""Erm, thanks, but no thanks.""Tsai's ""mask diplomacy"" in the pandemic is just a tool that local authority utilizes to satisfy its own vanity, seeking for a feeling as if it is ""important and welcomed to international community,"" said Ni Yongjie, deputy director of the Shanghai Institute of Taiwan Studies.""But in fact, the 'mask diplomacy' is just another self-deceiving attempt of DPP as the international society has seldom taken its voice seriously,"" Ni told the Global Times.History has proved that the Taiwan authority's attempt of fawning over its ""allies"" and gaining respect through ""donation diplomacy"" is no more than wishful thinking. Seven countries have abandoned Taipei and turned to establish diplomatic relations with Beijing after DPP took office in 2016.The Solomon Islands announced to break ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan in September 2019.Facing pressure of economic slowdown in recent years, Taiwan has been nonetheless spending as much as $322.63 million in aiding its then ""allies"" in the Pacific region from 2011 to 2017, according the Pacific Aid Map made by Australia-based Lowy Institute.Ironically, the paying out didn't work.""The US has offered Taipei few actual helps but pies in the sky, and even that has coaxed Taipei to be self-satisfied and compliant,"" Ni said.""Money can buy Taiwan neither 'friendship' nor respect,"" Ni said.Observers predicted that the number of Taiwan's ""allies"" will decrease to fewer than 10 within two or three years and will eventually drop to zero.

"Mired in uproar and panic, Taiwan's DPP a clown in their self-directed political soap opera: expertsnFile Photo: Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council. Photo:Xinhua Mainland analysts warned Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities on the island of Taiwan not to step any further of declaring independence amid the pandemic, as both the mainland's deterrence and US' purported sincerity are rattling the island's ruling party.The warnings ensued after a DPP legislator withdrew a proposal to remove the mention of the reunification of China as the ""national aim,"" from the ""Act Governing Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.""Tsai Yi-yu, the DPP legislator who proposed the move recently, said the withdrawal was due to safety concerns of the island and destabilizing Cross-Straits relations , especially before May 20, the ""presidential inauguration"" of Tsai Ing-wen, media from the island reported.Several people from the island will realize that it is only a pawn of the US to make the mainland uncomfortable, as the DPP authorities are incapable of competing with the mainland, Yang Lixian, a research fellow at the Beijing-based research center of cross-Straits relations, told the Global Times on Saturday.Yang noted that pro-secessionist moves would never succeed. Taiwan will face a massive economic blow when ECFA stops without extension this year. Chinese People's Liberation Army's recent drills have already sparked discussion of taking over Dongsha islands, which is controlled by Taiwan, in the South China Sea. Since Tsai Ing-wen took over the reins of the island, seven countries have cut off ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan.The Trump government is in hot water due to its botched anti-pandemic efforts and domestic economic crisis; therefore, they will not break up with the mainland over the Taiwan question, analysts said.How can these US politicians help secessionism when they don't even have any real powers to help Taiwan participate in the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer, questioned Yang.Xu Xue, a professor on Taiwan issues with the Institute of Taiwan at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Saturday that DPP authority should not dare to declare independence, and the withdrawal of the proposal showed their panic when more people are aware of US' unreliability.According to Xu, the proposal and its withdrawal are just like a political show by clowns, which hardly affects the mainland's direction but only deceiving Taiwan residences.Compared to the political soap opera directed by the DPP, the mainland cares much more about China-US relations and the understanding and support of Taiwan residents, said Xu.Taiwan secessionists have misread situations and repeatedly challenged the bottom line of the mainland, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, commented after DPP legislators proposed to remove the mention of the reunification of China.DPP's acts are extremely dangerous. No one should underestimate the will and determination of 1.4 billion Chinese people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, he added. "	5/16/20	0	0	-0.615	-1
"Taiwan compatriots protest US' China-bashing campaign, seek apologynTaiwan residents protest against the US with banners on Thursday. Photo: Courtesy of Chou Ching-Chuen A group of Taiwan compatriots protested against the US for slamming China on the novel coronavirus and its groundless accusation of the Chinese government's mishandling of the COVID19, as they gathered at the American Institute in Taiwan to announce their condemnation on Thursday.Initiated by the Taipei-based Chinese Patriotic Concentric Association, a group of Taiwan residents declared their support to Wuhan lawyer Liang Xuguang who filed a lawsuit against the US over its slander towards China and its opaque handling of the coronavirus cases in the earlier days of the outbreak.The group denounced the US ""China-bashing"" campaign as a lame trick by some politicians, with some banners reading, ""China is never producer of the virus but rather a victim of it"" or ""Unscrupulous US politicians owe China an apology and should return China justice.""They delivered the legal complaint drafted by Wuhan-based lawyer Liang Xuguang, who urged the US to stop spreading misinformation and to publicize the number of ""influenza deaths"" caused by novel coronavirus in the earlier days, to the American Institute in Taiwan.""We refute the US' political attempts to cast blame on China and to smear the Chinese people,"" said Zhang Xiuye, a participator of the protest. ""Today's China is no longer the weak one 100 years ago, whereas the US is no longer the one in its heyday. We urge US politicians not to bully the Chinese with their hegemonic mentality.""""The virus origin is a scientific issue that the US politicians should not overly meddle in. Trump is an incompetent ruler who has only the ability to instigate conflicts and scapegoat others for his own inability to control the outbreak, but never has the ability to give any effective measures amid the severe epidemic condition,"" she added.""Trump fantasizes himself as the savior of Taiwan island. In fact, any wise Taiwan compatriot is aware that the US does not really take Taiwan's interests into consideration but utilizes the island only as a political tool. It is the right time for the US to get out of the land,"" Chou Ching-Chuen, the president of Chinese Patriotic Concentric Association, told the Global Times on Thursday. "	5/15/20	0	1	-0.9623	-1
"PLA kicks off drills on northern coastnA missile is launched during the PLA air force's ""Blue Shield-17S"" drill competition on October 28, 2017. Photo: 81.cn China on Thursday kicked off a two-and-a-half month series of military exercises on the northern coast. The drills are more likely to be a regular period of internal training aimed at boosting the combat ability of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and putting its advanced air defense weapons to the test, rather than targeting the island of Taiwan as some reports by Taiwan media have suggested, analysts said.From Thursday to July 31, live-fire shooting will be conducted in the northeastern sea areas off Tangshan, North China's Hebei Province, read a navigation restriction notice the Maritime Safety Administration released on its website on Monday.According to the coordinates and descriptions provided in the notice, the restricted zone is a fan-shaped area with a radius of 25 kilometers, about 525 square kilometers in total, covering some coastal land areas but mostly sea areas.All unrelated vessels and personnel should stop all activity in this area during this period and evacuate to safe zones in advance to avoid accidents, the notice said.The Chinese military has not announced any details of the drills, and speculation soon arose over the exercises, which have an extended duration.Taiwan media outlet EBC News on Wednesday related the drills to Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen's scheduled inauguration speech on May 20, which is only one week away.Some reports claimed the drills could feature landing exercises with the aim of enhancing the ability of the PLA to reunify the island by force.China Central Television (CCTV) military program Weihutang reported on Tuesday that the exercises are being held in the Bohai Bay, the maritime gateway to the nation's capital Beijing, and a strategically important location to protect Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei.The PLA has previously held multiple ""Blue Shield"" series air defense exercises in this region, during which it tested the technical and tactical capabilities of some new types of air defense missiles, Weihutang reported.The Bohai Bay is also one of China's naval weapon test zones, and a training base for aircraft carrier-based fighter jets is located nearby, Weihutang noted.Judging from the location, time and area, the drills are likely regular and internal exercises of the PLA, Xu Guangyu, a senior adviser to the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told the Global Times on Thursday.If the PLA wanted to send a warning to Taiwan secessionists, the drills would not be held in an inland sea area like the Bohai Bay, but would be conducted in the Huanghai Sea, East China Sea or South China Sea, which are nearer to Taiwan, Xu said, noting that the drill zone is not that large and the extended period may indicate tests of new weapons.Tests of large weapons like the JL-3 submarine-launched ballistic missile are also unlikely, because the location is too near to land, analysts said.Taiwan secessionists knew they were doing wrong and had a guilty conscience, so they actively related the drills to themselves, a military expert who asked not to be identified told the Global Times on Thursday.They should always fear the PLA because it has the capability and determination to solve the Taiwan question by force at any time as necessary, regardless of whether it is holding these specific drills to warn them, the expert said.

"Rumored PLA drills plan on Dongsha Islands sparks fear in TaiwannMarines assigned to a brigade of the PLA Navy Marine Corps move forward for assault after disembarking from their amphibious armored vehicle during a beach raid training exercise in the west of south China's Guangdong Province on August 17, 2019. (Photo: eng.chinamil.com.cn) Japanese media on Tuesday claimed in a report that the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) will hold military drills for a ""takeover of Dongsha Islands occupied by Taiwan"" in August, resulting in heated discussions on the island of Taiwan. While the Taiwan defense authority claimed they could secure the Dongsha Islands, experts in Taiwan speculate the PLA is aiming to open a passage for aircraft carriers into the Pacific Ocean and prepare for the establishment of an air defense identification zone in the South China Sea.Chinese mainland experts said on Wednesday that the Dongsha Islands are a strategically important location, and the PLA can turn any exercise into action if Taiwan secessionists insist on secession.The PLA is planning to hold large-scale landing drills in the South China Sea near Hainan Island in August with the imaginary goal of ""taking over the Dongsha Islands occupied by Taiwan,"" Japanese media outlet Kyodo News reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources.According to the report, the PLA Southern Theater Command will dispatch landing ships, hovercraft, helicopters and Marine Corps in this exercise of unprecedented scale.The Chinese side has not announced the drills.The Dongsha Islands are located in the route from PLA naval bases in Hainan Island to Pacific Ocean via the Bashi Channel in the south of Taiwan Island, making it strategically important to the PLA's entry to the Pacific Ocean, Kyodo News said, noting that the US has been frequently sending spy aircraft to the Dongsha Islands, and the PLA drills could add more tensions to China-US relations and cross-Straits relations. File photo shows a Chinese H-6K bomber patrolling islands and reefs including Huangyan Dao in the South China Sea. Photo: Xinhua The Taiwan defense authority has paid extra attention to the report, as its spokesperson Shih Shun-wen was quick to say on Tuesday that the Taiwan military can fully grasp and deal with situations nearby. Lin Wen-huang, Chief of Joint Operations at Taiwan's defense authority, said they have preparations and can protect the islands.Scholars in the island of Taiwan said the drills area partially coincide with the rumored Chinese mainland air defense identification zone in the South China Sea, and the drills could be a preparation for its establishment.Taiwan's military is also planning to make more arms purchases from the US. To deal with ""increasing PLA threats,"" Taiwan's air force is said to be planning to buy four MQ-9 Reaper drones, Taiwan media reported on Wednesday.Chinese mainland military expert Song Zhongping told the Global Times that the Dongsha Islands are a strategically important location in the southeastern coast of China and connects the South China Sea and Western Pacific Ocean. If Taiwan authorities lease the Dongsha Islands to the US military for them to deploy intelligence-gathering or anti-submarine equipment, this could be dangerous to the PLA.The reason behind the increasing tensions in the Taiwan Straits is the Tsai Ing-wen authorities' increasing secession activities, Song said, noting that under this condition, the PLA will need to prepare for a military struggle, including holding joint exercises, to warn Taiwan secessionists not to cross the red line.""Landing missions have been regular training subjects of the PLA. Island takeover trainings like these are literally aimed at islands, like the Dongsha Islands, Penghu Islands and the larger island, namely Taiwan Island. If Taiwan secessionists insist on secession, military exercises can turn into action any time,"" Song said. "	5/13/20	0	0	-0.584	-1
"US bill won’t help Taiwan attend WHAnA citizen runs in front of the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan, on Oct. 1, 2019. (Xinhua/Chen Bin) The reason why China firmly prohibits separatist Taiwan authority from participating in the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer is due to the fact such authority has abandoned the one-China principle, and no matter how the US politicians and their allies exploit the issue to encourage Taiwan separatism, the only consequence that may ensue is the mainland considering ending this senseless game by solving the Taiwan question once and for all via non-peaceful means.The US Senate on Monday passed a bill that requests Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to design a strategy to ""help Taiwan regain observer status"" at the WHA, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), to be held on May 17.Chinese analysts said that in fact, since 2017 when the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took power ruling the island, Western politicians, especially US lawmakers and officials, who received funding from the DPP played such games every year ahead of annual WHAs, and they failed every time, and there will be no difference this year, even as the COVID-19 pandemic is becoming a new excuse for them to exaggerate the issue further.The bill was drafted by Republican Senator Jim Inhofe and Democrat Senator Bob Menendez who co-chairs the Senate's Taiwan Caucus.The Senate's Taiwan Caucus with 24 senators focuses exclusively on improving connections between the US and the island. It's counterpart in the House is the bipartisan Congressional Taiwan Caucus, which is the second largest Congressional Member Organization in the House with 139 members. Li Xiaobing, a Taiwan studies expert at Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times on Tuesday that ""US congressional members of the caucus have been using the legislature of their country to support Taiwan separatism for a very long time since the Taiwan separatist authorities donate huge amount of money for this service every year. Now these politicians are aiming at a dangerous strategic goal to challenge the one-China policy.""Such US politicians have never cared about public health affairs or international cooperation on fighting the pandemic at all, and according to the statement they made, everyone with common sense can see how ignorant they are, while just using their legislative power in the US to earn Taiwan's money easily, Li said.When announcing on his website the passage of the bill, Inhofe wrote that ""Taiwan has been a strong partner in public health, donating countless medical supplies around the world, including to the United States, and has been a leader in treatment, research and information sharing."" He also stigmatized the Chinese mainland with some groundless accusations.Lü Xiang, a research fellow on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday that ""It seems this senator is living in a world different than the rest of us. We are not belittling the island's efforts to deal with the outbreak, but it's a well-known fact across the world that the Chinese mainland has not only sent professional teams to help other countries, but also acting as the logistical center for the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.""The game that the US has played to help Taiwan regain WHA observer status has nothing to do with information sharing or other public health issues, but only aims to serve the US political and strategic purpose of containing China, said experts.Taiwan's normal technical cooperation and communication on the epidemic prevention with the WHO and the mainland has never been impacted even it cannot attend the WHA as an observer. Since 2019, 16 groups of Taiwan public health experts had participated in WHO activities on technical issue under the one-China principle, said Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson of Chinese Foreign Ministry on Tuesday.The earliest warning message regarding Wuhan's outbreak that Taiwan received in January is from the mainland's public health authorities, and the shameless separatist authorities even claimed it was Taiwan who spotted the outbreak, however in truth they just transmitted the message from the mainland directly to the WHO, said Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the State Council of the Taiwan Affairs Office on April 17.""The masks and ventilators that the US received from the mainland were of a much higher standard than they could get from Taiwan. How dare these ignorant and senseless US politicians speak such nonsense which is obviously against the facts?"" Li noted.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said on April 23 via her Twitter account that ""As of April 20, China had provided the US with over 2.46 billion masks, equaling 7 masks for every person in the US,"" and ""nearly 5,000 ventilators"" and many other medical materials.US senior officials are very reluctant to appreciate China's efforts, while they flattered Taiwan, even as the island announced previously they could only provide 10 million masks to other nations, and the US could get 2 million of these, according to Taiwan media reports.China's efforts to help other countries have won praises from the WHO and many members among the international community, including many Western countries like Italy and Spain, so it doesn't worry about the tricks that the Taiwan separatist authority and the US would play at all.Because the international community is very clear about who is really contributing to the global fight against the pandemic and who is politicizing the pandemic to serve its own strategic goals, said the Chinese mainland experts. Photo taken on Jan. 30, 2020 shows the headquarters of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland.(Xinhua/Chen Junxia) The DPP authority's image in the mainland is horrible. This is not only because of its separatist stance, but also due to its hostile and non-humanitarian policies against mainlanders. For instance, the island banned mask exports to the mainland from January, when the outbreak was at its worst, but it donated masks to the US, even though one person on the island is only allowed to buy nine masks in two weeks.The international community and the WHO understand the issue regarding Taiwan has no relevance to public health affairs, especially about handling the pandemic. The US and its allies, not WHO members, would like to see international cooperation be interrupted any political issue, analysts said. The US can't even get full support from the G7 to criticize the WHO.""The firm attitude that the mainland holds against DPP authorities is based on anger among the public on the mainland, and there is no room for any kind of Taiwan separatism in the international multilateral sphere. The DPP should better understand, if it wants Taiwan to return to the WHA as an observer, it should talk to Beijing instead of Washington. The one-China principle is the only key,"" Li said.Although China has enough influence and international support to safeguard its sovereignty in the WHO, the US and its allies could possibly take advantage of certain tricks to break the rules of the organization and unilaterally put Taiwan's representatives into the assembly, mainland analysts noted.""That could paralyze the WHA and even force other members to deal with debates that have nothing to do with the pandemic. The rattling of the one-China principle would bring diplomatic and political struggles between major powers, and this would seriously interrupt public health affairs, which should be the theme of the assembly, and this is a dangerous precedent and highly irresponsible move by the US,"" Li said.China won't be affected too much by the tricks that the US and its allies try to play, and the only possible consequence for the island and the US is that the people of the mainland lose their faith in peaceful reunification, and more people would urge mainland decision-makers to solve the Taiwan question via non-peaceful means, so the mainland could stop the US from using the island as card to contain China once and for all, mainland experts noted.Lü said that the US has no capability to protect Taiwan once the separatists cross the red line, since the mainland now has the overwhelming advantage to solve this long-standing problem, therefore ""the more tricks they play to challenge our principle, the nearer we get to reunification.""

"Taiwan island will fall flat as US puppet: Global Times editorialnPhoto taken on January 30, 2020 shows the headquarters of the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. Photo: Xinhua The island of Taiwan is campaigning furiously to attend the World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting to be held from May 18 to 19. However, the situation does not favor it.Eight countries, including the US, jointly penned a letter to the World Health Organization (WHO) saying its director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, can invite Taiwan as an observer to the WHA. However, the WHO responded explicitly that the director-general doesn't have the power to do so without the support of all WHO member states.Thirteen of Taiwan's ""diplomatic"" allies have called for an invitation to the island. But the WHO has 194 member states. The US should have known that the number of countries supporting the island as an observer is far from sufficient, so it just rallied some allies to pen a letter to not let the ""Taipei Act"" down.The Chinese central government has criticized island of Taiwan's move as using the ongoing coronavirus pandemic to seek ""independence."" There are many ways that the island can share its anti-virus experience, if any, with the rest of the world. The Chinese mainland has never interfered in Taiwan's technological exchanges with the WHO.Under the rule of Ma Ying-jeou, Taiwan joined the WHA meeting as an observer under the title of ""Chinese Taipei."" At that time, the 1992 Consensus was endorsed across the Straits, and one China was ensured. But Tsai Ing-wen authorities refuse to admit the 1992 Consensus and their intention to participate in the WHA meetings is politically driven. They will by no means be given the chance.As Washington is determined to use the Taiwan card to target Beijing, more US-provoked troubles regarding the island can be anticipated. The US has the strength and international mobilization ability to create waves. China should adopt different approaches and strengths to rival the US in this regard.What works for China is that the one-China principle has been universally acknowledged and is one of the foundations of the existing international order. Sticking to this principle is sticking to rules and morality.As for the US, its leverage lies in three aspects. First, the authorities of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan collude with the US; second, the US and its Western allies control the international discourse power; and third, with its strength, the US can coerce some countries to make them act in favor of the island of Taiwan.If the US agitates the Taiwan Straits with current tactics, it will have a limited impact on the one-China structure. But if it plays the Taiwan card with real actions, China may be propelled to strike back at whatever cost.Taiwan is a focal point of China-US rivalry that poses challenges to the two major world powers. It is important that Chinese society supports any action that China takes to safeguard its sovereignty. Yet, it is unrealistic to expect China to win in each round.The Chinese mainland's ability to resolve the Taiwan question via military means is becoming mature. Its comprehensive strength to cope with changes surrounding the question is also increasing. This is the foremost change in the situation vis-à-vis the Taiwan Straits. It is Beijing that tightly steers the wheel of the Taiwan Straits.Taiwan's so-called independent diplomacy has met its demise. The island is trying to return to the international stage as a US puppet, but it could only see mirages. Unless DPP authorities could move the island into the Caribbean Sea, its free ride of the US will eventually make it fall. "	5/12/20	0	0	0.9934	1

"China urges New Zealand to discard illusions and stop wrong commentary on Taiwan island-related issuesnPhoto taken on July 21, 2019 from Xiangshan Mountain shows the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan.Photo:Xinhua China urged New Zealand to strictly abide by the one-China principle, and immediately stop wrong commentary and misdeeds on Taiwan island-related issues, so as not to damage China-New Zealand relations, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday.Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian made the remarks during a routine press conference on Monday, commenting on reports that New Zealand's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Winston Peters said that the country formally supports Taiwan's case to join the World Health Assembly as an observer.Wrongful commentary made by New Zealand has severely violated the one-China principle, and China has expressed strong opposition and lodged solemn representations to New Zealand, Zhao said.Handling of Taiwan region's participation in World Health Organization (WHO）activities must follow the one-China principle, which is the clear and consistent position of China regarding the matter, Zhao said.The Chinese Central Government has made proper arrangements for the region's participation in global health affairs, to ensure that Taiwan is able to respond to a public health event whether it's on the island or globally, in a timely and effective fashion, Zhao said.""Taiwan authorities"" are seeking separatism using the pandemic, which is a purely political maneuver, Zhao said, commenting on Taiwan's recent hype-up of its participation in WHO activities and re-joining the WHA.Zhao stressed that the one-China principle is the political cornerstone of China-New Zealand relations, and a basic guarantee for the rapid development of bilateral relations since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.Peters is also reported to have attained ""promises"" from Chinese high-level officials that New Zealand would not be met with obstacles.Zhao said that he had no clue how Peters came up with such an illusion.No one should have any illusions on matters related to China's core interests. It is hoped that the involved personnel from New Zealand stop spreading rumors and creating chaos, and do things beneficial to mutual trust and cooperation between the two countries, rather than the other way around.

"Change in Netherlands' office name in Taiwan is “playing with fire,” poses risk to ties with Chinese mainland: expertsnPhoto taken on July 21, 2019 from Xiangshan Mountain shows the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan.Photo:Xinhua The Netherlands took down a video clip in which it changed the trade and investment in Taiwan to the Netherlands office Taipei a day after the video was released. Chinese experts warned that the country's move is ""playing with fire"" and poses a risk to ties with the Chi-nese mainland.The Netherlands trade and investment office in Taiwan island confirmed on Thursday that it had taken down a video in which it announced the office's name being changed from the previous ""Netherlands Trade and Investment Office"" to the ""Netherlands Office Taipei.""""By taking out the words 'trade and invest-ment,' we have become more inclusive of all the other areas we are collaborating with. So clearly, less here is much more,"" Guy Wittich, the head of the office, had said in the video.However, the video was taken down one day after it was released. ""The video was always meant to be available only for one day so it can be watched and serve its original pur-pose,"" the office was cited by Taipei-based CNA as saying.Renaming the ""Netherlands Trade and Invest-ment Office"" may imply the country's intention to seek cooperation with the Taiwan island beyond ""trade"" to fields of ""diplomacy"" or ""na-tional security,"" which is a provocative move to the Chinese mainland. The Netherlands, at the same time, lowered the recognition of Taiwan island to ""Taipei"" in this name changing game, experts noted.Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, told the Global Times on Friday that ""the Netherlands tries to please both the Chi-nese mainland and Taiwan island in this game, but it is playing with fire and puts relations with the Chinese mainland at risk.""Unlike the US, which frequently aggressively provokes the Taiwan question, the Nether-lands would not dare to have such a bold move of challenging the Chinese mainland. Their little trick is crystal clear for the Chinese mainland and should be condemned, Xin said, calling on the Netherlands to give an explana-tion.Despite that the video clip that boasted the ties between the Taiwan island and the Neth-erlands was only available online for one day, the Taiwan authorities could not help showing their glee at this minor benefit offered by the Netherlands. The incident was also taken as a stunt by the Taiwan authorities to fool Taiwan people, which was only ""self-deceive and hi-larious,"" Xin said.Xin said Taiwan authorities only have to look for self-presence in the international commu-nity from this little wording game as its so-called diplomatic presence continues to shrink since Tsai Ing-wen became the leader.Taiwan was left with ""diplomatic ties"" with only 15 countries around the world.The Netherlands' move may trigger similar dangerous moves from other European coun-tries they may step into the grey area to chal-lenge the one-China principle, which is entire-ly unacceptable, Xin noted.The Chinese Embassy in the Netherlands pre-viously requested clarification of the matter. The embassy stressed that the Taiwan ques-tion concerns China's core interests, and ad-hering to the one-China principle is the politi-cal foundation for developing China-Netherlands relations.Chinese netizens irritated by the Netherlands' move called on the Chinese companies to immediately stop exporting medical supplies to the country, and appealed to others to boycott all Dutch products and cancel their travel plans to the country.

"Taiwan made huge 'donations' to the US to promote passage of 'Taipei Act': sourcenTourists view the Taipei 101 skyscraper, a landmark in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan, Jan. 2, 2017. (Xinhua/Zhu Xiang) Taiwan authorities made huge ""donations"" to the US in order to promote the passage of the ""Taipei Act,"" which aims to prop up the presence of Taiwan island through measures including a large number of arms purchase rebates and budgets involving millions of tax-free allowances.US President Donald Trump signed into law the ""Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative Act of 2019"" on March 26 under which the US government is legitimately seeking to establish a diplomatic presence for the island and help Taiwan island gain participation in international organizations as well as level up its economic ties with the island.The Chinese Foreign Ministry and Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council opposed and condemned the bill, saying it interferes in China's internal affairs and seriously violates the one-China principle and provisions of the three joint communiques between China and the US.A source told the Global Times that to achieve its goal of passing the act in the US, Taiwan authorities had paid huge amounts of money in the form of ""donations"" to experts and scholars recommended by US Congress members through several educational research institutes such as the ""Taiwan Institute of Economic Development"" and ""Taiwan Research Institute.""The US and Taiwan island also designated former White House Chief Strategist Stephen Bannon and former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator Hsiao Bi-khim as their contacts to operate and promote the passage of the bill, the Global Times learned from the source.The US-based ""Project 2049 Institute"" is one of the popular organizations that frequently receives ""donations"" from Taiwan authorities, the Global Times found. Ian Easton, a research fellow from the Project 2049 Institute, had published an article in March advocating ""America should put military forces in Taiwan"" in return for Taiwan island's long-term funding and to cater to the rise of the US to contain China.When the Project 2049 Institute was first established, Hsiao was an advisor and her relationship with the institute goes beyond the norm, Taiwan-based EAT News revealed.Since Tsai Ing-wen took office in 2016 and the DPP came to power, Taiwan's economic and cultural representative office in the US and its defense department have ""donated"" $350,000 to $500,000 to the institute, far more than funding from the US government.Specifically, the Taiwan representative office in the US gave the institute in 2016 $150,000 in funding, while the Taiwan ""defense department"" also donated about $130,000. Additionally, the Prospect Foundation, a think tank in Taiwan focused on security, donated the considerable amount of $60,000-70,000 to the Project 2049 Institute.Previously, US magazine The Nation had also revealed that Taiwan authorities had made a $550,000 contribution to the American Enterprise Institute, one of the most powerful conservative think tanks in Washington, through Taiwan's economic and cultural representative office in the US in 2019.Scholars from the think tank later published several articles in diplomatic journals, urging the US government to sell weapons to Taiwan island.

"China rejects Aussie ‘economic coercion’ claimnForeign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang (Photo from Foreign Ministry website) The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has dismissed claims that China is using ""economic coercion"" against Australia after Australia called for an independent review into the origins and spread of COVID-19, which the Chinese Ambassador said could trigger Chinese public dissatisfaction.The ambassador is talking about the concerns that some wrong remarks from the Australian side have caused dissatisfaction among the Chinese people, which could have a possible impact on bilateral relations. Where does the so-called 'economic coercion' come from?"" Geng Shuang, the spokesperson of the ministry, said at the Tuesday press conference.The response came after Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said that Australia rejects economic coercion threats from China, referring to Chinese ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye's remarks that the Chinese public could avoid Australian products and universities in response to Australia's push for an investigation into the coronavirus pandemic.Chinese Ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye said in an interview on Monday that ""the tourists may have second thoughts. Maybe the parents of the students would also think whether this place, which they find is not so friendly, even hostile, is the best place to send their kids to.""""Maybe the ordinary people will think why they should drink Australian wine or eat Australian beef,"" Cheng said.As the pandemic undermined the global economy, China is willing to strengthen cooperation with other countries to overcome difficulties, and contribute to the health and well-being of mankind, Geng said, adding that China hopes other countries will avoid being two-faced.Chen Hong, a professor, and director of Australian Studies Center at East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the so-called economic coercion was more like a joke when it is Australia, not China, which has been provoking decoupling from China economically and diversifying its exports in recent years, but now it's criticizing China for resorting to economic coercion.What the Chinese ambassador said reflected the ordinary Chinese people's feelings toward Australia as it has spearheaded the anti-China campaign for quite a long time, Chen said.""Even my students asked me whether it's safe to travel to Australia at this moment when Chinese and Asian people were increasingly targeted by racism and anti-China sentiment in the country,"" Chen said.Also, Geng criticized Australian media as failing to understand China and the Chinese public comprehensively and thoroughly, in response to an Australian reporter who said he had not heard of Chinese people's dissatisfaction with his country.""Did you not hear any of it? Do you want to listen to it? Please check China's Internet to see what Chinese people say about China-Australia relations,"" Geng said.As the reporter questioned the truth of comments on Chinese social media, Geng replied by asking, ""Why do you think Chinese people's comments on the Internet are untrue? Then who wrote those remarks? Robots? If you didn't hear it in the real world, it means you haven't reached far enough into Chinese society.""It's normal for Chinese people to have these concerns and dissatisfactions, and even when they chose to boycott Australian products and tourism, it's just typical consumers' behaviors instead of economic coercion, Chen said.""Australian beef and wine, tourism and studying are all replaceable, and Chinese consumers can independently turn to other alternatives,"" Chen said.Australia's anti-China campaign will continue to worsen the bilateral relations after the coronavirus pandemic, which will eventually affect the economic ties of the two countries. And ultimately, the Australian people and its economy, which relies heavily on exports, will suffer, Chen said.According to Reuters, Australia last week called for all members of the World Health Organization to support an independent review into the origins and spread of the coronavirus, and is lobbying world leaders to this end.On Monday, Ambassador Cheng Jingye took a phone call from Frances Adamson, Secretary of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.The spokesperson of Chinese Embassy in Australia said that during the phone call, Secretary Adamson tried her best to defend Australia's proposal for the independent review, saying it had no political motive nor was it targeting China. The spokesperson highlighted the content of their conversation, saying Adamson ""also admitted that now is not the time to commence the review and Australia has no details of the proposal.""According to the spokesperson, Cheng clearly explained China's position, stressing that no matter what excuses the Australian side makes, the fact cannot be buried that the proposal for an independent review is a political maneuver. ""Just as a Western saying goes: Cry up wine and sell vinegar.""Cheng rejected the concerns expressed from the Australian side over his remarks in a recent interview with the Australian Financial Review, and called on Australia to put aside ideological bias, stop political games and do more to promote bilateral relations.

"China-US medical ties immune to decoupling talk amid pandemicnFile Photo Hawkish US politicians continue to push for China-US decoupling to reduce the interdependency of the two major powers due to their hostility against China. Still, the cooperation in the fight against COVID-19 between China and US scientists has not been impacted, and experts of China-US relationship in the two countries also urged that the trade ties should not be decoupled as the less interdependency, the more risks of strategic conflicts.Scientists from China and the US are teaming up to investigate the origin of COVID-19, despite US conservative politicians groundlessly accuse China for failing to cooperate with the outside world to stem the disease. The cooperation with US counterparts, which is based on the scientific spirit, has not been impacted by the political campaign against China launched by the Trump administration, a Chinese scientist on epidemiology said.Lu Jiahai, vice dean of the Public Health School of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, told the Global Times on Tuesday that his team which specializes in Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) has already cooperated with US scientists of Columbia University since 2018 to track different types of EIDs. Their cooperation to trace the origin of COVID-19 started in early February.Ian Lipkin, Lu's partner in the US and director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, told the Financial Times that he was working with Lu's team to determine whether the coronavirus emerged in other parts of China before it was first discovered in Wuhan in December.The effort relies on help from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, FT reported on Monday.Most EIDs come from animals, and there is a consensus of scientists that COVID-19 came from a bat. But how animal-to-human transmission happened remains a question, and we are trying to determine whether there was an intermediate host between bats and humans, Lu said. ""We will conduct the investigation in China, and Prof. Lipkin will do the same work in the US.""""The China CDC is interested in learning as much as it can about the origins [of] these types of viruses,"" Lipkin, who is also a virologist who worked on the 2003 SARS and 2012 MERS coronavirus outbreak, told FT. ""We share whatever we learn with the entire scientific community.""Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the Global Times that the US has found deaths from the COVID-19 in early February, and there could be more patients or deaths from the virus even in January and December last year. So international cooperation to trace the origin is necessary.The work of Chinese and American scientists has not been impacted by the politicizing and blame-shifting in the US against China so far . But China-US trade relations are in danger as Washington hawks are trying to decouple the bilateral ties and weaken the interdependency of the two countries.Many US hawks are now calling for ending or heavily limiting trade with China after the coronavirus crisis subsides. The Washington Post reported on Friday that leading Republicans, including Senator Lindsey Graham, are demanding that China pay financially for what they allege was ""a cover-up of the lethal coronavirus outbreak that ultimately brought the US economy to a near halt, erasing more than 26 million American jobs and costing the federal government trillions of dollars in emergency spending.""""Key lawmakers want US President Donald Trump to cancel the $1 trillion-plus US debt to China and to push companies to relocate their medical product supply chains to the US,"" the post reported.But reasonable and calm voices remain in the US, warning that decoupling would be dangerous and unrealistic. They said the two major world powers should continue to work together despite increasing competition. These include renowned political scholars Ezra Vogel and Joseph Nye of Harvard University.Nye, a former Dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, said that ""the US and China developed good cooperation after the SARS epidemic, and we should restore and enhance that with cooperative scientific-medical projects.""Even if the pandemic has slowed economic globalization, ecological globalization will continue. It is driven by changes in the technology of transportation and communication which will not stop, he said in an exclusive interview with the Global Times on Sunday.Vogel, a Professor Emeritus at Harvard, told the Global Times in January that ""the general public doesn't know enough about the China-US decoupling, and they are worried about it. But for those who are informed, we believe decoupling is impossible. In some cases, the two countries may decouple, but the decoupling will not take place in a significant way.""""China and the US are in the same boat, so we must work together,"" he stressed.The Washington Examiner also said in an opinion piece on Saturday that while free trade isn't realistic given the reality of the US' ""adversarial relationship with China,"" to embrace such extreme economic nationalism and protectionism would harm low-income people the most.Clark Packard, the Trade Policy Counsel of R Street Institute, a Washington-based think tank, stressed that protectionist policies against China would hurt the working class and lower-income consumers the most, the Washington Examiner reported.""[American businesses] would lose a significant customer base if we eliminated trade with China,"" Packard warned. ""And American consumers would see prices increase.""""Countries that have trade and investment ties are less likely to go to war,"" Packard explained. ""So, we should be skeptical of the hawks in the US saying it will make the US safer if we cut trade from China. I think history has proven that to be exactly the wrong idea.""Although there are diverse opinions on China among US elites, rational voices have a limited influence in the White House, Chinese experts warned.Jin Canrong, the associate dean of Renmin University of China's School of International Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday that ""although China has no intention to decouple from the US, it is hard for us to stop the US side from doing so because the Trump administration is dominated by nationalists and populists with an anti-China mindset.""What China can do is to maintain and reinforce cooperation with US enterprises and state governments which have a less hostile attitude toward China, since it is almost certain that the US will try to cut off or reduce its dependence on China in producing medical supplies and drugs, Jin said. ""China's domestic market and retail industry are recovering, so strong domestic demand is also a countermeasure for China to handle the decoupling.""The economies in East Asia and Southeast Asia are recovering as well, and the damage caused by the pandemic in South Korea, Japan and ASEAN states is lighter than those in the US and Europe, and they are also willing to deepen and expand trade ties with China to realize regional recovery. So China can also seek more options to cover for the likely decoupling with the US, said Lü Xiang, a research fellow on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.But the decoupling unilaterally pushed by the US side risks increasing strategic conflicts between the two major powers, and Taiwan, the South China Sea and the Korean Peninsula could become potential conflict zones, Jin warned.

"Netizens call for Dutch products boycott, halt to medical exports over TaiwannPhoto taken on March 7, 2020 shows the view of Giethoorn in Overijssel, the Netherlands. (Xinhua/Zhang Cheng) The Netherlands' provocative move in changing its trade and investment office in Taiwan island to Netherlands Office Taipei, aimed at lifting its political relations with the island, is destructive to the regional stability and likely to face backlash, analysts said.The Chinese Embassy in the Netherlands has contacted the Dutch Foreign Ministry to lodge solemn representations after Guy Wittich, Representative of the Netherlands Trade and Investment Office in Taiwan, announced the simplification of the office's name to the Netherlands Office Taipei. The Chinese embassy has made a request for clarification of the matter.The embassy stressed that the Taiwan question concerns China's core interests and adhering to the one China principle is the political foundation for developing China-Netherlands relations. China urges the Netherlands to honor its commitment to the principle, properly handle Taiwan-related issues and take concrete actions to maintain the healthy and stable development of bilateral relations.Chinese netizens irritated by the Netherlands' move called on the Chinese companies to immediately stop exporting medical supplies to the country, and appealed to others to boycott all Dutch products and cancel their travel plans to the country.Some netizens posted photos of Zheng Chenggong, a military leader in the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) who expelled the Dutch invaders and colonialists from Taiwan in 1662, and commented that ""although he was from the Ming dynasty, many of his descendants are still here, just across the Taiwan Straits.""The Netherlands aims to lift its political relations with Taiwan island and strengthen its interference in China's internal affairs, which is extremely destructive to regional stability and has seriously disturbed international efforts to combat COVID-19, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Analysts pointed out that the announcement, which comes on the Netherlands' national day, known as King's Day, could remind many Taiwan compatriots of the history of Dutch colonial rule over Taiwan island in the 17th century. Dutch officials did not seem to be aware that the move boasts its former glory and could insult the island.Taiwan's ""Foreign Minister"" Joseph Wu said they welcomed Netherlands' decision and the move represented a positive step in relations between Taiwan and the Netherlands.""It's ridiculous that the Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has attempted to bow to foreign countries to achieve its goal of 'Taiwan independence,' has kidnapped the island and its people politically,"" Li said.Such a move will further tear apart Taiwan society and politics and result in long-term trauma to the island, Li said.Li also warned that the Netherlands' decision to change the name of its Taiwan office may trigger similar dangerous moves from other European countries. But no matter how the office conducts its activities on Taiwan island, it will not change the fact that Taiwan is a part of China, Li said.Li said China may consider suspending medical supplies to the Netherlands amid the coronavirus pandemic, and calling off some trade projects and people-to-people exchanges with the Netherlands to warn the country.

"Chinese mainland TV show sued for copyright infringement of letter belonging to late writer San Mao from the island of TaiwannPhoto: Snaptshot of Pear Video The news that the siblings of Sao Mao, a late influential writer from the island of Taiwan, filed a lawsuit against cultural variety show Letter Alive for infringing on San Mao's copyrights and modifying said content without permission went viral on Chinese social media on Sunday, World Intellectual Property Day.According to reports, the Beijing Internet Court tried the infringement case online on Friday, during which it livestreamed the trial. The court did not pronounce a judgment in court.The dispute focused on a letter that San Mao's father once wrote to the writer, a portion of which was read on an episode of the show's second season. The attorney for San Mao's siblings stated that the show had changed the name of the letter, altered a large portion of the text and broadcast the content of the letter on the show without permission from the rights holder. The plaintiff demanded compensation of 110,000 yuan ($15,533).However, the defendants said they did not recognize Sao Mao's siblings as the owners of the letter in question and believe that their actions fall within fair use in copyright law. They also said that the compensation is too high, Beijing News Daily reported on Sunday.The hashtag for the news had earned 230 million views on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo account as of Sunday afternoon, with many Chinese netizens criticizing the show's actions.""The original intent of this show was to introduce the soul and depth of literature, to be touched by life, but it lost this truth. It cut content without permission because it would incite the emotions of the audience. Shows from TV stations cannot blindly bow down to the supremacy of audience ratings, but need to be honest and standardized,"" one Chinese netizen commented on Sina Weibo.""We definitely support intellectual property! No programs and individuals have the right to change the original work,"" another netizen wrote on Sina Weibo.Liu Jiahui, a lawyer in intellectual property from a Chinese law firm Derun Lawyers based in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday that Sao Mao's siblings are the owners of the letter's copyright since their father has passed away, and the show Letter Alive has committed two copyright infringements.""The show used the letter without permission. Meanwhile, their behavior violated the integrity of the work by changing its content,"" Liu said. "	4/26/20	0	1	0.9783	1
"Mainland players boycott game that uses COVID-19 to humiliate ChinanGame ""Coronavirus Attack"" Photo: Screenshot of the game on Steam RELATED ARTICLES: Chinese embassy slams Danish newspaper over insulting cartoon An online game that insinuates China is the birthplace of COVID-19 and supports Taiwan and Hong Kong secessionists has been removed from the Chinese mainland while still being accessible to overseas players after mainland players exposed and boycotted it.The shooting game, ""Coronavirus Attack,"" priced at 15 yuan ($2.11), was developed by a US company and released on April 24 on the Steam game platform. ""The selfish zombie virus has infected the country. The virus carriers are attempting to flee the country. Your aim is to prevent the selfish zombie virus carriers from escaping and infecting the world,"" read the game description.The developer of the game, MZ, a secessionist resident of the island of Taiwan, posted on April 9 that he/she got inspiration from the Danish cartoonist Niels Bo Bojesen , who used five novel coronaviruses to depict the five stars on the Chinese national flag. The game uses a similar drawing.According to several screenshots and video clips released on Steam, the game features crude and simple graphics, while the flashing background is bright red and the novel coronavirus is drawn in bright yellow.Players who reach a certain level can unlock achievements, with one called ""Taiwan does not belong to China"" and another supporting Hong Kong secession.The game immediately provoked a large backlash among Chinese players.As of press time, 138 netizens criticized the game in simplified Chinese. One player said incompetent secessionists could only get a sense of achievement from such a virtual game, which is ""funny enough."" Some also condemned the game developer as being shameless, while others urged Steam to remove it.Some criticized the game developer for malicious and groundless insinuations that that the birthplace of the coronavirus was China.Meanwhile, some pro-secessionist media in Taiwan ignored the facts and called the game ""extremely favorable.""The Global Times failed to reach Steam as of press time, and the platform's customer service did not respond to the Global Times over the issue.The Global Times reporter found at about 10:00 am on Sunday that players on the Chinese mainland could not access the game, while the game remains available to overseas players.The game developer, MZ, also uploaded it onto Google Play in order to enable more people to join the game and humiliate China. After three weeks of review, his application was rejected for its inappropriate content.Previously, Taiwan-based game developer CrazyGhost developed a similar game, but due to the issue of image copyright and Google Play policy, the game was withdrawn and subsequent development was stopped. MZ said in his statement that the game was also inspired by CrazyGhost's games. "	4/26/20	0	0	-0.7948	-1
"DPP stirs opinions with water armynTaiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen (left) and YouTuber Potter King. Photo: Sina Weibo Taiwan's ""internet water army"" sponsored by the separatist political party - Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is now ruling the island - has been actively leading the fight in the international public opinion field, despite their lack of international horizons.Behind people like ""Executive Yuan"" member Audrey Tang Feng and internet influencer Yang Hui-ju, who are leaders of the ""virtual army,"" the real leaders are Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen and the New Frontier Foundation (NFF), which is under the DPP's central party department, Chiu Yi, former Taiwan legislator and Director of the Taiwan Institute for Economic Research, told the Global Times.The NFF is a think tank that was founded in 1999, according to its website. However, Chiu noted that the post of the foundation's chairman is usually held by the DPP president, and many cyber ghostwriter leaders have held important posts in the foundation, so it is like a reservoir of talent for the DPP.Although Tsai has stepped down from the post of DPP president, she still controls the NFF via her close friend Hsu Chia-ching.Hsu is one of the few people who has the trust of Tsai. She has been treated by the public as an ""avatar"" for Tsai, who is not good at social interaction.According to Chiu, the DPP decided to enhance its function with the ""internet water army"" after its disastrous defeat in the December 2018 election, and Hung Yao-fu, who had just resigned from the post of DPP secretary general, replaced Hsu as the agent for Tsai.""I saw some contracts that the DPP central party department signed with some internet marketing companies, and I found that Hung is the person who signed these contracts on behalf of Tsai. So it is certain that Hung is the current leader of the internet water army.""Tsai suddenly gained a nickname of ""Spicy Taiwanese Sister"" at the beginning of 2019 and all DPP-friendly media on the island claimed that the title came from ""Tsai's strong opposition to the one-China principle."" But Chiu said that the title is a persona Hung created for Tsai after he took over the role of leader of ghostwriters.The title has swept through the island. And Tsai's re-election win in January 2020 was described by Taiwan media as ""the image of 'Spicy Taiwanese Sister' safeguarding sovereignty sending her back to power.""How did the cyber army operators manage to contribute a lot for Tsai's reappointment?Facebook user ""night high hacker"" is an expert in Taiwan social media. He told the media in a recent interview that the DPP had been cultivating ghostwriters in campus networks before it took office.Those students entered the media industry after graduation. Some start their own media platforms, and gradually took the floor in the public opinion field and became an army for the DPP's publicity.The DPP, after taking office, started to integrate them in various ways.""DPP entrusts internet marketing companies and change them frequently.Chiu told the Global Times that the money is mainly from the central committee of the DPP, the other part is from regional governments under DPP rule.""The cost to establish and run these companies is very low and strictly speaking, they are bogus companies. Using Tsai's administration as support, they can get funds easily,"" Chiu said.The Global Times found from documents about one of these companies that its initial money was about NT$500,000 ($16,630).""Marketing companies started to integrate the internet water army once they got funds,"" Chiu said. The first group they reached was internet influencers, which they define as netizens with more than 100,000 followers, such as 'curator' Chen Chih-han and bisexual YouTuber Zhong Ming-xuan.""The second group is composed of internet celebrities who have a lot of accounts such as Yang Hui-ju.""Yang is not a big player but rather a mercenary,"" Chiu said. Yang's curses against World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Facebook, including words like ""Negro"" are still on her Facebook page.According to Chiu, some new media platforms have been integrated, such as New Talk and Fount Media. These platforms receive material from the DPP to attack in the same direction. Internet celebrities will operate their accounts to lead public opinion.Chiu said his social media account once received more than 50,000 attack messages that said nearly the same thing. Traditional media will follow from there. Apple Daily and Liberty Times will call to conduct interviews, and political commentary TV shows will follow to expand the speculation.""One tiny speck will become a dark mass, which is what they would like to see."" Photo taken on July 21, 2019 from Xiangshan Mountain shows the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan. Photo:Xinhua The water army has attacked people ranging from WHO director-general Tedros to former NBA player Jeremy Lin, and this cyber bullying has shocked the international community.Chiu believed such moves showed that the DPP was using the pandemic to seek space for its separatist agenda and wanted to join the WHO. Therefore, it became active on international social media platforms.""But it is obvious that the management of such platforms is naive and chaotic, unlike on local platforms that they can fully master and have better control of,"" Chiu said.The virtual army carries out missions from Tsai's administration and becomes her online fighters. The DPP does not mind the army's' dirty language and even encourages such indecency, making it unruly, analysts said.Having checked the performances of the DPP's cyber army on local social media platforms and international platforms, the Global Times found subtle differences. For example, the rhetoric is much stronger on local platforms than on international platforms. At PTT, the internet army would be extremely bitter and harsh, using strong words such as ""Nico"" and ""Nigga"" to insult Tedros. However, on Twitter, it prefers to play poor, use milder words and pretend to be the weak group.Some interviewees told the Global Times that compared with Twitter, Taiwan netizens are more used to using Facebook. The Global Times noticed that the DPP's cyber army used stronger and more aggressive language on Facebook than on Twitter.Chiu explained the reasons for such differences. On one hand, the DPP 's cyber army has insufficient international vision, and it has a sense of strangeness in the face of international problems, which in turn leads to a sense of inferiority.""Although they do not want to admit that they are frogs at the bottom of the well, they know in their hearts that the DPP is insignificant internationally, and the DPP cyber army is even more insignificant in the international arena. The sense of inferiority makes them use different terms, a self-abased tone in international platforms. A typical example is during a verbal war between Chinese and Thailand netizens, some netizens apparently from Taiwan tried to rope in Thailand and Hong Kong netizens. They liked each others' posts and showed a seeming victory of ""Taiwan and Hong Kong independence."" Chiu called the scene a ""public consensus built on sand.""""It is like a mirage, which looks colorful but is hollow inside,"" Chiu said, noting that it is fake public opinion. But it is difficult to make this clear in Taiwan, as many people on the island are engaged and being used as tools.Why does the DPP connive with the water army and even make a fool of itself in the international opinion field? Chiu explained that it is because the DPP and Tsai do not really care about Taiwan entering the WHO, which they know is impossible, nor Taiwan's international image.""All they want is to use the pandemic to seek independence and stir up anti-China emotions.""""The DPP is using anti-China emotions in the US and in the West in general to create a fake victory,"" Chiu said.Some Western senators would voice support for Taiwan to enter the WHO after accepting money from Tsai. Taiwan media will hype the act, while the internet water army creates the false impression that there are wide supportive voices for Taiwan separatism.""Taiwan netizens definitely will get excited after seeing these news reports and this is why nowadays, Taiwan youngsters are 'born pro-separatists.' So the DPP has to continue to stir up battles, collude with international anti-China forces, and encourage Taiwan netizens to join in for spiritual pleasure. The only ones who can benefit from this are the DPP and the internet marketing companies working with them."" "	4/23/20	0	0	0.9824	1
"DPP ‘behind Taiwan ghostwriters’nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus speaks at a daily briefing in Geneva, Switzerland on March 9. Photo: Xinhua Since early April, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus suffered cyber violence on social media networks and his Twitter account is now still filled with sarcastic and abusive comments with a considerable number originating in Taiwan.Pro-Chinese mainland experts based in Taiwan said that the comments were left by Taiwan's ""internet water army"" sponsored by the separatist political party - Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is now ruling the island.The experts said they were familiar with individual incidents being used to hype anti-Chinese mainland sentiment and inciting conflicts between the Chinese mainland and other countries.They said the DPP stigmatized and smeared anti-separatist KMT candidates in the Taiwan regional election in January 2020.""Taiwan people rarely use Twitter. We like Facebook more,"" a Taiwan-based resident, who asked for anonymity, told the Global Times, adding that because of this, it was abnormal to see that many Taiwan accounts on Twitter. Many accounts were registered just in April.""Abuses, or racist comments, giving me names, black or Negro… this attack came from Taiwan,"" Tedros told reporters in a press briefing from WHO's Geneva headquarters on April 8.The terms like ""Negro"" seldom show up on internet platforms like Twitter as it would cause international public outrage. But Chinese mainland analysts said such abuse was ""quite common"" on PTT, the largest terminal-based bulletin board system in the island of Taiwan, with its core theme hyping hatred against the Chinese mainland.But Chinese mainland analysts said such abuse was ""quite common"" on PTT, the largest terminal-based bulletin board system in the island of Taiwan, with its core theme hyping hatred against the Chinese mainland.A Taiwan political commentator with the pen name ROCky who requested anonymity told the Global Times that ""so-called cyber warriors, or internet ghostwriters, of Taiwan's green camp [pro-separatist camp], have some favorite themes in their propaganda plan in the international public opinion field.""They smeared the Chinese mainland as ""undemocratic, uncivilized and nouveau riche,"" ROCky said.They stressed Taiwan's ""sovereignty"" and said the island was ""suppressed"" by the Chinese mainland, portraying it as ""tragic"" to seek support from anti-China forces from other countries including the US and Japan, ROCky said.These ""cyber warriors"" use fake identities and pretend to be parties concerned with news stories, ROCky believed.ROCky noted that in early 2019, the pro-green camp Taiwan People News, used a fake Facebook account to attack Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen in simplified Chinese, hoping to create an illusion that some Chinese mainlanders were interfering in the Taiwan regional election.But the Taiwan People News forgot to switch its account and its remarks were mixed with both simplified and traditional Chinese characters: a giveaway of its real identity as traditional Chinese characters are mainly used in the island of Taiwan.Wang Bing-chung, spokesperson of the New Party, a pro-reunification political party in Taiwan, told the Global Times that the DPP of Taiwan has two ways to manipulate the island's social media.The first was to raise requirements for officials in the name of preventing fake news and penetration by the Chinese mainland. ""That's why many Facebook groups, which supports Han Kuo-yu, candidate of the KMT of this year's Taiwan regional leader election, were banned during the campaign,"" Wang said. Han Kuo-Yu (center), ""presidential candidate"" for Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party, is greeted by the supporters while visiting Chingan temple on the campaign trail in Keelung on Tuesday, ahead of the Sunday ""presidential"" and parliamentary elections. Photo: AFP ROCky said that on Taiwan social media, one would not be banned for writing the insulting word ""shina,""(a racist word against Chinese people, like ""Negro"" for Africans) but could be banned for insulting pro-Japan or pro-independence figures.The second DPP method was financially supporting ""cyber warriors,"" Wang said. Companies of DPP members paid low-income people to post anything they are told, he told the Global Times.Taiwan's future would be determined only by the cross-Straits relationship, Wang said.""Tsai is bluffing via making fake illusion that a majority of people in Taiwan are anti-China, but that's all false, with fundamental issues left unresolved,"" he said.

"Taiwan should restrain from seeking attention: Global Times editorialnPhoto: Xinhua The Taiwan authorities have launched attacks on World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus together with Washington. In addition, addressing an online forum held by a Washington-based conservative think tank, Joseph Wu, ""foreign minister"" of the Taiwan island, boasted that Taiwan's effective prevention work shows that its ""democratic model"" can successfully stem the spread of the epidemic in a different way from the mainland's ""authoritarian system."" Wu's remarks were laughed at by netizens: Taiwan has more confirmed coronavirus cases than any of the provinces on the mainland. How dare Wu call it a success? As the pandemic rages on, almost all ""democratic countries"" have been hit hard and unable to effectively handle the situation. Wu shouldn't have taken the pandemic as an opportunity to brag about the superiority of the ""democratic model."" Blowing hot air is a taboo to epidemic prevention and control. The mainland has made remarkable achievements, but it hasn't trumpeted a ""Chinese anti-epidemic model"" so far. Instead, China repeatedly emphasized that grave challenges remain, and it's of great importance to prevent local and imported cases. The island of Taiwan has been a little less impacted by the pandemic than countries like Japan and South Korea, which has made it complacent. Like a frog in a well, Wu even claimed Taiwan would share its anti-epidemic model with the rest of the world. Because of its narrow-mindedness, the Democratic Progressive Party cannot recognize the key trends of the changing world. Therefore, it has closely followed Washington, doing whatever Washington asks it to do in exchange for security with loyalty and mitigate risks brought about by its secessionist tendency. Washington recently shifted the blame to the WHO as it continued to pass the buck. The world knows the US is playing dirty tricks. No other government followed Washington and the UN has firmly stood with WHO and Ghebreyesus. Taiwan is the only one behind Washington to attack Ghebreyesus. The Tsai Ing-wen authorities don't have any dignity as the island is not a country. We advise the Taiwan authorities not to be so reckless. They shouldn't naively believe the more closely they follow the US, the higher political scores they will gain and the safer they are even if the island takes a radical path. With the deepening of China-US differences and with Washington going too far in suppressing the mainland, misjudgments and rash moves made by Taiwan will likely turn the Taiwan Straits into a flashpoint that will severely impact the world order in the post-pandemic era. The island will face real danger at that time. Many people worry that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to bring the world into the most serious disorder and chaos since World War II. The US wrongly responded to the pandemic from a geopolitical perspective, which will pose the biggest threat to the world. This is a severe test to major power relations. The Taiwan authorities shouldn't turn the island into a powder keg in the China-US confrontation for their personal political interests. If the Taiwan question leads to a China-US showdown, no matter what the results, Taiwan will pay an unbearable price. Even if there wasn't a war, an all-around confrontation between the world's two biggest powers will have a catastrophic effect on Taiwan society. The world has entered an eventful period, during which Taiwan is ineligible to play an active role. Taiwan authorities should have the basic rationality to act cautiously. Otherwise, they have to pay the price for their self-righteousness and recklessness. "	4/10/20	0	1	-0.9842	-1
"Chinese PLA holds ‘regular’ drills near Taiwan in preparation for military struggle: expertsnTwo J-11 fighter jets and a H-6K bomber fly in formation on May 11, 2018. Photo: Xinhua The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) reportedly held military drills featuring warplanes near the island of Taiwan on Friday, and such drills, having taken place at least four times since the traditional Spring Festival holiday in January, have become regular and are now a part of military struggle preparations against the island, mainland experts said on Friday.Multiple PLA warplanes, including the H-6 bombers, KJ-500 early warning aircraft and J-11 fighter jets, conducted a far-sea long-range drill above southwestern waters near the island of Taiwan on Friday, Taiwan media reported on Friday, citing the island's defense authority.The PLA warplanes entered the Western Pacific Ocean through the Bashi Channel, then returned to base along the same route they came from, reports from the island said.Song Zhongping, a mainland military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Friday that the drills were a part of preparations for the potential military struggle against the island of Taiwan, and such drills have become regular and routine.After the traditional Spring Festival holiday in late January, the PLA conducted a combat-readiness patrol mission featuring warships and warplanes on February 9, joint exercises on February 10, and ""rare"" warplane nighttime exercises on March 16, all near the island of Taiwan, despite the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.Song said he expects the PLA to gradually hold larger and more frequent drills, and for the drills to become more targeted and have more deterrence, such as decapitation strikes against secessionist forces and area denial operations against foreign intervention.The exercises need to let Taiwan secessionists know that the support of foreign forces is useless and also let foreign forces understand that the PLA possesses the ability and determination to solve the Taiwan question, Song said.The drills on Friday also came after the US recently signed the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act into law, which allows the US to reduce, expand or terminate economic and diplomatic engagements with nations that take actions to undermine Taiwan, and help Taiwan island gain participation in international organizations, either as a member or an observer, and provide weapons to the island.Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said following the signing of the US act on March 26 that China's national reunification and rejuvenation will not be stopped by any force.

Tedros commented specifically on the insults that he said came from Taiwan.""Three months ago, this attack came from Taiwan. We need to be honest. I will be straight today. From Taiwan,"" he said. ""And Taiwan, the 'Foreign Ministry' also, they know the campaign. They didn't disassociate themselves. They even started criticizing me in the middle of those insults and slurs, but I didn't care.""Li said the WHO is a professional organization dedicated to public health, but Taiwan has treated it as a political organization to push separatism and shake the one-China principle, so unsurprisingly it would be angry on the WHO as it cannot join the organization, even though obstacles do not stand in its way of receiving information on the pandemic from the organization.Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian also defended the WHO on Thursday. Zhao said at the daily press conference that ""China opposes any attempt to use the epidemic for purpose of politicization or stigmatization, and strongly condemns the personal attacks and racist words and deeds against WHO DG Tedros.""""Under the leadership of Tedros, the WHO has played an important role in assisting countries' responses to the epidemic and promoting international anti-epidemic cooperation by actively fulfilling its responsibilities and upholding an objective, science-based and unbiased stance, which has been widely recognized and highly praised by the international community. China supports the WHO in continuing to play a leading role in global anti-epidemic cooperation,"" Zhao said.Those Western politicians who doubt the WHO's credibility and professionalism are self-contradictory. They follow the WHO's guidance to prevent COVID-19; meanwhile, they're reluctant to admit that the organization's scientists' suggestion of learning China' experiences is right, and they also downplayed the warnings sent from the WHO during the early stages of the pandemic. It is unfair for these same politicians to blame the WHO and China since they should be responsible for the outbreak in their countries, Li noted.Zhao noted that since the outbreak, the DPP authorities in Taiwan have been doing everything they can to make political maneuvers and hype up Taiwan's participation in the WHO and the World Health Assembly.""Their real intention is to seek separatism under the pretext of the pandemic. We are firmly opposed to that. Their scheme will never succeed,' he said.Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan studies at Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times that it would be dangerous if the US and other Western countries to use Taiwan or other excuses to force professional scientists to leave the WHO, as it would damage the credibility of the organization and would also be harmful to the global fight against the pandemic.

"MOE suspends Taiwan education programs for mainland studentsnTourists take photos from Xiangshan Mountain in Taipei, Southeast China's Taiwan, June 20, 2019. Photo: Xinhua China's Ministry of Education (MOE) announced on Thursday the Chinese mainland would suspend all programs and work that involves sending mainland students to study in Taiwan, given the state of the COVID-19 pandemic and current cross-Straits relations.According to a statement released on the ministry's website, the policies for Taiwan students to apply for mainland universities will remain unchanged for 2020. Currently, the most important mission is to guarantee mainland students at Taiwan universities can return to Taiwan to finish their studies as the island authority has banned all mainland residents from entering Taiwan, the statement also said.According to the Xinhua News Agency, since the separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority in Taiwan issued a temporary travel ban for mainland residents on February 6, and most Taiwan schools and universities opened in late February and early March, many mainland students who had already returned home for the holidays could not go back to Taiwan and finish their courses.The legal demand among mainland students didn't receive a response or any assistance from the DPP authority, and Taiwan universities also failed to help protect mainland students' legal right to receive an education, and instead passed the buck and kicked the students off the island, officials told Xinhua.Zheng Bo-yu, 32, from Taiwan, has worked in Beijing for years and told the Global Times that this shows cross-Strait relations have worsened, and students are just the victims of the politics.Zheng, also manager of the Beijing-based Vstartup Station of Taiwan, an institution helping Taiwan youth apply to mainland universities and gain internships at mainland firms, said that ""the DPP authority is using the pandemic as an excuse to cut off the people-to-people exchange between the mainland and the island.""The mainland's decision is not a surprise as the island doesn't allow anyone from the mainland to enter Taiwan anyway, he noted.However, the mainland didn't retaliate to innocent Taiwan students, who can still come to the mainland, according to the education ministry's statement. Taiwan students on the mainland are well-protected, and none of the Taiwan students on the mainland has been infected with COVID-19, Xinhua reported on Thursday.Zheng predicted that Taiwan students who apply at mainland universities would drop by 40 percent this year, and it's because of the pandemic, but the fundamental reason is that the DPP authority and separatists in Taiwan have already poisoned cross-Straits ties.

"Taiwan separatists use COVID-19 to poison cross-Straits tiesnA citizen runs in front of the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan, on Oct. 1, 2019. (Xinhua/Chen Bin) The song ""Fight as One"" by pop singers Eason Chan from Hong Kong and Jolin Tsai from Taiwan in support of medical staff and people around the globe fighting the COVID-19 pandemic has received cyber violence from Taiwan separatists as the extremists said this is a ""foreign propaganda from the Chinese mainland.""Chinese mainland experts noted that the separatists were using the pandemic to poison cross-Straits ties and the society of the island has already been radicalized. The cyber violence against the song was just another example to prove the island's society was already radicalized by the separatist authority and many people were atomically being hostile to anything about the mainland,analysts said. The separatists ignore the humanitarian principle, and the pandemic has been used as a good chance for the separatists to push their political purpose worldwide, they noted.The English video by the state-owned Yunnan Media Group was uploaded on YouTube on Friday and had received more than 470,000 views as of Tuesday, but most comments were negative.The song, which expressed support and gratitude toward medical staff and people battling the pandemic, was criticized harshly by Taiwan's web users who noted the ""Chinese national flag appeared in the video"" and ""foreign children held up paintings thanking China for its assistance to their countries.""""The producer was a mainland media group and the two pop stars were serving a propaganda mission,"" the online critics argued.Li Xiaobing, a Taiwan studies expert at Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times Tuesday that ""in the past, when the mainland was facing a huge disaster, like the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, Taiwan-based pop stars did a lot of public welfare programs in support of the mainland, and at that time, no one got criticized and the ideological difference between the two sides could be laid aside.""But today, any support for the mainland from Taiwan-based singers can be treated as a 'betrayal of Taiwan' on the island - even a song that doesn't mention Taiwan at all.""The angry online response to the song demonstrated a ""radicalized"" atmosphere on the island, Chinese experts said.When the mainland was suffering the most serious situation in January and February, the separatist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority banned export of medical masks to the mainland.On April 1, the DPP authority announced a donation of 10 million masks to the US and European countries even as people in Taiwan were only allowed to buy nine masks per person per two weeks, Taiwan-based media reported.""There is nothing wrong with donating masks to people in need, but the DPP authority shows very different attitudes toward the mainland and the West,"" said Li.That was why people in the mainland felt ""disgusted,"" Li said.""The mainland has massive production capacity and is already the logistics base of this global fight and we don't need masks from Taiwan, but still, Taiwan separatist behavior is poisoning the ties with the mainland.""Some separatist Taiwan media outlets use the term ""Wuhan virus"" or ""China virus"" for COVID-19 even after US President Donald Trump stopped using the phrase and most mainstream media outlets dropped it to avoid discrimination against specific region or country.""We are being treated as a family member in Beijing, but the authority in Taiwan just refused us to come back, and the media of my hometown even keep saying stigmatizing words to the mainland every day without any help,"" Joseph Lam, a Taiwan student at a Beijing-based university, told the Global Times.""Their radicalism can't even accept a song which just talks about love and encourages people to be strong. What a shame.""Chinese mainland experts warned the pandemic was being used by the DPP authority and separatists of the island to maximize their political purpose such as hyping Taiwan's non membership of the World Health Organization and exaggerating Taiwan's ""contribution"" and ""performance"" to the global fight.Li, the Tianjin-based expert, noted that some voices from the West dubbed mainland assistance ""mask diplomacy,"" but in fact Taiwan is the one who actually using masks for politics such as making some politicians in France urge WHO to accept Taiwan as a formal member.Chinese Embassy in France has released an open letter on its website on Monday to condemn such behavior.According to the island's regional leader Tsai Ing-wen's announcement on April 1, the authority will donate 7 million masks to Europe and 2 million to the US. And according to the French health ministry, the mainland will provide 1 billion masks to France.China has donated 1,000 ventilators to New York state and Chinese IT firm Huawei also donated thousands of masks and personal protective equipment to the US, even the firm is still under sanctions and unfairly treated by the US government.Li said some US and European politicians and media did not show gratitude to the mainland and remained critical and suspicious over China-made products, but they treated Taiwan as a ""true friend.""Chinese mainland experts noted that Taiwan separatists won't achieve their purpose eventually and there was no chance for them to join any international organization as a formal state.But the separatists can successfully make people on the mainland resent them and lose hope of a peaceful solution to the Taiwan question, they warned.

"Taiwan's green camp shows narrow-mindedness by targeting virus fight songnJolin Tsai Photo: IC ""Fight as One,"" a song jointly sang by Eason Chan from Hong Kong and Jolin Tsai from Taiwan, has been targeted by the island's green camp media, which supports the secessionist government, and some overly sensitive people on the island. The song, produced by Yunnan Media Group and a production team including members from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan, is an ode that aims only to encourage people to fight together to contain COVID-19. Its aim is to inspire people to overcome the disaster and embrace a bright future.How did Jolin Tsai become a thorn in the eyes of the green camp for recording a charity song about the virus fight? The green camp is somehow dismayed that a photo in the music video features images of doctors did not include doctors from Taiwan. The video also shows some young kids hold a drawing board with the word ""China,"" and this too has been deemed unacceptable to the green camp.The secessionist forces in Taiwan are shamelessly seeking personal gain. They view the song, which calls for solidarity in the global pandemic fight, from the narrow-minded perspective of ""Taiwan independence"" and have immediately labeled it ""political incorrect.""When people on the mainland talk about being united against the pandemic, entanglement across the straits rarely comes to mind, if ever. It's obvious that Yunnan Media Group teamed up with the stars to increase the popularity of the song. The producers had no intention of targeting Taiwan.Cross-Straits ties have nothing to do with the theme of the song and there is nothing wrong with using a photo meant to picture worldwide solidarity in the virus fight. For the green camp, the first thing that came to their mind is where is Taiwan? Has Taiwan been somehow dwarfed? This knee-jerk response is unbecoming.I sincerely encourage people in Taiwan's green camp to be more broad-minded. Mainlanders are not complicated. We go straight to the thing we want to accomplish; we have no ulterior motive or plan to trap others. Some people in the green camp in Taiwan are far too sensitive and hysterical.The attack on Jolin by the green camp will likely make her feel uncomfortable and concerned. People everywhere else will like the song, because it expresses the shared emotions of all people and conveys their goodwill of mutual support. There is no reason for people to dislike the heartfelt tune.Those in the green camp who oppose the song should feel ashamed of themselves. They need to broaden their horizon and open their mind and keep pace with the world.The author is editor-in-chief of the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	4/7/20	0	0	0.8955	1
"Mainland game developer ends cooperation with Taiwan agent over virus referencenPhoto taken with a mobile phone shows cured patients waving goodbye to medical workers before leaving the Leishenshan hospital in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province. On Sunday, 17 coronavirus-infected patients recovered and were discharged from the hospital. Photo: Xinhua The use of ""Wuhan virus"" by Taiwan game players to refer to the novel coronavirus has led to the Chinese mainland-based game developer terminating cooperation with the island's regional agent, and such behavior has been criticized by observers as purely discriminatory rather than so-called freedom of speech.Mainland game developer Seasun Entertainment announced on China's Twitter-like social media platform Sina Weibo on Sunday that it terminated cooperation with its Taiwan regional agent Wanin International, after island players called the coronavirus ""Wuhan virus"" on the Chinese national day of mourning for COVID-19 victims, which took place on Saturday.The mainland firm temporarily closed the game, a Wuxia-themed online game known as JX3, on Saturday morning. Some Taiwan-based gamers were upset by this arrangement and vented their dissatisfaction on Weibo.Some even called the coronavirus ""Chinese Wuhan virus"" in the chatroom after the game resumed online. These comments were captured in screenshots by other gamers and reported to the developer.Consequently, the mainland firm suspended for 10 years some accounts of players who made these inappropriate comments, and it condemned such speech early on Sunday.""In terms of the national interest, the bottom line cannot be touched,"" according to the company's statement.However, the Taiwan agent later announced its support for the players' right to speak, threatened to end cooperation with the mainland firm, and re-activated the suspended accounts.The mainland game developer announced it would terminate cooperation with its Taiwan client 22 minutes after the post.Chinese cyberspace security expert Zhu Wei, a communications researcher at the China University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times on Monday that the actions of some Taiwan residents and media outlets to wrongly name the virus went beyond ""freedom of speech"" and hurt the feelings of Wuhan residents who suffered a lot amid the epidemic.As the World Health Organization officially named the virus COVID-19, such speech could only lead to regional discrimination, Zhu noted.

"Burger King apologizes after using racist term to name COVID-19, sparking furynPhoto: cnsphoto Burger King China, the Chinese mainland operator of the multinational chain of hamburger fast food restaurants, made a public apology on Sina Weibo Sunday on behalf of the US brand's Taiwan branch for using ""Wuhan pneumonia"" to refer to COVID-19 in a post on Facebook Wednesday.However, such a move has worked quite to the contrary, and failed to quell public anger, with many pointing out that the ringleader of the case, has yet to show any signs of regret.According to a screenshot of the post made by @BurgerkingTW, allegedly the official account of the Burger King operator in Taiwan, made a racist reference to COVID-19 in a post to promote its non-contact delivery services..The post cannot be found on its Facebook page as of press time, and no explanation has been given for its removal.Amongst comments on another post made by the account, there are still many users demanding an apology from the firm.""Although Burger King China and the operator in Taiwan are different operating firms, we feel embarrassed about the Taiwan operator's irresponsible remarks,"" said Burger King China on its Sina Weibo account on Sunday.As a member of the Burger King family, we feel deeply sorry for the irresponsible statements made by the regional branch operator, it said, while stressing that the company has been fighting the epidemic with everyone shoulder to shoulder, by not only donating 1 million yuan to Wuhan, but also delivering food to workers on the frontline, despite business being affected by the epidemic.The mainland branch also said it has contacted the responsible personnel from the Taiwan regional operator to urge the latter to delete the racist post at once, and apologize for its actions.The discussion going on under the hashtag ""#Burgerkingapologies""has gathered some 150 million views and 7,500 comments as of press time on Weibo.""The use of the racist term just upset me big-time, and I will cancel all my future orders from Burger King,"" read one comment among a few expressing their intentions to boycott the brand.However, more netizens showed their reasoning, pointing out that these are two totally different companies and the mainland firm deserves our understanding and support as it stood up and made a due apology for their Taiwan operators' fault"" wrote another.Netizens also called for the Taiwan regional operator to stand up and say sorry itself, saying that "" deleting the post secretly is a cowardly move and they should own their mistakes..""The deliberate use of the terms of ""Wuhan virus/ pneumonia"" or ""Chinese virus"" especially after the WHO officially named the epidemic COVID-19, should be considered racist, as it helps promote nothing but hatred and makes no contribution to mankind's worldwide battle against the disease, observers said.Burger King entered the mainland market in 2005 with its first franchise opening in Shanghai, now the US brand has more than 1,000 stores in the Chinese mainland with 25,000 employees serving 150 million customers every year.Global Times "	3/29/20	0	0	-0.9895	-1
"US stirs up instability by signing ‘Taipei Act’ despite COVID-19 pandemicnPhoto:Xinhua US President Donald Trump's signing of the ""Taipei Act,"" which is only a piece of paper that costs nothing for the US but may fool Taiwan island, into law on Thursday amid a global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic shows that the US is only acting to serve its own interests at the expense of damaging China-US ties to provoke instability in the region and its ""Taiwan card"" will only be counterproductive, experts claimed.The initiative in the cross-Straits is firmly in the hands of the Chinese mainland. Reunification of Taiwan island is the iron will of the Chinese nation. The Taiwan DPP must not have illusions on the matter, experts warned.US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed into law the ""Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative Act of 2019"" and the bill is aimed at propping up international presence of Taiwan island.For Trump, it is only a performance of procedure since the act was passed by both the US Senate and House of Representatives in early March but it came at a time when all nations are busy with the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, which reflects the US is only acting to serve its own interests by stirring up trouble in the Asia-Pacific region instead of focusing on its own fight against the pandemic when the US is now No.1 in confirmed coronavirus cases, experts noted.Playing the Taiwan card is on the must-to-do list for Trump to secure ballot tickets for the upcoming 2020 president election, as for the global fight against the pandemic, Trump has been treating it with contempt, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Friday.It is such an unethical act. No matter how much China provides to US aid in its fight against the epidemic, the US will not stop its efforts to harm China's interests. If the US continues to do so, China's future assistance to it might be affected, said Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of China Foreign Affairs University.The Taipei Act authorizes the US State Department to reduce, expand or terminate economic and diplomatic engagements with nations that take actions to undermine Taiwan. Under the act, the US government will help Taiwan island gain participation in international organizations, either as a member or an observer, and provide weapons to the islands.The act aims at interfering in other countries' internal affairs through US' diplomatic system, and the US may come up with policies to reduce economic support to nations that undermine Taiwan island, but these nations will surely put their national interests first rather than following directions of the US, experts said.At the very least, how much international space does the Taiwan administration have when there are only 15 remaining small ""diplomatic allies"" who may not cut ties with the island in fear of Washington's intimidation? Ultimately, the bill will only offer some psychological comfort to the DPP authority, analysts noted.After Tsai Ing-wen took office, she refused to recognize the ""1992 Consensus,"" which caused the international space of Taiwan island to shrink sharply, and lost seven nations that had ""diplomatic relations"" with it.Li Xiaobing, an expert on Taiwan affairs at Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times that America's empty promise of ""support for Taiwan"" is cliché, and its attempts to play the Taiwan card is plain to see.This is not the first time that the US has passed Taiwan-related enabling acts in recent years, examples include the Taiwan Travel Act in 2018 and the Taiwan Assurance Act of 2019.By adopting such act, the US attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of China, and sends out the wrong signal to Taiwan island that they are backed by the US. But the act is only a dirty business between Taiwan separatists and pro-Taiwan US politicians who serve the interests of the US at the expense of peace and stability in the Western Pacific, experts noted.The foreign affairs committee of the National People's Congress expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to the US signing the act into law on Friday, urging the US to be aware of the high sensitivity of the Taiwan question and not implement the bill.In a statement released late Friday, the NPC said the bill ignores the one-China principle, which is the general consensus of the international community, and the fact that the US established diplomatic relations with China 41 years ago. It unreasonably obstructs other countries from establishing diplomatic ties with the Chinese mainland and aims to help Taiwan expand so-called ""international space,"" the NPC said.The signing of the Taipei Act violates the one-China principle and important consensus that the leaders of the two countries have achieved, which will seriously obstruct cooperation of the two nations and ultimately harm the interests of the US, the NPC wrote in the statement.The Chinese Foreign Ministry also expressed firm opposition to the bill on Friday, saying it is an act that wantonly interferes in China's internal affairs.Geng Shuang, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said the bill seriously violates the one-China principle, provisions of the three joint communiques between the two nations, and seriously violates international law and the basic norms of international relations.180 countries have established diplomatic relations with China. The US established diplomatic ties with China on the basis of the one-China principle more than 40 years ago. However, the bill blatantly obstructs other sovereign states from developing normal relations with China, which doesn't make sense and it is a naked hegemonic logic, Geng said.We urge the US to correct its mistakes, not to implement the law, and not to obstruct other nations from developing ties with China. Otherwise, China will firmly fight back, Geng said. "	3/27/20	0	0	-0.9939	-1
"Virus-plagued US still playing politics: Global Times editorialnThe night view of Taipei on June 20, 2019. Photo: Xinhua US President Donald Trump signed the so-called ""Taipei Act"" into law on Thursday. On the same day, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases surpassed 82,000 in the US, making it the country with the most confirmed cases. With such a tense situation in the US, Washington is still manipulating politics. It has become clear why the US has wasted the window period created by China and why it had sat back and watched the situation become worse.The ""Taipei Act"" was passed by the US Congress, and was then signed by the president. To a large extent, it represents Washington's overall attitude toward China: making full use of the Taiwan card to engage in strategic games with the mainland. But this is a bad card, and it is even more counterproductive as the world fights the pandemic.The ""Taipei Act"" promises support for Taiwan's ""diplomatic alliances."" To put it plainly, the US is threatening Taiwan's remaining ""diplomatic allies"" not to break ties with Taiwan, otherwise it will punish them. This is completely unreasonable. In total, 180 countries, including the US, have established diplomatic relations with China. The one-China principle has long been an international consensus. Can't other sovereign states make their independent choices? Washington is much too overbearing.However, this does not work in the current world. Before the ""Taipei Act"" was issued, Washington had coerced and induced ""diplomatic allies"" of Taiwan. But what happened then? After Tsai Ing-wen came to power, Taiwan has lost seven ""diplomatic allies."" This shows that no country can promote its own will in a way that runs counter to international axioms and harms other countries' interests, even a country as strong as the US.Even if the 15 small ""diplomatic allies"" of Taiwan covet the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority's petty favors, fear Washington's intimidation and choose not to break ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan, then what? How much international space does Taiwan have? After all, the ""Taipei Act"" only provides little psychological comfort to the DPP authority. Washington politicians are aware of this, and thus the wording of the act is mostly insincere.A Taiwan politician questioned the content of the ""Taipei Act"" on strengthening trade between the US and Taiwan: ""If the US requires us to import US pork and beef that contains clenbuterol, do we accept it?"" The chief of Taiwan's executive body Su Tseng-chang dared not answer explicitly. Obviously, the DPP has betrayed Taiwan's interests for Washington's empty political promise. This is a terrible deal for Taiwan. Some Taiwan netizens are much too clear about this. They said, ""The bill is signed, so what? It is useless."" ""It is an old trick of cheating money. We are being used again.""The Taiwan question concerns China's core interests and must not be challenged. Since the DPP came to power, it has made many small moves with a tendency of secession and was encouraged by Washington. Take the ""Taipei Act."" It has brought greater uncertainty to the situation across the Taiwan Straits. But the initiative of the situation is held firmly in the hands of the mainland. China's determination to reunify Taiwan island is unshakable, and whoever acts against it will end up in ruins. The DPP must not have any illusion about this. "	3/27/20	1	1	-0.9561	-1
"US sending destroyer through Taiwan Straits during pandemic a reckless move: expertsnA general view shows the flight deck on board the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) as the vessel sails toward the Straits of Malacca heading to Singapore on Friday. The aircraft carrier is on its way to Singapore for a stopover for a routine port visit before heading to San Diego. Photo: AFP Despite eight confirmed COVID-19 cases on US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt and fast increasing number in the US military across the world, the US on Wednesday reportedly sent a warship through the Taiwan Straits.Sending a warship through the Taiwan Straits at any time is seen as a provocation to Beijing but doing it now when Washington faces greater challenge to contain the COVID-19 seems especially reckless, analysts said.The US has been continuously taking negative actions on the Taiwan question including sending warships through the Taiwan Straits, which heavily interrupts China's internal affairs, sabotages peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, poisons ties between the two countries and the two militaries, and releases wrong signals to Taiwan secessionist forces, which are very dangerous, said Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Ren Guoqiang at a regular press conference on Thursday.The People's Liberation Army has the firm will, full confidence and enough capability to defeat any secessionist activities and safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Ren said.Ren's statement came after US destroyer McCampbell crossed the Taiwan Straits on Wednesday on a navigation training mission, Taiwan media reported on Thursday, citing the island's defense authority.The US military should focus on its own COVID-19 epidemic control work, because things are not looking good for them, a Chinese mainland military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Thursday.The Pentagon announced 53 new cases of US military service members on Wednesday, bringing the number to 227 worldwide, forcing US Defense Secretary Mark Esper to issue a stop movement order on Wednesday to the US military and halt all travel and movement abroad for up to 60 days, Reuters reported on Thursday.Another possibility is that the US destroyer was on its way back to base due to this stop order, but even so, it could send a wrong signal of encouragement to Taiwan secessionists, the expert said.The McCampbell's transit through the Taiwan Straits came at a time when five additional sailors aboard the US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, also deployed in the Pacific, have tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday, making the total number now eight, US media outlet the Hill reported on Thursday.Warships have tighter spaces and less comfortable living conditions than a civilian cruise ship, and staying in a confined space for too long will risk aerosol transmission as the virus density could be very high, warned Wang Peiyu, deputy head of Peking University's school of public health.Another military expert who asked for anonymity told the Global Times that Theodore Roosevelt is not just an aircraft carrier, but a representation of US' power. If the epidemic becomes a large scale one, it will not be just the carrier, but the entire fleet, the entire US Navy, and the US' image as a strong military power will be damaged, the expert said.

"Scientific channel suspends updates after being criticized for posting incomplete Chinese mapnPhoto: Paperclip The producer of a Chinese scientific program apologized on Monday for not including the island of Taiwan in its previous program on YouTube, in response to netizens' mounting criticism that the program did so to butter up foreign viewers.Wu Songlei, producer of Paperclip, which specializes in scientific programs, apologized on his Sina Weibo account. His apology came after many netizens said one of the team's programs, published in 2018, failed to include the island of Taiwan in the Chinese map while the island was shown as part of China on the same program that was broadcast on the domestic channel.Wu said that they did not make a double version of the program. They only noticed the map was problematic after their domestic channel, Bilibili, one of the most visited ACG websites in China, removed their video in 2019, because of the map.Then the team replaced the video with a complete Chinese map, but the video posted on YouTube remains the same.Paperclip strongly recognizes and upholds the one-China principle, Wu wrote, promising they ""absolutely did not alter the map on purpose or make a special version for foreign channels.""Wu said they will suspend updating videos, and vowed to re-examine all their videos with maps, to avoid such ""inferior mistakes.""Paperclip is a popular science video feeder in China, with more than 2 million fans on Bilibili, and 296,000 subscribers on YouTube.However, the team got into hot water not because of its map, but its recent video about deforestation in South America, which was misinterpreted by some fans as ""insulting Chinese.""The rainforest video, posted on Bilibili on Saturday, pointed out that China is Brazil's major consumer of beans, and cultivation of beans leads to deforestation. Moreover, before it mentioned China, the voiceover said ""humans consume more and more meat,"" which was also misinterpreted by netizens as ""insulting Chinese.""In response to the ""insult,"" many netizens swarmed online to criticize the program, saying the team is ""colluding with foreigners to insult China.""The team responded on Sunday urging netizens to remain calm and not to misinterpret their video, but netizens' anger did not subside.They further dug out the team's 2018 video, which involved the map without Taiwan as a weapon to attack the team.After the case, many netizens urged the team to stop updating videos completely, as ""they were clearly siding with foreign anti-China forces,"" and ""the bottom line of national unity cannot be violated.""But others said the angry netizens were using populism as a weapon to arouse public anger and to crack down on this scientific program.Global Times "	3/23/20	0	0	-0.9916	-1
"Taiwan facing risk of infection wave due to flawed control effort: expertsnTourists view the Taipei 101 skyscraper, a landmark in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan, Jan. 2, 2017. (Xinhua/Zhu Xiang) The island of Taiwan's epidemic control efforts against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) are seriously flawed and Taiwan is facing the risk of another wave of COVID-19 infections, as the island's authority previously only focused on preventing cases from the Chinese mainland but not those from the rest of the world, multiple experts from the island said on Wednesday.The experts' statements came after US-based media outlet Foreign Policy published an argument article on Monday titled ""Fear of China Made Taiwan a Coronavirus Success Story,"" which claimed the island had brought things under control using ""a combination of early vigilance, proactive measures, and information sharing with the public, as well as applying technology in the form of analyzing big data and online platforms.""It is ""in stark contrast to [the Chinese mainland]'s use of draconian and coercive measures and censorship to handle the coronavirus outbreak,"" the article claimed.The article was obviously attempting to undermine the Chinese mainland's epidemic control efforts, analysts said.However, 23 new cases were confirmed in Taiwan on Wednesday, with the total number now exceeding 100, local media reported. Taiwan had not seen a surge in confirmed cases like this since the first case was confirmed on January 21.Pan Huai-tsung, a health expert in Taiwan, told the Global Times on Wednesday that Taiwan's initial prevention efforts were indeed effective, but that was because there were luckily not so many cases that the island's capability to diagnose them were exceeded, and people in Taiwan had relatively good awareness of self-protection and quarantine.Echoing Pan, Cheng Po-yu, executive officer of a cross-Straits youth communication association, said, ""It was not because the Tsai Ing-wen administration took some special measures that contained the virus, it was because people have a strong awareness, since we all experienced SARS many years ago.""The Tsai Ing-wen administration is only taking credit for people's own awareness of the risks, Cheng said.Taiwan's prevention efforts started in early February, as the island took measures to limit people who lived in the Chinese mainland or had been there in the last 14 days from entering the island. It was only on Wednesday that the Taiwan authority warned people in Taiwan not to make non-essential trips to locations in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and people entering Taiwan from these regions should be quarantined for 14 days.Wang Bing-chung, a political commentator in Taiwan, told the Global Times on Wednesday that there were very few visitors from the mainland even before the outbreak, as self-guided travel had been suspended long ago. The real risk Taiwan is facing now is that it was only focusing on the mainland for prevention, but not the rest of the world.""The epidemic has already become serious around the world, and the US is criticized for delaying its epidemic control because it would not conduct tests… But Taiwan only announced further measures today, meaning it has already missed the best opportunity. So today's surge of more than 20 cases mostly came from other countries,"" Wang said on Wednesday.The Wall Street Journal said in a report on Wednesday that Taiwan may face a second wave of COVID-19 infections, a prediction Pan agrees with.Taiwan is not taking concentrated quarantine measures on people who are coming to the island from other countries and regions like the Chinese mainland is doing, Pan said, noting that they are only undergoing home quarantine.""This is worrying,"" Pan said, stressing that COVID-19 is a cunning virus that can spread without showing symptoms.The mainland's epidemic control efforts are a miracle, Pan said, noting that he hopes the mainland will help Taiwan if the island falls into a situation where the epidemic goes out of control.

"PLA warplanes conduct rare nighttime exercises near Taiwan: reportsnA J-11 fighter jet attached to an aviation brigade of the air force under the PLA Eastern Theater Command takes off from a military airfield during the round-the-clock flight training on January 6, 2020. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Fu Gan) Warplanes of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) reportedly conducted rare nighttime exercises near the island of Taiwan on Monday, and mainland analysts on Tuesday predicted that similar drills will become more frequent if Taiwan secessionist forces remain stubborn and continue their secessionist activities.Multiple PLA warplanes including the KJ-500 early warning aircraft and J-11 fighter jets conducted nighttime flight exercises at around 7:00 pm on Monday above the waters southwest of the island of Taiwan, Taiwan media reported on Monday, citing Taiwan's defense authority.This is the first time the PLA has conducted this kind of exercise at night, said Taiwan's defense authority, according to the report.The PLA nighttime drills showed that it is fully capable of launching military operations on the island at any time of a day, a military expert who asked not to be named told the Global Times on Tuesday.Similar drills are expected to become more frequent in order to let Taiwan secessionists get a clear idea of the power gap between the mainland and the island, the expert said.The latest exercises near Taiwan came after concentrated PLA exercises in February. On February 9 and 10, the PLA conducted two consecutive drills featuring naval and air forces near the island and crossed the ""middle line"" of the Taiwan Straits, in a warning to Taiwan secessionists.Island encirclement patrols used to be rare, crossing the ""middle line"" used to be rare and consecutive drills used to be rare, but they are not rare any more, and the same could apply for the nighttime drills, the expert said.Taiwan secessionist forces are disregarding the greater national interests, intensifying their scheme of pursuing ""independence,"" going against the trend and the will of the people, said Senior Colonel Zhang Chunhui, a PLA Eastern Theater Command spokesperson, on February 10.The PLA Eastern Theater Command troops are always on high alert, closely following the situation and are ready to resolutely fulfill their missions, Zhang said.The troops are determined and capable of crushing any ""Taiwan secessionist"" activities, resolutely safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity and peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, Zhang said previously.

"Washington’s ill-intended bill puts Taiwan at risknPhoto taken on July 21, 2019 from Xiangshan Mountain shows the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan. Photo:Xinhua The US House of Representatives recently passed the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative Act of 2019. The ""Taipei Act 2019"" may soon be sent to President Trump for his signature.The ""Taipei Act"" was concocted by pro-Taiwan forces in the US and the island's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities. It essentially lends US support to DPP authorities to maintain their remaining ties with other nations, supports Taiwan to participate in international organizations as members or observers, and promotes negotiations of economic and trade agreements between the US and DPP authorities.The Taipei Act 2019 reflects just one of the attempts by stubborn pro-Taiwan forces to erode the internationally recognized One-China framework. The US is also formulating other Taiwan-related bills. These bills are attempts to enhance political, military, security and economic relations between the US and Taiwan, and support the DPP's goal of ""Taiwan secession.""These acts are a grave violation of the one-China principle and the three Sino-US joint communiques, which were the basis for the diplomatic relations between China and the US. They are also a grave violation of international law and basic norms governing international relations, and a gross interference in China's internal affairs.Taiwan is a part of China, and the Taiwan issue is an internal affair of China. This has been a general consensus of the international community and a prerequisite of China for establishing relations with any country. Around the world, some 180 countries have established diplomatic relations with China based on this principle. Since the US established diplomatic relations with China in 1979, it has followed the one-China principle. Now, however, the US is intent on bullying and preventing other countries from developing normal state-to-state relations with China, an obivous attempt at increasing US hegemony, over the best interests of other countries.The one-China principle is universally recognized and accepted. The international community is opposed to Taiwan secessionist forces undermining peace and stability in the Taiwan straits, and the Chinese government has the ability, will and determination to curb various forms of Taiwan secession activities. The US needs to recognize and grasp these realities.Since establishing diplomatic relations with China, the US has continuously fiddled with its stance on the Taiwan question. This is very harmful and not conducive to stability across the Taiwan Strait. The US should immediately stop promoting Taiwan-related bills and stop interfering in the Taiwan question, so as to not further harm peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits.DPP authorities are taking advantage of the US' view of China as a primary strategic competitor. Over the past two years, DPP authorities have been an important promoter of the US bills relating to Taiwan. The direction and content of some bills clearly reflect the DPP's desire for Taiwan secession.DPP authorities have not recognized the 1992 Consensus, continue to promote de-Sinification of laws and policies, increased restrictions or cut off cross-strait exchanges, and allowed Taiwan separatist activities to escalate. During this period, the US has publicly acted as a protective umbrella over DPP authorities and Taiwan secession forces, sending out false signals, which have encouraged some political forces on the island to rely on the US in their quest for independence.The Chinese mainland's position is clear: any departure from the one-China principle will lead to tension and turbulence in cross-straits relations and harm the vital interests of Taiwan compatriots. Previous Taiwan-related US legislation has failed to bring any substantial benefits to the people on the island in terms of peace, stability, and development. On the contrary, the US legislation has destabilized the Taiwan straits and increased antagonism and confrontation in cross-straits relations. The US and DPP authorities have caused the people on the island to worry that Taiwan will become a pawn of the US and they will be the ones who eventually suffer the consequences.Taiwan secession goes against the historical trend and is a dead-end road. The Chinese mainland is capable of maintaining a strong deterrent against Taiwan secession forces and has the resolve to deal with them in a timely manner. Imagine at the time of a major historic turning point, the US can withdraw itself, but can Taiwan withdraw?The author is deputy director of Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	3/10/20	0	0	0.9481	1

"US House passage of TAIPEI Act symbolic, shows consistent plotting against China's development and reunification: observersnPhoto taken on July 21, 2019 from Xiangshan Mountain shows the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan. Photo:Xinhua RELATED ARTICLES: Taiwan entertainers facing boycott on island after slamming authorities over mainland mask ban The passage of the Taiwan-related legislation by the US House of Representatives on Wednesday is largely symbolic but demonstrates the US' consistent plots to contain China's development and obstruct the country's reunification by playing the Taiwan card, observers said on Thursday.The draft bill titled ""Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative Act of 2019,"" or TAIPEI 2019, was passed with a unanimous vote by the US House on Wednesday.Zhao Lijian, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said on Thursday that China resolutely opposes the passage of the bill. Zhao said the bill is against the trend as one-China principle is a consensus of the international community. He also urged the US to stop the bill from becoming a law and carefully handle affairs related to Taiwan.Such a bullying act is doomed to fail as it aims to reverse the overwhelming trend of severing ""diplomatic ties"" with the island of Taiwan and switching diplomatic recognition to China based on the one-China principle, and Taiwan people should know that the US always acts in its own interests and the island's benefits are never within the US consideration, Yang Lixian, a research fellow at the Beijing-based research center of cross-Straits relations, told the Global Times on Thursday.According to the bill, the US government should consider helping Taiwan maintain ""allies"" around the world, supporting Taiwan's membership in international institutions and engaging in bilateral trade negotiations with the island.Phrases used in the text of the bill, including ""as appropriate,"" shows that such a bill can be viewed merely as a move by Congress to pressure the executive branch, which is mainly symbolic, and at best, sends a seemingly supportive message to the self-deceiving island secessionists, Xin Qiang, deputy director of the center for US studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, told the Global Times on Thursday.A previous version of the bill was passed by the US Senate in October 2019. Because the House of Representatives slightly altered the content of the bill, the Senate will need to pass it again before it is sent to the US President's desk to become law.Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, reiterated at a press conference in October 2019 that China resolutely opposes US interference in Taiwan and the country's internal affairs by passing a series of so-called Taiwan-related bills.The Taiwan authorities' pursuit of ""diplomatic ties"" is nothing but a daydream and will never happen, Ma told the media.Observers also noted that whether talks over a FTA can be held would depend on the executive branch of the government, and the single Congress act will have little effect on the matter.Xin predicted that the since the idea of the FTA goes against US President Donald Trump's strong protectionist policies, such talks and implementation will not happen any time soon.

"Mainland’s large-scale infrared thermometer use intrigues Taiwan residentsn File photo: Xinhua The use of infrared thermometer in supermarkets and residential communities in the Chinese mainland in the wake of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak have tickled the curiosity of some Taiwan residents, local media reported.In many cases, measurers in the mainland simply point these infrared thermometers toward over people's wrists instead of their foreheads.Such temperature screening is rarely seen in Taiwan Province as measuring one's forehead is much more common in public places, Taipei-based news website chinatimes.com reported Saturday.The temperature of people's forehead is less stable than that of their wrists, as the forehead is usually exposed externally and affected by the environment, explained Wu Jian, director of the temperature and humidity laboratory under the Beijing Institute of Metrology.""Wrists, by contrasts, have relatively stable temperature as they are covered by sleeves most of the time in winters,"" Wu told the Global Times Monday.It is more accurate to check temperatures of the body parts that are covered with clothes such as wrists or necks, Feng Luzhao, a research fellow at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, stated in a press release issued on February 16.Minimize the errorInfrared forehead thermometers - gun-like handheld devices being pointed at foreheads or other body parts, including wrists for just two or three seconds to measure temperatures, are widely used in the mainland during the fight against the epidemic.Compared with traditional mercury thermometers that have to be put under people's arm for minutes, forehead thermometers are more convenient, time-saving and sanitized, Wu said.Nonetheless, forehead thermometers are less precise than mercury ones as they could vary with environmental influences.""Temperature being tested by a forehead thermometer may be lower in cold weather than it actually is,"" Wu said, adding that it's preferable to use forehead thermometers at ambient temperatures between 15 and 35 degrees (another version: between 10 and 40 degrees).Since the temperatures in many regions are still below 15 or 10 degrees, especially in the early mornings, Wu suggests measurers warm the forehead thermometers with heating pads or warm-water bags to keep them as accurate as possible outdoors.Another way of minimizing the reading error is to measure a single person's temperature with both a forehead thermometer and a mercury thermometer at the same time, Wu added.The two different figures being showed by the two thermometers will provide an error margin. ""By taking the margin into account, we can try to compensate the error when taking temperatures with forehead thermometers,"" he said. "	2/24/20	0	0	-0.7083	-1

Photo: Li Hao/GT As the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) is striving to enhance its combat readiness and preparing for military conflicts, potentially against Taiwan secessionists and US provocations, the PLA Army announced its plan to procure a whopping 1.4 million units of high-quality body armor with plates for a top limit price of about 13 billion yuan ($1.85 billion) in the coming two years, which is expected to keep PLA casualty numbers as low as possible.According to the 2019 edition of China's defense white paper, the PLA has about two million personnel, and the PLA Army is only a part of it, meaning every frontline army soldier could get one of these armor suits, with extra in reserve, analysts said.The PLA Army is holding open tenders to procure 930,000 units of plates for universal bulletproof vests and 467,000 units of plates for enhanced bulletproof vests, according to two statements released on weain.mil.cn, the Chinese military's weapon and equipment procurement website, on Friday.A regular plate unit should cost under 7,950 yuan, or 7.4 billion yuan in total, and an enhanced unit less than 12,900 yuan, or 6 billion yuan in total.Each plate unit consists of two bulletproof plates, and the plate manufacturer will assemble the plates into the vests, which are not included in these procurements, before delivery.The products will be delivered in batches in the 24 months after contracts are signed. Both open tenders will end on March 6, according to the statements.Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday that the procurement had the lives of Chinese soldiers in mind, as the armor can keep casualties to a minimum.The PLA is conducting more and more real-combat oriented training and drills, and the soldiers should always wear body armor as if they were in a real war to make the exercises more real, Song said.Chinese body armor is of high quality and relatively low cost, Song said, noting that about 70 percent of the international body armor market is made up of Chinese products.Some mainland military enthusiasts on the internet speculated that the procurement might aim at threat from Taiwan secessionists and their US supporters. They said armor plates' effectiveness expires in several years, so buying so many in such a short time period could mean preparations for potential military conflicts against Taiwan secessionist forces and other imminent threats in coming years.The statements did not mention the purpose of the procurements.

It will become modern in 2035 and become world-class by the mid-21st century, the Xinhua News Agency reported.February gave people a glimpse of what the Air Force has developed into over recent years, the expert said, noting that more advanced aircraft like the J-20 will likely enter service in the rest of 2020.

"HK, Taiwan retrieving residents from quarantined ship in JapannPhoto taken on Feb. 6, 2020 shows the ""Diamond Princess"", a cruise ship which has been kept in quarantine, waiting for supplies at the port of Yokohama in Japan. (Kyodo News via Xinhua) China's Hong Kong and Taiwan are bringing back all their residents from a quarantined cruise ship in Japan after 621 people on board have been infected with the COVID-19.The Global Times confirmed with some Hong Kong passengers that they, as scheduled, disembarked from the ship Diamond Princess on Wednesday.The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government announced on Tuesday that they have sent a second batch of 36 officers to bring back residents on the ship after a 30-member team arrived in Japan to make arrangements.The government demanded that the Japanese side arrange for Hong Kong passengers who tested negative for COVID-19 to leave the ship on Wednesday, and provide information of residents on board who had close contact with confirmed cases and subject to an extended quarantine period, the government announcement said.Eight medical personnel from Hong Kong joined the operation.Returning Hong Kong passengers were advised to stay at the quarantine center in order to minimize the health risks to their families and the community, the government noted.There were 352 Hong Kong residents on board and 50 confirmed infections as of Tuesday.Taiwan island's deputy representative to Japan is making arrangements to send their residents on the ship back to Taiwan, Taiwan media reported.The residents would stay at a hotel before taking a chartered plane back to Taiwan. They will be quarantined at a hospital for 14 days and transferred to an epidemic examination station if tested negative for the virus twice.Five of the 24 Taiwan residents on board have tested positive for the virus as of Tuesday, Taiwan media said.On Wednesday, another 79 people on board were tested positive for the novel coronavirus, taking the total number to 621 and about one sixth of all people on board, according to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.The Japanese government has sent infectious disease professionals and psychological counselors to the ship, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare told the Global Times on Wednesday, denying infectious disease expert Kentaro Iwata's accusation in a video that said the ministry failed to send professionals to help control the epidemic on the ship and led to the spread of the virus and the loss of timely treatment opportunities.Iwata published the video on Tuesday after entering the ship.The ministry noted that most people on board would go back home after disembarking; some people who had close contact with the patients would stay at facilities arranged by the Japanese government for a 14-day quarantine and go home if they test negative for the virus afterwards.Japan is taking active moves against the epidemic and large-scale infections are unlikely to happen in the country, said the ministry.A Japanese passenger, who gave his name as Daxa, told the Global Times on Wednesday that he is still on the ship waiting for the test results.Daxa said he cannot get off the ship on Wednesday, but he did not feel worried as he believes he was not infected. With 24,400 followers on Twitter, he updates his life on the ship on the platform.Daxa said the only thing that bothered him is the slow process to return home.The ship, which has 3,711 passengers and staff on board and arrived at the port of Yokohama in Japan on February 3, has been kept in quarantine after a passenger from Hong Kong was found to be infected with the virus.According to a report by Japanese media outlet NHK on Wednesday, about 500 passengers would disembark on Wednesday, and the rest are scheduled to leave on Friday.Japan has reported 694 infections by Wednesday, making it the country with the largest number of infections outside China.

"Some in West weaponize rumors to attack ChinanTom Cotton Photo: Screengrab of a New York Times report There's a clamor around the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic.Just after the Wuhan Institute of Virology denied Sunday the raging rumors claiming that the first person infected with the novel coronavirus came from the institute, another false information became rampant on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo, saying that a senior researcher of the institute, as a real-name ""whistleblower,"" reported the virus was released by the institute's director general Wang Yanyi.On Monday, in addition to the institute's new statement dispelling rumors, Weibo also confirmed that the rumormonger's internet protocol address was outside the Chinese mainland.In fact, since the beginning of the epidemic, such ridiculous rumors have been flooding China from abroad. In particular, some US politicians have exploited the virus outbreak to attack the Chinese government and system, which has worsened the public opinion environment and fueled the spread of rumors.For instance, since the outbreak of this epidemic, US Senator Tom Cotton has constantly claimed that the coronavirus came from a ""super laboratory"" in Wuhan. Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai has refuted this absurd allegation, saying conspiracy theories also exist about the coronavirus originating from the US. But Cotton, and many anti-China people like him, have never ceased their hostility against China.They have viewed the epidemic a ""golden opportunity"" to stir up trouble. Their evil intentions are so obvious that everyone with rationality can clearly see that.When the Chinese government and people are going all out to curb the spread of the virus, they either spread fear by alleging the epidemic is getting out of hand, or launch groundless attacks, saying that China's prevention and control measures are a violation of human rights.When China interacts with the international community well, they either turn a blind eye, or alleged that the praises China earned from other countries and even the World Health Organization were due to China's pressure on them.Cui has already proven that speculation and rumors are ""dangerous."" ""For one thing, this will create panic. Another is that it will fan racial discrimination and xenophobia, and all these things will really harm our joint efforts to combat the virus.""But these ill-disposed people will never listen. Perhaps, these consequences are exactly what they are glad to witness. The epidemic for them is not a crisis which needs the entire world's cooperation to resolve, but a political tool for them to contain China, just like the Huawei issue, Hong Kong riot s, Taiwan question, and Xinjiang governance. All they want is to drive a wedge between the Chinese government and people, disrupt China's social order, and tarnish the country's image in the international community.In the face of these sinister people and their malicious rumors, China should on the one hand resolutely fight back, showing people both abroad and at home what is really happening in the country; on the other, the country must keep focusing on its own development, growing strong enough until they shut up.

"Hit TV drama sparks debate on how teenagers identify and accept themselvesnTourists view the Taipei 101 skyscraper, a landmark in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan, Jan. 2, 2017. (Xinhua/Zhu Xiang) Someday or One Day, a hit time-travel TV series from the island of Taiwan, has swept social media with its entertaining plots and high production quality, also sparking rampant discussion about how teenagers can identify and accept themselves no matter who they are.The TV series, first broadcast on November 17, 2019 has a 9.2/10 on Chinese media review platform Douban to become one of the top hit TV dramas on the same platform.The drama tells a time travelling romance story in which a 27-year-old woman’s soul enters the body of 18-year-old high school student Chen Yunru after being hit by a car and then falls in love with her schoolmate. But more mysteries and conspiracies arrive as she continues to live in a world from 11 years ago.Can true love find a way to bridge a seemingly insurmountable time gap?Netizens have been sucked in by the TV show’s twisting and unpredictable storylines, regarding it as a breakthrough for Taiwan’s romantic dramas.Each character in the TV series has their own distinct personality that has struck a chord with netizens. Many netizens have joined in on discussions on social media about how young people identify and accept themselves.“We should let our children know that not all young people can become brilliant like Huang Yuxuan (one of lead roles). If you are another Chen Yunru, just an ordinary and unsociable person, you are still able to stand tall and face the future with confidence and dignity,” one Sina Weibo user commented.“When we were younger, most of us may have been Chen Yunru. The scriptwriter and director of this TV drama are conveying a message to us, telling us not to deny ourselves and embrace our true selves,” another netizen wrote.Some audiences associated the story with social problems such as excessive facial plastic surgery.“Some young women, even teenage girls, have had plastic surgery many times because they cannot accept what they look like and feel ashamed,” Wan Fen, a fan of the drama in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday.“They think they can gain confidence after becoming beautiful, but pursuing beauty is an endless road. This is an unhealthy mental state.”Wan said that accepting one’s true self can make people more confident and that this is a truely effective method that can allow people to become more beautiful.Other roles in the TV series have a variety of problems that confuse them such as disabilities and different gender orientations and they all isolate themselves to one extent or another.Shi Wenxue, a film critic as well as a teacher at the Beijing Film Academy, told the Global Times on Tuesday that tolerance is a very important part of society for young people.“How to recognize and accept one’s mediocrity, imperfection and differences from others, and how to break down stereotypes, these all need tolerance throughout the entirety of society,” Shi said.“Society should allow everyone to become who they are and find a place for everyone.”TV shows and films are good channels to inspire the public to reflect on and work to improve some social problems.Better Days, a film also focusing on teenagers that exposes the dark world of bullying and the social pressure to achieve that is facing today’s youth, helped raise concern toward school bullying on Chinese social media.The film, which has an 8.3/10 on Douban, earned 12 nominations at the 39th Hong Kong Film Awards, according to a newly released nomination list from the awards.

"Taiwan adds two novel coronavirus infection cases with first deathnDoctors check the CT image of a patient's lungs at Leishenshan (Thunder God Mountain) Hospital in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province, Feb. 9, 2020. (Photo by Gao Xiang/Xinhua) Taiwan confirmed two new COVID-19 cases, bringing the total number to 20, and reported the first death caused by the epidemic, the island's epidemic monitoring agency said Sunday.One of the two new cases was a man in his 60s living in central Taiwan who had cough on Jan. 27 and had been diagnosed pneumonia and hospitalized since Feb. 3. He died of pneumonia and septicemia on Feb. 15, according to the agency at a press conference.Since the man had not left Taiwan before he was ill nor have close contacts with any confirmed infection cases, he had not been subject to the novel coronavirus infection test until his death, the agency said.The case was identified due to a large-scale review of serious flu-like cases dating back to Jan. 31, launched by the island's health authorities. A total of 113 cases had been put for novel coronavirus infection tests since Feb. 12 and only this one was confirmed, the agency said.The authorities are investigating the actual infection source of the man, who allegedly had been a taxi driver.The other new infection case is a male relative of the deceased man, who has had no symptoms as of now and stayed in an isolation ward, the agency said.The authorities have identified 79 people having close contacts with the two men.

"Taiwan entertainers facing boycott on island after slamming authorities over mainland mask bannBarbie Hsu, known as “Big S”. Photo: VCG Some entertainers from Taiwan are facing a boycott from netizens in the island after donating masks to the Chinese mainland and slamming the Taiwan authority's decision not to export masks to the mainland amid the coronavirus outbreak.Barbie Hsu, known as ""Big S"", her sister Dee Hsu (Little S) and Christine Fan are the three that drew the strongest criticism. According to reports from the island, their comments have jarred many Taiwan netizens, who called for a backlash against products endorsed by these entertainers and left malicious comments under their personal Facebook pages and companies' accounts.Global Times found that hundreds of netizens commented on the Facebook page of Helena Rubinstein in Taiwan, threatening to boycott their products if they did not change their brand spokesman Dee Hsu.""I will never buy your products if Little S is still your product spokesman,"" read a typical Taiwan netizen's comment, which received many thumbs-up.A brand spokesperson for Helena Rubinstein told the Global Times on Thursday that she did not know about the issue and will inform the company for further comments.Netizens from Taiwan also demanded that GENQUO, a clothing brand established by Christine Fan, leave the Taiwan market, after a since-deleted Facebook post by Fan slamming Su Tseng-chang, the chief of Taiwan's executive body, who announced the mask ban, as an ""inhuman bastard.""The topic of boycotting GENQUO on Facebook was liked by more than 400 netizens.The cosmetic brand La Roche-Posay in Taiwan said on Facebook in late January that it has not used a brand spokesman since 2018. However, photos show images of Christine Fan printed on one of their posters in January 2019, prompting netizens to speculate that the brand is trying to distance itself from her.The Taiwan authority announced in late January a one-month ban on the export of specialist masks for medical personnel, saying the needs of local residents are their priority. As of Thursday, the island had confirmed 18 cases of coronavirus infection, with one recovered. The number of infected people in the mainland is about 60,000.The ban has sparked a huge wave of controversy inside Taiwan, with many slamming the DPP authority led by Tsai Ing-wen, including Taiwan's former leader Ma Ying-jeou.""We are all human beings. It's worse than the virus if we don't help each other and are without love,"" Little S commented on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo.""We should put aside antagonism and help each other when facing crises… I hope my kid understands the humanitarian spirit and doesn't become a bastard [like the DPP authority],"" Big S said on Weibo, after some revealed that she had donated 10,000 masks to Wuhan.Global Times found that although Big S has not posted any comment on Facebook since November 19, 2019, in which she said, ""Let's pass our love to more people who are needed,"" her previous posts were swarmed by some Taiwan netizens with hundreds of insulting comments.""Your support for China (mainland) is heartless and ugly,"" read one typical example.

"Taiwan should use the epidemic to improve cross-Straits ties, not make things worsenLogo of World Health Organization The outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia constitutes the first important event for cross-Straits relations following Tsai Ing-wen's victory in the Taiwan island's regional election. Unfortunately, judging from Tsai and her team's response, it appears they have chosen to exploit the ongoing epidemic for political gains. The Tsai authorities and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have not handled the crisis to safeguard common well-being on both sides of the Straits. Of course, this comes as no surprise. During the early stages of the outbreak, the Tsai authorities banned facemask exports to the Chinese mainland and then prohibited people from Hubei Province, the epidemic's center, from entering the island province. Taiwan also suspended most flights across the Straits for more than two months and implemented entry restrictions on non-Taiwan residents who had visited the Chinese mainland within 14 days. Amid a major health crisis, the first thing Taiwan leaders did was restricting cross-Straits exchanges. Taiwan has yet to provide any support to the mainland in its fight against the virus. On the mainland, combating the epidemic has become a cardinal task. The mainland has ensured that Taiwan people who are infected are receiving equal treatment. It has also helped arrange charter flights for Taiwan residents on the mainland so they can return home. So far, 247 Taiwan residents have been sent back to the island. Although Tsai acknowledged on Facebook the mainland's assistance, both her and the DPP have yet to reciprocate. When a Taiwan passenger had a fever after returning home, Taiwan officials launched groundless attacks against the mainland, claiming such arrangements were ""unsatisfactory."" In Taiwan, it seems politics is placed above humanity. As the mainland goes all out in its fight against the epidemic, the Tsai authorities are pushing for the island's participation in the World Health Organization (WHO), claiming Taiwan's absence from the organization ""creates a serious gap in the global health network"" and has ""caused countless errors in the handling"" of the coronavirus outbreak. At WHO's executive board meetings earlier this month, Taiwan officials used their ""diplomatic allies,"" including Swaziland and Paraguay, to promote Taiwan-related issues, claiming the island has limited access to WHO International Health Regulations. While visiting the US on February 3, Tsai's running mate Lai Ching-te exaggerated the threat Taiwan faces amid the outbreak and sought US support for their entry into WHO. In fact, the island can obtain global public health emergency information released by WHO, which can also be notified of emergencies in Taiwan in a prompt manner. Obstacles do not exist in areas pertaining to technical cooperation between the island of Taiwan and the WHO. During the outbreak, the mainland continuously provided Taiwan with information on the epidemic, shared relevant information, and arranged Taiwan experts to conduct field inspections in Wuhan. The WHO is a specialized UN agency composed of sovereign states. The Tsai authorities' call for participation must be resolved through cross-Straits negotiations under the one-China principle. However, the island's external affairs authority spokeswoman said the one-China principle was ""fictitious"" and ""political extortion against the people of Taiwan."" The Taiwan authorities have turned a blind eye to the consensus held by the international community in adhering to the one-China principle and not recognizing the island as a country. Under the one-China principle, Taiwan's participation in intergovernmental organizations concerns China's sovereignty. When Ma Ying-jeou was in power, the island participated in the World Health Assembly as an observer for eight consecutive years. Why is this situation hard to sustain? The crux of the problem is that the DPP refuses to recognize the 1992 Consensus, undermines cross-Straits relations, and instead creates cross-Straits confrontation. Although some countries, including the US, Japan, and Canada, verbally supported Taiwan's participation in the WHO as an observer, and Washington even passed some Taiwan-related bills, the effect of such efforts are limited. Taiwan's engagement in international affairs cannot circumvent the mainland. The Tsai authorities have attempted to use the ongoing epidemic to expand ""diplomatic space."" Secessionist forces within the island view the epidemic as a ""golden opportunity"" for Taiwan to join the WHO. They have misjudged the situation and are doomed to fail. The best thing for the Tsai authorities would be to focus on the epidemic. Playing political tricks is harmful to cross-Straits relations and runs counter to the interests of the Taiwan people.

"PLA conducts drills near Taiwan island for 2 days in a rownA Su-30 fighter jet attached to a naval aviation brigade under the PLA Eastern Theater Command takes off during the air combat confrontation training in southeast China’s Zhejiang province on February 5, 2020. (eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Li Hengjiang) The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) on Monday launched joint drills featuring naval and air forces near the island of Taiwan, one day after it conducted a combat readiness drill which saw its warplanes encircle the island.For two consecutive days, concentrated military operations surrounding Taiwan have demonstrated PLA's capabilities to solve the Taiwan question by force amid Taiwan secessionist plans, experts said.Naval and air forces with the PLA Eastern Theater Command on Monday conducted joint drills in the southeastern waters of the island of Taiwan, said Senior Colonel Zhang Chunhui, a PLA Eastern Theater Command spokesperson, in a statement released by the Ministry of National Defense on Monday.Citing Taiwan's defense authority, Taiwan news website udn.com reported on Monday that PLA aircraft including H-6 bombers and fighter jets crossed the Bashi Channel on Monday morning flying into the western Pacific, and returned on the same course.The joint drills on Monday came only one day after PLA forces conducted a combat readiness drill on Sunday with warships, bombers, jet fighters, and early warning aircraft. The combat planes cruised through the Bashi Channel and Miyako Strait and conducted real combat-oriented training.Unlike Sunday's operation, PLA fighter jets crossed the ""middle line"" of the Taiwan Straits on Monday, udn.com said.Song Zhongping, a mainland military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Monday the concentrated PLA drills are not only warnings to Taiwan secessionists, but also demonstrations of PLA capabilities to solve the Taiwan question by force.The recent drills on Monday mainly focused on real-combat scenarios including air-to-land assault and fire support, which trained and tested troop capabilities in joint operations, said Zhang.Song said these trainings are real-combat oriented and will be useful in potential battles against Taiwan's military force.Taiwan secessionist forces are disregarding the greater national interests, intensifying its scheme pursuing ""independence,"" going against the trend and the will of the people, Zhang said, noting that the PLA Eastern Theater Command troops are always on high alert, closely following the situation and are ready to resolutely fulfill its missions.An authoritative source who declined to be named told the Global Times after the first operation on Sunday that Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party has been increasingly colluding with the US, attempting with the US to confront the Chinese mainland, planning Lai Ching-te's US visit, seeking ""independence.""

"PLA’s patrol encircling Taiwan island sends stern warning to secessionists: sourcenPhoto: Xinhua The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Sunday organized warships and warplanes in a combat readiness patrol, with aerial forces crossing through the Bashi Channel and Miyako Strait, a move that an authoritative source said was sending a stern warning to Taiwan secessionists.The PLA's move at the moment also showed that mainland military capabilities were hindered not one jot by the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak and its will to safeguard national unity has never been undermined under any circumstance, Chinese mainland analysts also said.Naval and aerial forces of the PLA Eastern Theater Command systematically organized warships, bombers, fighters and early warning aircraft in a patrol on Sunday in which the troops tested their joint operation capability, said Senior Colonel Zhang Chunhui, a spokesperson for the PLA Eastern Theater Command, in a statement released on Sunday.During the mission, the aerial forces cruised through the Bashi Channel and Miyako Strait and conducted real combat-oriented training, Zhang said.Taiwan and its affiliated islands are inalienable parts of China, and the Chinese military's combat-readiness patrol was a completely legitimate and necessary action aimed at the current security situation in the Taiwan Straits and safeguarding national sovereignty, the spokesperson said.The troops were determined and capable of crushing any ""Taiwan secessionist"" activities, resolutely safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity and peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, Zhang said. The straightforward comment from the spokesperson stating that the patrol targeted Taiwan secessionists is rather rare as usually the mainland military authorities may address such a move as a routine arrangement according to the annual schedule, analysts said.Zhang's statement came after the Taiwan defense authority said Sunday that the PLA sent J-11 fighter jets, H-6 bombers and KJ-500 early warning aircraft through the Bashi Channel into Western Pacific and then through the Miyako Strait, returning to their bases in a route that circled the island from its eastern side, according to Taiwan news website udn.com.An authoritative source who declined to be named told the Global Times that Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party has been increasingly colluding with the US, attempting with the US to confront the Chinese mainland, planning Lai Ching-te's US visit, seeking ""independence,"" and the PLA action is a stern warning in response to that.The Taiwan authorities are also leveraging the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) outbreak to clamor for joining the World Health Organization (WHO), even claiming the NCP information related to Taiwan provided to the WHO by the mainland is false, and also prohibiting all people from the mainland visiting the island, despite the mainland's efforts in helping Taiwan residents in the mainland return home.Mainland military expert Peng Guangqian told the Global Times on Sunday that since Tsai Ing-wen was reelected as Taiwan's regional leader, her ambition for ""Taiwan independence"" has further expanded and become increasingly undisguised, which is making cross-Straits relations drift away from solidarity.""We have always been pursuing a peaceful reunification, but now it seems our sincerity for peace will not get proper responses from Taiwan.

The Taiwan secessionist forces are already on a road of no return and the possibility for a peaceful reunification is becoming less and less,"" Peng said.PLA latest actions are a show of its will to safeguard national unity, Peng said, noting that the PLA Eastern Theater Command is the closest theater command to the Taiwan Straits and its combat area covers the Straits, as it will become the main force in the reunification process.The PLA possesses military strength much more powerful than the island, and the combat-readiness patrol meant it was ready for combat, another military expert who asked not to be named told the Global Times.The ongoing coronavirus outbreak has had little impact on PLA capabilities, as the PLA is highly disciplined, experienced in preventing infectious diseases among the troops and possesses expertise in biological defense, the expert said.

"Despicable Taiwan authorities make ill use of coronavirusnLogo of World Health Organization Jaushieh Joseph Wu, leader of Taiwan's external affairs authority, tweeted Thursday attacking the World Health Organization (WHO), saying ""What's wrong with you?"" The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority got so exasperated simply because WHO has adhered to its principles.While the Chinese people are going all out to fight the epidemic, the DPP authority and Taiwan independence forces are taking it as an opportunity to push the island's participation in WHO and expand its so-called diplomatic space. These are all efforts to push for Taiwan independence.Both sides across the Taiwan Straits are at a peak period of the epidemic. But the DPP authority has put aside the extremely urgent epidemic situation and started playing political tricks. It is thus clear that the well-being of Taiwan people means nothing to them. The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council on Thursday warned the DPP authority that exploiting the epidemic to seek ""Taiwan independence"" is doomed to fail.The DPP authority has always been good at acting. Their excuse this time is that the island of Taiwan was prevented from receiving timely information about the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. But WHO told the Global Times that the organization has always maintained communications with the Taiwan authority through channels stipulated by the International Health Regulations ever since the outbreak, and experts from the island have fully engaged in all the consultations. What the WHO had said was a real slap on the face of Taiwan authorities.According to another source, the Chinese mainland has also repeatedly informed Taiwan of the latest information on the epidemic situation in a timely manner and has arranged site inspections for Taiwan experts to visit Wuhan in January.Although the lie had been exposed, the DPP authorities did not feel ashamed. Instead, they turned outraged and pointed an accusing finger at the WHO. This is really bizarre!As a matter of fact, the obstacles the DPP is confronting on the path of participating in WHO activities are built by the DPP itself. The WHO is a specialized agency of the United Nations and only sovereign states can obtain its membership. When it comes to Taiwan's participation in any international organization, relevant issues must be resolved under the one-China principle.From 2009 to 2016, Taiwan participated in the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer in the name of ""Chinese Taipei,"" thanks to cross-Straits consultations based on mutually adhering to the 1992 Consensus that embodies the one-China principle. However, after the DPP came into office in May 2016, it has been refusing to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus. Because of this, the DPP shut itself out of the WHO.It is a matter of principle. That being said, the DPP can hardly make any breakthrough via despicable means.The epidemic situation on the island of Taiwan is pressing and the DPP's unwise response to it has heightened the tension. On January 24, DPP authorities announced a ban on the island's export of masks. But right now, Taiwan is running out of masks. Some police cannot even be allocated one mask every day. Yet certain DPP city council members gave away thousands of masks for free as a tactic to win more votes. This made us breathless with anxiety for our compatriots in Taiwan while sparing no effort to fight the epidemic ourselves.We advise the DPP authority: The epidemic is a life-and-death matter which cannot afford any mistakes. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and the people of Taiwan are our compatriots. We will never allow the DPP authority to bring disaster to the Taiwan people. "	2/7/20	1	1	-0.6971	-1
"Mainland spokesperson slams Taiwan's DPP for banking on foreign forces to build itself upnA citizen runs in front of the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan, on Oct. 1, 2019. (Xinhua/Chen Bin) A Chinese mainland spokesperson on Tuesday slammed Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority for banking on foreign forces to build itself up.Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, made the remarks when responding to a question about Lai Ching-te's visit to the United States.The one-China principle is the fundamental precondition and political foundation for China to develop relations with all other countries, including the United States, Ma said.""We firmly oppose any form of official visits between Taiwan and countries that have diplomatic relations with us,"" Ma said, urging the United States to adhere to the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques.""We once again warn the DPP authority that 'Taiwan independence' is a counter-current and a dead end,"" Ma said. ""Anyone or any force that attempts to bank on foreign forces to build itself up will become the victim of its own evil deeds. "	2/5/20	0	0	-0.128	-1

"Tsai’s WHO call ‘repetitive manipulation’nPhoto: Screenshot of WHO press conference on Jan 23 RELATED ARTICLES: WHO decision makes little effect in curbing China Observers in the Chinese mainland said that Tsai Ing-wen's ""repetitive"" political manipulation is doomed to fail, after the Taiwan regional leader cried out for Taiwan to join the World Health Organization (WHO) but snubbed the mainland regarding medical cooperation and banned mask exports amid the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak.Tsai made her voice public on Twitter since Thursday, saying that ""we hope that the WHO will not exclude Taiwan for political reasons,"" and ""Taiwan's absence from the WHO creates a serious gap in the global network.""According to reports, Tsai's comments received support from certain anti-China politicians such as Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz in the US, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.In a reply to an email from the WHO to the Global Times on Sunday, the organization denied that Taiwan was excluded from the world health network which was indicated by Tsai, saying the organization is collaborating closely with Taiwan authorities through the International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanism in response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak.Experts from Taiwan were involved in all of the WHO's consultations - clinical networks, laboratory networks, and other multiple health fronts - so they are fully engaged and aware of all of the developments in the expert networks, the WHO told Global Times in the email, noting that throughout 2019, experts from Taiwan were invited to attend WHO technical meetings.The island of Taiwan is ineligible to join the WHO in any way, as the organization under the UN only allows participation from sovereign states, and Taiwan is regarded as part of China, said a Beijing-based political commentator who requested anonymity.The commentator called Taiwan's trickery as repetitive which was doomed to fail, as the secessionist stance of Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is unwelcome to the world.Tsai also drew criticism inside the island after her administration imposed a ban on mask exports to the mainland amid the outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei Province. Some said Taiwan authorities should show more empathy.Ma Ying-jeou, Taiwan's former leader, said on Friday through a Facebook post that Tsai's government should ""put off political calculations,"" and be duty-bound to assist the mainland in controlling the coronavirus, which would also benefit Taiwan residents.According to Ma, the Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan have signed a cooperation agreement in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases a decade ago, during Ma's tenure.During the 2009 to 2016 period, Taiwan participated in the World Health Assembly（WHA） as an observer under the name of ""Chinese Taipei"" for eight consecutive years, until Tsai replaced Ma in 2016.The expert said that this shows the importance of adhering to the ""one-China principle."" If not, Taiwan will be abandoned by the international community.""From the case of the mask ban we can see the irresponsibility of Taiwan authorities. They don't lack medical information or international cooperation, what they want is to create antagonism across the Taiwan Straits and expand its 'international space,'"" said the expert, noting that the same trick was used in the 2003 SARS epidemic.

"Showdown unlikely in Tsai’s 2nd term: expertnWang Zaixi Photo: Li Hao/GT Douglas Paal Photo: Li Hao/GT Taiwan regional election concluded Saturday with Tsai Ing-wen being re-elected the leader of the island. How should Beijing ensure the ""one-China"" principle is upheld and continue to hold the initiative in guiding cross-Straits relations? The Global Times () invited mainland expert Wang Zaixi (), former deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, and Douglas Paal (), vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace of the US, to comment on these issues.Tsai's re-election means the relationship across the straits would be fully caught in a stalemate. There is no more possibility in the upcoming four years to improve it. The Chinese mainland and Taiwan would go through a period of cold confrontation.Since Tsai represents the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), she will govern the island according to DPP's guidelines, which include promoting Taiwan secession. During her first term in office, Tsai refused to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus or the ""one-China"" principle. She will hardly change her stance after winning the second term.But I don't think the two sides across the straits would head toward a showdown. China's reunification is a long process yet the initiative is in the hands of the Chinese mainland. Be it the size of land, population, GDP, military or technological strength, Taiwan and the Chinese mainland are not on the same level.Even if Tsai won't give up her pro-secession banner and I assume she will continue to promote ""de-sinicization,"" striving to lead Taiwan further away from the mainland, she does not dare to do so too fast or too unscrupulously, given the Anti-Secession Law and the bottom lines included in it. That's why in her press conference after the re-election, she emphasized, ""my commitment to peaceful, stable cross-Straits relations remains unchanged."" Her dream is to promote Taiwan secession under stable ties with the mainland one small step at a time. In doing so hastily, she will meet the fate of her predecessor Chen Shui-bian.Therefore, cross-Straits relations can hardly be improved, but Tsai dare not go too far.Relations between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, and ties between China and the US, are completely different in nature. Although the two sides across the Taiwan Straits have not realized reunification in over 70 years, this has not changed a bit the fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.That being said, there is no way for the two sides across the Straits to decouple. Regardless of which party is in power, be it the DPP or the Kuomintang (KMT), the leader would face the same issue. The island of Taiwan cannot leave the mainland.Then why there are still many people on the island who are clamoring for Taiwan secession? This is because the DPP's strategy has been demonizing the Chinese mainland and the Communist Party of China to win more votes. It has been hyping up that Taiwan will have no democracy or freedom after reunification, making young Taiwan people afraid of the mainland. Unfortunately, radical protests broke out in Hong Kong before the Taiwan election , which have later been utilized by the DPP.It is undeniable that the young people of Taiwan are having a weakening sentiment over the Chinese nation. It is not the young people to be blamed. Over the past two decades, Taiwan's textbooks have completely become pro-secession materials, which define China as a foreign country, poetry of the Tang and Song Dynasty as foreign literature.Tsai knows she cannot realize political secession or de facto secession, so she is now promoting cultural secession.To begin with, we can explore the potential of using the internet such as WeMedia in this regard, to clarify the consequences of Taiwan secession as well as long-term benefits that reunification can bring to Taiwan people.Second, close contacts are needed, especially people-to-people exchanges. We should provide more chances for young Taiwan people to study, get medical treatment, and find jobs on the mainland and opportunities for mainlanders to visit Taiwan.Third, Chinese culture is an important link between compatriots on both sides of the straits. I have noticed that pro-secession forces have been thinking hard about ways to realize Taiwan secession culturally. We should now consider how to carry forward and promote Chinese culture on the island.Fourth, economic integration is vital. When economic interests across the straits are inextricably interwoven with each other, secession will become more difficult.Fifth, military deterrence against pro-secession forces in Taiwan is necessary. In recent years, we often witness aircraft carriers passing through the straits and fighter jets flying around the island. I think this is helpful. It can warn and prevent the Taiwan separatists from going too far.Late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping once noted, China adheres to seeking the solution to the Taiwan question by peaceful means, but it has never given up the possibility of using non-peaceful means, China cannot make such a commitment. Later, Deng's philosophy was more frequently summarized into ""peaceful reunification,"" while not giving up the use of force was mentioned relatively rarely for some time.Peaceful reunification is a goal China has been striving for. It is an option, but not the only option. Peaceful reunification requires coordination from both sides. Yet the DPP refuses to even recognize the ""one-China"" principle, then how can it possibly negotiate with the Chinese mainland over peaceful reunification?There is a worrying trend in Taiwan today. Pro-secession forces have grown stronger and have become the ruling party from being an opposition force. Under such circumstances, while adhering to the policy of peaceful reunification, China must also be prepared to resolve this issue through non-peaceful means as a last resort. This is the reason why China made the Anti-Secession Law.From the perspective of the latest result of Taiwan election, the KMT has not lost its base.Then why did Tsai win a landslide victory in the end? This is because the majority of moderate voters and members of small parties, which have no ""presidential"" candidates, cast their votes for Tsai. The KMT lost the support of the moderate middle.The KMT recognizes the 1992 Consensus and opposes Taiwan secession. However, the party is now facing severe challenges.It is lack of unity. During the election campaign over the past year, the KMT failed to integrate itself until its final campaign rally on January 9. How can it win the fight if it is spending too much time and energy on uniting the team?The KMT is aging, be its leadership team, party members or voters. It can no longer attract the youth any more. This is fatal. Without young people in the team, the party is losing its vitality.More importantly, the KMT has lost its direction. In terms of cross-Straits ties, it said nothing else other than repeating ""there is but one China in the world, with each side having its own interpretation for it"" during the campaign. A political party that has no specific ideal, no goal, and no guidelines, will naturally have no way out.I still believe that the KMT, as an anti-secession force on the island of Taiwan, will exist for a long time in the future. However, if it hopes to stage a comeback, drastic reforms must be carried out.Those policies have to be continued. The attempt to win the hearts and minds of people should not be treated as utilitarian business.Uniting people and gaining support is supposed to be the Communist Party of China's special skill. But in Taiwan, the skill has not been efficient. I think we need to reflect on, adjust our methods and mind-set, and not to give up just because the work is difficult.I think US President Donald Trump is already gradually breaking the policy.In December 2016, when then president-elect Trump had not yet been inaugurated, he took a phone call from Tsai and congratulated her on becoming ""president."" This is a sensitive political issue because the US and Taiwan are not supposed to have any official relationship.After Trump assumed office, US Congress has passed a series of Taiwan-related laws. In 2016, the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances were reaffirmed as US policy toward Taiwan in a resolution passed by the US Senate. The Taiwan Relations Act states that the US ""shall provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character… enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capacity."" This is a complete violation of the ""one-China"" policy. The Six Assurances, issued by former US president Ronald Reagan in 1982, is more absurd. It states that the US would not consult with China in advance over US arms sales to Taiwan, and the US would not set a date for termination of arms sales to Taiwan. Worse, it also claims the US would not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. Previously, these articles were informal assurance. But the current US administration wrote it into a formal resolution in black and white.Later, US Congress passed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages visits between the US and Taiwan at all levels; Taiwan Assurance Act of 2019, which states the US ""should conduct regular sales and transfers of defense articles to Taiwan;"" and the National Defense Authorization Act, which encourages establishing ""high-level, interagency"" cybersecurity working group with Taiwan.The four legislations completely challenged the bottom line of the ""one-China"" principle, openly interfering in China's domestic affairs. Although there are three China-US joint communiqués, the US believes its own domestic law outweighs international treaties. In this sense, how do you think of whether the US has broken through the ""one-China"" policy?To try to contain China's development and peaceful rise, the US will play its Taiwan card more frequently in the years to come. In doing so, it will cost Washington little, but can create quite a few disturbances in China.When it comes to Taiwan election this time, I still believe there is no need to care too much about who wins and who loses. Electoral pendulum is often observed in Taiwan elections. That Tsai secured a second term does not mean the DPP has won the heart of Taiwan people. During Tsai's first term in office, she had no political achievements on social governance. She won because the KMT was facing severe internal problems.Yet the DPP is unskilled in governing the island. Its shortcomings will be exposed in the years to come and people will know better. Taiwan's nine-in-one local election is an example. Personally, I think the Taiwan People's Party and its chairman Ko Wen-je will be a promising candidate in the 2024 Taiwan regional leadership election.It's always possible that there will be major changes, but my belief is that the US will slowly try to increase the cooperation between the US and Taiwan in both formal and informal ways, because Taiwan is viewed favorably politically in the US because of its political system and successful democracy, and also because it's seen as a partner in stabilizing Asia-Pacific at a time when China's rise is destabilizing the region in the views of the US.I think she's very careful in her administration, not just in the first term, but I expect her to be as careful in her second term.The first reason is that's her character. She is a very cautious person. She doesn't do things rashly.Second, why would she need to do that? She has been re-elected. There is no more election coming. So she doesn't have to take dramatic steps to protect her political position. She is very secure.Third, the people around her who might want to push for Taiwan independence or manifestations toward Taiwan independence are not in charge. She will be in charge. So I I'm not very worried about Taiwan being a source of instability in the triangle of US-Taiwan-Chinese relations.Taiwan has always done more poorly economically and otherwise when the US and the Chinese mainland have tensions. The room is smaller. So I think Taiwan would like to see that the US and the Chinese mainland stabilize their relationship. It is not looking for worsening relations, but that is not the direction we are going in now. So Taiwan has to be very careful to protect its own interests as the US and the Chinese mainland pursue very different agendas in the Asia-Pacific region.By the way, I don't think Taiwan is being a troublemaker or springing surprises. Its representation in Washington is very conscious about preventing surprises and informing the US in advance of what Taiwan plans to do. The current mechanism is working quite well.It's not impossible, but I think the US has no interest in getting into a conflict over Taiwan. I think China has much bigger issues. It has a long-term interest in reunification, but that's a long-term interest, not a short-term interest. So on the present horizon, I don't see sources of direct conflict over Taiwan. But accidents can happen. Someday some things might take place that would then escalate tensions very dramatically. Hopefully the kind of mechanisms that are in place now will prevent that from happening.Part of this could help a lot if China would accept more informal but effective communications with the Tsai government - the way it did with the Ma Ying-jeou government previously - that would help to prevent surprises and frictions from getting out of hand.The US does not want to pay a military price for Taiwan. But if it must, to defend its interests and the Taiwan Relations Act requirements to provide for the self-defense of Taiwan, it will.And there's a very strong determination in the American Congress, I think, in the administration as well, to do what's necessary to protect Taiwan. Hopefully we will never get to that point, because the Chinese mainland, the US and Taipei will all understand there are some things you do not do, because they will force the other parties to conflict. And we will try to avoid doing that.I think this is like a ceasefire. It's like the ceasefire in Korea in 1953. The war will not end, but it will not be a shooting war in the economic world for the next year while the US goes through its elections and we all get ready for whatever follows after our elections in November.I think decoupling across the board is not possible. Decoupling in the world of science and technology is. China already started to decouple by closing the internet and preventing Google, Facebook, the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal from operating in China. So it started in China and it's probably going to continue in these sensitive areas.But broader decoupling is very hard. And even in the world of science and technology, in academic research and fundamental research, it's very hard to draw lines between good research in Chinese universities and good research in Western universities.China-US relations are not an issue in the American election right now, and I don't think they will be, unless something surprising happens. People are more interested in our domestic economic condition and want to see progress of medical care, social security, education, and issues of that nature.I think there is a fairly broad consensus among both American political parties that the US and China need to go through a period of readjustment of our relationship. Democrats might disagree about the way Trump's making his adjustments of policy, but I don't think they disagree with the need for adjustment.By moving toward greater friction, I still think that the consequences of conflict between the US and China are so great that neither the leadership in the US nor the leadership in China would be willing to take that risk.Even in the US where there is a very strong wave of criticism of Chinese behavior and activity, you have noticed recently that the practical suggestions from people who would be policymakers and future governments are becoming more moderate and reasonable. They too recognize that the conflict between the US and China would be a devastation for the 21st century.I think the best way is for the two sides to speak together in detail on many issues across the board. Not talking to each other is very unhelpful and is the fastest way to get to misjudgment. But careful and patient listening to the other side's comments and then offering one's own comments on what that side has to say is a far better way of avoiding misjudgments.We've got frictions in the South China Sea and the East China Sea. The US and China are developing nuclear and non-nuclear capabilities. We've got cyber and space mechanisms now. All of these would be good topics for discussion.Plus humanitarian issues like, for example, managing the current outbreak in Wuhan with cooperation from the US CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] or National Institutes of Health might help contain such disease.And we have just announced that there will be a continuing economic dialogue. I think that is an important feature as well. "	1/15/20	1	1	0.9998	1

I have noticed that pro-secession forces have been thinking hard about ways to realize Taiwan secession culturally. We should now consider how to carry forward and promote Chinese culture on the island.Fourth, economic integration is vital. When economic interests across the straits are inextricably interwoven with each other, secession will become more difficult.Fifth, military deterrence against pro-secession forces in Taiwan is necessary. In recent years, we often witness aircraft carriers passing through the straits and fighter jets flying around the island. I think this is helpful. It can warn and prevent the Taiwan separatists from going too far.Late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping once noted, China adheres to seeking the solution to the Taiwan question by peaceful means, but it has never given up the possibility of using non-peaceful means, China cannot make such a commitment. Later, Deng's philosophy was more frequently summarized into ""peaceful reunification,"" while not giving up the use of force was mentioned relatively rarely for some time.Peaceful reunification is a goal China has been striving for. It is an option, but not the only option. Peaceful reunification requires coordination from both sides. Yet the DPP refuses to even recognize the ""one-China"" principle, then how can it possibly negotiate with the Chinese mainland over peaceful reunification?There is a worrying trend in Taiwan today. Pro-secession forces have grown stronger and have become the ruling party from being an opposition force. Under such circumstances, while adhering to the policy of peaceful reunification, China must also be prepared to resolve this issue through non-peaceful means as a last resort. This is the reason why China made the Anti-Secession Law.From the perspective of the latest result of Taiwan election, the KMT has not lost its base.Then why did Tsai win a landslide victory in the end? This is because the majority of moderate voters and members of small parties, which have no ""presidential"" candidates, cast their votes for Tsai. The KMT lost the support of the moderate middle.The KMT recognizes the 1992 Consensus and opposes Taiwan secession. However, the party is now facing severe challenges.It is lack of unity. During the election campaign over the past year, the KMT failed to integrate itself until its final campaign rally on January 9. How can it win the fight if it is spending too much time and energy on uniting the team?The KMT is aging, be its leadership team, party members or voters. It can no longer attract the youth any more. This is fatal. Without young people in the team, the party is losing its vitality.More importantly, the KMT has lost its direction. In terms of cross-Straits ties, it said nothing else other than repeating ""there is but one China in the world, with each side having its own interpretation for it"" during the campaign. A political party that has no specific ideal, no goal, and no guidelines, will naturally have no way out.I still believe that the KMT, as an anti-secession force on the island of Taiwan, will exist for a long time in the future. However, if it hopes to stage a comeback, drastic reforms must be carried out.Those policies have to be continued. The attempt to win the hearts and minds of people should not be treated as utilitarian business.Uniting people and gaining support is supposed to be the Communist Party of China's special skill. But in Taiwan, the skill has not been efficient. I think we need to reflect on, adjust our methods and mind-set, and not to give up just because the work is difficult.I think US President Donald Trump is already gradually breaking the policy.In December 2016, when then president-elect Trump had not yet been inaugurated, he took a phone call from Tsai and congratulated her on becoming ""president."" This is a sensitive political issue because the US and Taiwan are not supposed to have any official relationship.After Trump assumed office, US Congress has passed a series of Taiwan-related laws. In 2016, the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances were reaffirmed as US policy toward Taiwan in a resolution passed by the US Senate. The Taiwan Relations Act states that the US ""shall provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character… enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capacity."" This is a complete violation of the ""one-China"" policy. The Six Assurances, issued by former US president Ronald Reagan in 1982, is more absurd. It states that the US would not consult with China in advance over US arms sales to Taiwan, and the US would not set a date for termination of arms sales to Taiwan. Worse, it also claims the US would not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. Previously, these articles were informal assurance. But the current US administration wrote it into a formal resolution in black and white.Later, US Congress passed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages visits between the US and Taiwan at all levels; Taiwan Assurance Act of 2019, which states the US ""should conduct regular sales and transfers of defense articles to Taiwan;"" and the National Defense Authorization Act, which encourages establishing ""high-level, interagency"" cybersecurity working group with Taiwan.The four legislations completely challenged the bottom line of the ""one-China"" principle, openly interfering in China's domestic affairs. Although there are three China-US joint communiqués, the US believes its own domestic law outweighs international treaties. In this sense, how do you think of whether the US has broken through the ""one-China"" policy?To try to contain China's development and peaceful rise, the US will play its Taiwan card more frequently in the years to come. In doing so, it will cost Washington little, but can create quite a few disturbances in China.When it comes to Taiwan election this time, I still believe there is no need to care too much about who wins and who loses. Electoral pendulum is often observed in Taiwan elections. That Tsai secured a second term does not mean the DPP has won the heart of Taiwan people. During Tsai's first term in office, she had no political achievements on social governance. She won because the KMT was facing severe internal problems.Yet the DPP is unskilled in governing the island. Its shortcomings will be exposed in the years to come and people will know better. Taiwan's nine-in-one local election is an example. Personally, I think the Taiwan People's Party and its chairman Ko Wen-je will be a promising candidate in the 2024 Taiwan regional leadership election.It's always possible that there will be major changes, but my belief is that the US will slowly try to increase the cooperation between the US and Taiwan in both formal and informal ways, because Taiwan is viewed favorably politically in the US because of its political system and successful democracy, and also because it's seen as a partner in stabilizing Asia-Pacific at a time when China's rise is destabilizing the region in the views of the US.I think she's very careful in her administration, not just in the first term, but I expect her to be as careful in her second term.The first reason is that's her character. She is a very cautious person. She doesn't do things rashly.Second, why would she need to do that? She has been re-elected. There is no more election coming. So she doesn't have to take dramatic steps to protect her political position. She is very secure.Third, the people around her who might want to push for Taiwan independence or manifestations toward Taiwan independence are not in charge. She will be in charge. So I I'm not very worried about Taiwan being a source of instability in the triangle of US-Taiwan-Chinese relations.Taiwan has always done more poorly economically and otherwise when the US and the Chinese mainland have tensions. The room is smaller. So I think Taiwan would like to see that the US and the Chinese mainland stabilize their relationship. It is not looking for worsening relations, but that is not the direction we are going in now. So Taiwan has to be very careful to protect its own interests as the US and the Chinese mainland pursue very different agendas in the Asia-Pacific region.By the way, I don't think Taiwan is being a troublemaker or springing surprises. Its representation in Washington is very conscious about preventing surprises and informing the US in advance of what Taiwan plans to do. The current mechanism is working quite well.It's not impossible, but I think the US has no interest in getting into a conflict over Taiwan. I think China has much bigger issues. It has a long-term interest in reunification, but that's a long-term interest, not a short-term interest. So on the present horizon, I don't see sources of direct conflict over Taiwan. But accidents can happen. Someday some things might take place that would then escalate tensions very dramatically. Hopefully the kind of mechanisms that are in place now will prevent that from happening.Part of this could help a lot if China would accept more informal but effective communications with the Tsai government - the way it did with the Ma Ying-jeou government previously - that would help to prevent surprises and frictions from getting out of hand.The US does not want to pay a military price for Taiwan. But if it must, to defend its interests and the Taiwan Relations Act requirements to provide for the self-defense of Taiwan, it will.And there's a very strong determination in the American Congress, I think, in the administration as well, to do what's necessary to protect Taiwan. Hopefully we will never get to that point, because the Chinese mainland, the US and Taipei will all understand there are some things you do not do, because they will force the other parties to conflict. And we will try to avoid doing that.I think this is like a ceasefire. It's like the ceasefire in Korea in 1953. The war will not end, but it will not be a shooting war in the economic world for the next year while the US goes through its elections and we all get ready for whatever follows after our elections in November.I think decoupling across the board is not possible. Decoupling in the world of science and technology is. China already started to decouple by closing the internet and preventing Google, Facebook, the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal from operating in China. So it started in China and it's probably going to continue in these sensitive areas.But broader decoupling is very hard. And even in the world of science and technology, in academic research and fundamental research, it's very hard to draw lines between good research in Chinese universities and good research in Western universities.China-US relations are not an issue in the American election right now, and I don't think they will be, unless something surprising happens. People are more interested in our domestic economic condition and want to see progress of medical care, social security, education, and issues of that nature.I think there is a fairly broad consensus among both American political parties that the US and China need to go through a period of readjustment of our relationship. Democrats might disagree about the way Trump's making his adjustments of policy, but I don't think they disagree with the need for adjustment.By moving toward greater friction, I still think that the consequences of conflict between the US and China are so great that neither the leadership in the US nor the leadership in China would be willing to take that risk.Even in the US where there is a very strong wave of criticism of Chinese behavior and activity, you have noticed recently that the practical suggestions from people who would be policymakers and future governments are becoming more moderate and reasonable. They too recognize that the conflict between the US and China would be a devastation for the 21st century.I think the best way is for the two sides to speak together in detail on many issues across the board. Not talking to each other is very unhelpful and is the fastest way to get to misjudgment. But careful and patient listening to the other side's comments and then offering one's own comments on what that side has to say is a far better way of avoiding misjudgments.We've got frictions in the South China Sea and the East China Sea. The US and China are developing nuclear and non-nuclear capabilities. We've got cyber and space mechanisms now. All of these would be good topics for discussion.Plus humanitarian issues like, for example, managing the current outbreak in Wuhan with cooperation from the US CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] or National Institutes of Health might help contain such disease.And we have just announced that there will be a continuing economic dialogue. I think that is an important feature as well. "	1/15/20	1	1	0.9998	1
"Mainland will thwart Taiwan’s bid for secessionnPhoto:VCG US role has been central in getting Tsai Ing-wen re-elected in Taiwan regional leadership elections on Saturday. Her re-election will significantly impact future China-US relations. It is foreseeable that US-Taiwan ties will see a marked improvement and Washington is going to play the ""Taiwan card"" more actively, which will intensify the strategic competition between China and the US over the Taiwan question.Bluntly intervening in the Taiwan leadership elections, US spared no effort to help Tsai win. In June 2019, both Cory Gardner, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, and William Brent Christensen, director of Taipei office of the American Institute in Taiwan, accompanied Tsai to visit Taipei's Dadaocheng area, which was just like canvassing for her.In 2019, the US also upgraded arms sale to Taiwan, including approving selling 66 F16 fighter jets to the island. Tsai's administration took this chance to vociferously hype up close relations with the US.As soon as the results of the election were announced, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo congratulated Tsai, and Christensen also met her on January 12.Many analysts believe that the island's election is a contest of influence between the Chinese mainland and the US. They argue that the US publicly supports Tsai to secure its control of Taiwan and ensure that the island can continue to play a role in checking the Chinese mainland. Predictably, for a long time, the strategic competition between China and the US will not end, but keep escalating.As the core issue in China-US relations, the Taiwan question has long been considered a trump card by Washington to gain leverage over Beijing. As long as the island is led by a completely pro-US leader, Washington can always exploit the Taiwan card.Compared with Tsai, Han Kuo-yu, the Kuomintang candidate, is more independent and concerned about Taiwan's future from the perspective of Taiwan's interests rather than that of the US. Hence, the White House won't allow him to be Taiwan leader.While the US intervened in the elections, the Chinese mainland has been following the principle of non-interference in the affairs of Taiwan. The mainland is committed to the one-China principle, opposing ""Taiwan secession,"" deepening cross-Straits economic integration and development, and promoting peaceful reunification of the country. The mainland doesn't care much about who is the Taiwan leader, but pays more attention to the leader's cross-Straits policy.As she declared victory in Taipei, Tsai said cross-Straits relations should be based on ""peace, parity, democracy and dialogue."" Although the words sound benign, they harbor implications of ""Taiwan secession"" and a sense of confrontation.""Peace"" is good, but not all wars are unjust. Wars to achieve national reunification and defend territorial integrity are righteous. Tsai's attempts to prevent the Chinese mainland from safeguarding its sovereignty under the banner of peace will prove futile. In Tsai's dictionary, ""parity"" is a synonym of ""Taiwan secession."" Taiwan is a part of China and it cannot be placed on an equal footing with China.With ""democracy,"" Tsai implies the different values across the Straits to reject reunification. ""Dialogue"" is the right way to resolve divergence, but there is a precondition for dialogue between the mainland and Taiwan - the mainland will not hold dialogues with secessionists. Cross-Straits dialogues must be conducted under the premise that Taiwan adheres to the 1992 consensus.In the future, if Tsai continues to advocate ""Taiwan secession"" activities, challenge the Chinese mainland, and deepen ties with the US by serving as Washington's pawn, the situation across the Taiwan Strait will deteriorate substantially. I believe that the Chinese mainland, with a strong economy and military power, will take any possible measure to strongly resist and respond to any action of Washington and Taiwan that endangers peace across the Taiwan Strait.Yin Maoxiang is a PhD candidate at the School of International Studies, Renmin University of China.

Photo:Xinhua Adhering to the 1992 Consensus that embodies the one-China principle is the unshakable foundation for the peaceful and stable development of relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, a mainland spokesperson said Wednesday.Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks at a regular press conference while asked to comment on remarks regarding cross-Strait ties made by Tsai Ing-wen, the Democratic Progressive Party candidate, following her win in Saturday's Taiwan leadership election.Ma said ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist forces and their activities are the biggest threat to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the greatest scourge to the interests and wellbeing of people on both sides of the Strait and must be resolutely curbed.The tide of the times -- the cross-Strait situation moving toward peace and stability and cross-Strait relations continuing to move forward -- cannot be stopped by any force or anyone, he said.""The future of Taiwan lies in national reunification and the wellbeing of the people in Taiwan hinges on the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,"" the spokesman said. ""Taiwan is the Taiwan of all Chinese people, including Taiwan compatriots, and Taiwan's future is jointly decided by all Chinese people,"" he added.When asked to comment on Tsai's remarks regarding ""one country, two systems,"" Ma said ""peaceful reunification"" and ""one country, two systems"" have remained the mainland's fundamental principles toward Taiwan over the past 40 years.""Different systems are not obstacles to reunification, nor are they excuses for secession,"" Ma said.""Peaceful reunification"" and ""one country, two systems"" are the fundamental guideline for seeking a solution to the Taiwan question and are the best approach to realizing national reunification, he said.""One country, two systems"" will be practiced in Taiwan in a manner that gives full consideration to the island's actual conditions, the opinions and suggestions of various circles on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, as well as the interests and feelings of Taiwan compatriots, he said.

"Showdown unlikely in Tsai’s 2nd term: expertnWang Zaixi Photo: Li Hao/GT Douglas Paal Photo: Li Hao/GT Taiwan regional election concluded Saturday with Tsai Ing-wen being re-elected the leader of the island. How should Beijing ensure the ""one-China"" principle is upheld and continue to hold the initiative in guiding cross-Straits relations? The Global Times () invited mainland expert Wang Zaixi (), former deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, and Douglas Paal (), vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace of the US, to comment on these issues.Tsai's re-election means the relationship across the straits would be fully caught in a stalemate. There is no more possibility in the upcoming four years to improve it. The Chinese mainland and Taiwan would go through a period of cold confrontation.Since Tsai represents the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), she will govern the island according to DPP's guidelines, which include promoting Taiwan secession. During her first term in office, Tsai refused to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus or the ""one-China"" principle. She will hardly change her stance after winning the second term.But I don't think the two sides across the straits would head toward a showdown. China's reunification is a long process yet the initiative is in the hands of the Chinese mainland. Be it the size of land, population, GDP, military or technological strength, Taiwan and the Chinese mainland are not on the same level.Even if Tsai won't give up her pro-secession banner and I assume she will continue to promote ""de-sinicization,"" striving to lead Taiwan further away from the mainland, she does not dare to do so too fast or too unscrupulously, given the Anti-Secession Law and the bottom lines included in it. That's why in her press conference after the re-election, she emphasized, ""my commitment to peaceful, stable cross-Straits relations remains unchanged."" Her dream is to promote Taiwan secession under stable ties with the mainland one small step at a time. In doing so hastily, she will meet the fate of her predecessor Chen Shui-bian.Therefore, cross-Straits relations can hardly be improved, but Tsai dare not go too far.Relations between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, and ties between China and the US, are completely different in nature. Although the two sides across the Taiwan Straits have not realized reunification in over 70 years, this has not changed a bit the fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.That being said, there is no way for the two sides across the Straits to decouple. Regardless of which party is in power, be it the DPP or the Kuomintang (KMT), the leader would face the same issue. The island of Taiwan cannot leave the mainland.Then why there are still many people on the island who are clamoring for Taiwan secession? This is because the DPP's strategy has been demonizing the Chinese mainland and the Communist Party of China to win more votes. It has been hyping up that Taiwan will have no democracy or freedom after reunification, making young Taiwan people afraid of the mainland. Unfortunately, radical protests broke out in Hong Kong before the Taiwan election , which have later been utilized by the DPP.It is undeniable that the young people of Taiwan are having a weakening sentiment over the Chinese nation. It is not the young people to be blamed. Over the past two decades, Taiwan's textbooks have completely become pro-secession materials, which define China as a foreign country, poetry of the Tang and Song Dynasty as foreign literature.Tsai knows she cannot realize political secession or de facto secession, so she is now promoting cultural secession.To begin with, we can explore the potential of using the internet such as WeMedia in this regard, to clarify the consequences of Taiwan secession as well as long-term benefits that reunification can bring to Taiwan people.Second, close contacts are needed, especially people-to-people exchanges. We should provide more chances for young Taiwan people to study, get medical treatment, and find jobs on the mainland and opportunities for mainlanders to visit Taiwan.Third, Chinese culture is an important link between compatriots on both sides of the straits. I have noticed that pro-secession forces have been thinking hard about ways to realize Taiwan secession culturally. We should now consider how to carry forward and promote Chinese culture on the island.Fourth, economic integration is vital. When economic interests across the straits are inextricably interwoven with each other, secession will become more difficult.Fifth, military deterrence against pro-secession forces in Taiwan is necessary. In recent years, we often witness aircraft carriers passing through the straits and fighter jets flying around the island. I think this is helpful. It can warn and prevent the Taiwan separatists from going too far.Late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping once noted, China adheres to seeking the solution to the Taiwan question by peaceful means, but it has never given up the possibility of using non-peaceful means, China cannot make such a commitment. Later, Deng's philosophy was more frequently summarized into ""peaceful reunification,"" while not giving up the use of force was mentioned relatively rarely for some time.Peaceful reunification is a goal China has been striving for. It is an option, but not the only option. Peaceful reunification requires coordination from both sides. Yet the DPP refuses to even recognize the ""one-China"" principle, then how can it possibly negotiate with the Chinese mainland over peaceful reunification?There is a worrying trend in Taiwan today. Pro-secession forces have grown stronger and have become the ruling party from being an opposition force. Under such circumstances, while adhering to the policy of peaceful reunification, China must also be prepared to resolve this issue through non-peaceful means as a last resort. This is the reason why China made the Anti-Secession Law.From the perspective of the latest result of Taiwan election, the KMT has not lost its base.Then why did Tsai win a landslide victory in the end? This is because the majority of moderate voters and members of small parties, which have no ""presidential"" candidates, cast their votes for Tsai. The KMT lost the support of the moderate middle.The KMT recognizes the 1992 Consensus and opposes Taiwan secession. However, the party is now facing severe challenges.It is lack of unity. During the election campaign over the past year, the KMT failed to integrate itself until its final campaign rally on January 9. How can it win the fight if it is spending too much time and energy on uniting the team?The KMT is aging, be its leadership team, party members or voters. It can no longer attract the youth any more. This is fatal. Without young people in the team, the party is losing its vitality.More importantly, the KMT has lost its direction. In terms of cross-Straits ties, it said nothing else other than repeating ""there is but one China in the world, with each side having its own interpretation for it"" during the campaign. A political party that has no specific ideal, no goal, and no guidelines, will naturally have no way out.I still believe that the KMT, as an anti-secession force on the island of Taiwan, will exist for a long time in the future. However, if it hopes to stage a comeback, drastic reforms must be carried out.Those policies have to be continued. The attempt to win the hearts and minds of people should not be treated as utilitarian business.Uniting people and gaining support is supposed to be the Communist Party of China's special skill. But in Taiwan, the skill has not been efficient. I think we need to reflect on, adjust our methods and mind-set, and not to give up just because the work is difficult.I think US President Donald Trump is already gradually breaking the policy.In December 2016, when then president-elect Trump had not yet been inaugurated, he took a phone call from Tsai and congratulated her on becoming ""president."" This is a sensitive political issue because the US and Taiwan are not supposed to have any official relationship.After Trump assumed office, US Congress has passed a series of Taiwan-related laws. In 2016, the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances were reaffirmed as US policy toward Taiwan in a resolution passed by the US Senate. The Taiwan Relations Act states that the US ""shall provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character… enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capacity."" This is a complete violation of the ""one-China"" policy. The Six Assurances, issued by former US president Ronald Reagan in 1982, is more absurd. It states that the US would not consult with China in advance over US arms sales to Taiwan, and the US would not set a date for termination of arms sales to Taiwan. Worse, it also claims the US would not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. Previously, these articles were informal assurance. But the current US administration wrote it into a formal resolution in black and white.Later, US Congress passed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages visits between the US and Taiwan at all levels; Taiwan Assurance Act of 2019, which states the US ""should conduct regular sales and transfers of defense articles to Taiwan;"" and the National Defense Authorization Act, which encourages establishing ""high-level, interagency"" cybersecurity working group with Taiwan.The four legislations completely challenged the bottom line of the ""one-China"" principle, openly interfering in China's domestic affairs. Although there are three China-US joint communiqués, the US believes its own domestic law outweighs international treaties. In this sense, how do you think of whether the US has broken through the ""one-China"" policy?To try to contain China's development and peaceful rise, the US will play its Taiwan card more frequently in the years to come. In doing so, it will cost Washington little, but can create quite a few disturbances in China.When it comes to Taiwan election this time, I still believe there is no need to care too much about who wins and who loses. Electoral pendulum is often observed in Taiwan elections. That Tsai secured a second term does not mean the DPP has won the heart of Taiwan people. During Tsai's first term in office, she had no political achievements on social governance. She won because the KMT was facing severe internal problems.Yet the DPP is unskilled in governing the island. Its shortcomings will be exposed in the years to come and people will know better. Taiwan's nine-in-one local election is an example. Personally, I think the Taiwan People's Party and its chairman Ko Wen-je will be a promising candidate in the 2024 Taiwan regional leadership election.It's always possible that there will be major changes, but my belief is that the US will slowly try to increase the cooperation between the US and Taiwan in both formal and informal ways, because Taiwan is viewed favorably politically in the US because of its political system and successful democracy, and also because it's seen as a partner in stabilizing Asia-Pacific at a time when China's rise is destabilizing the region in the views of the US.I think she's very careful in her administration, not just in the first term, but I expect her to be as careful in her second term.The first reason is that's her character. She is a very cautious person. She doesn't do things rashly.Second, why would she need to do that? She has been re-elected. There is no more election coming. So she doesn't have to take dramatic steps to protect her political position. She is very secure.Third, the people around her who might want to push for Taiwan independence or manifestations toward Taiwan independence are not in charge. She will be in charge. So I I'm not very worried about Taiwan being a source of instability in the triangle of US-Taiwan-Chinese relations.Taiwan has always done more poorly economically and otherwise when the US and the Chinese mainland have tensions. The room is smaller. So I think Taiwan would like to see that the US and the Chinese mainland stabilize their relationship. It is not looking for worsening relations, but that is not the direction we are going in now. So Taiwan has to be very careful to protect its own interests as the US and the Chinese mainland pursue very different agendas in the Asia-Pacific region.By the way, I don't think Taiwan is being a troublemaker or springing surprises. Its representation in Washington is very conscious about preventing surprises and informing the US in advance of what Taiwan plans to do. The current mechanism is working quite well.It's not impossible, but I think the US has no interest in getting into a conflict over Taiwan. I think China has much bigger issues. It has a long-term interest in reunification, but that's a long-term interest, not a short-term interest. So on the present horizon, I don't see sources of direct conflict over Taiwan. But accidents can happen. Someday some things might take place that would then escalate tensions very dramatically. Hopefully the kind of mechanisms that are in place now will prevent that from happening.Part of this could help a lot if China would accept more informal but effective communications with the Tsai government - the way it did with the Ma Ying-jeou government previously - that would help to prevent surprises and frictions from getting out of hand.The US does not want to pay a military price for Taiwan. But if it must, to defend its interests and the Taiwan Relations Act requirements to provide for the self-defense of Taiwan, it will.And there's a very strong determination in the American Congress, I think, in the administration as well, to do what's necessary to protect Taiwan. Hopefully we will never get to that point, because the Chinese mainland, the US and Taipei will all understand there are some things you do not do, because they will force the other parties to conflict. And we will try to avoid doing that.I think this is like a ceasefire. It's like the ceasefire in Korea in 1953. The war will not end, but it will not be a shooting war in the economic world for the next year while the US goes through its elections and we all get ready for whatever follows after our elections in November.I think decoupling across the board is not possible. Decoupling in the world of science and technology is. China already started to decouple by closing the internet and preventing Google, Facebook, the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal from operating in China. So it started in China and it's probably going to continue in these sensitive areas.But broader decoupling is very hard. And even in the world of science and technology, in academic research and fundamental research, it's very hard to draw lines between good research in Chinese universities and good research in Western universities.China-US relations are not an issue in the American election right now, and I don't think they will be, unless something surprising happens. People are more interested in our domestic economic condition and want to see progress of medical care, social security, education, and issues of that nature.I think there is a fairly broad consensus among both American political parties that the US and China need to go through a period of readjustment of our relationship. Democrats might disagree about the way Trump's making his adjustments of policy, but I don't think they disagree with the need for adjustment.By moving toward greater friction, I still think that the consequences of conflict between the US and China are so great that neither the leadership in the US nor the leadership in China would be willing to take that risk.Even in the US where there is a very strong wave of criticism of Chinese behavior and activity, you have noticed recently that the practical suggestions from people who would be policymakers and future governments are becoming more moderate and reasonable. They too recognize that the conflict between the US and China would be a devastation for the 21st century.I think the best way is for the two sides to speak together in detail on many issues across the board. Not talking to each other is very unhelpful and is the fastest way to get to misjudgment. But careful and patient listening to the other side's comments and then offering one's own comments on what that side has to say is a far better way of avoiding misjudgments.We've got frictions in the South China Sea and the East China Sea. The US and China are developing nuclear and non-nuclear capabilities. We've got cyber and space mechanisms now. All of these would be good topics for discussion.Plus humanitarian issues like, for example, managing the current outbreak in Wuhan with cooperation from the US CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] or National Institutes of Health might help contain such disease.And we have just announced that there will be a continuing economic dialogue. I think that is an important feature as well. "	1/15/20	1	1	0.9998	1
"Showdown unlikely in Tsai’s 2nd term: expertnWang Zaixi Photo: Li Hao/GT Douglas Paal Photo: Li Hao/GT Taiwan regional election concluded Saturday with Tsai Ing-wen being re-elected the leader of the island. How should Beijing ensure the ""one-China"" principle is upheld and continue to hold the initiative in guiding cross-Straits relations? The Global Times () invited mainland expert Wang Zaixi (), former deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, and Douglas Paal (), vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace of the US, to comment on these issues.Tsai's re-election means the relationship across the straits would be fully caught in a stalemate. There is no more possibility in the upcoming four years to improve it. The Chinese mainland and Taiwan would go through a period of cold confrontation.Since Tsai represents the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), she will govern the island according to DPP's guidelines, which include promoting Taiwan secession. During her first term in office, Tsai refused to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus or the ""one-China"" principle. She will hardly change her stance after winning the second term.But I don't think the two sides across the straits would head toward a showdown. China's reunification is a long process yet the initiative is in the hands of the Chinese mainland. Be it the size of land, population, GDP, military or technological strength, Taiwan and the Chinese mainland are not on the same level.Even if Tsai won't give up her pro-secession banner and I assume she will continue to promote ""de-sinicization,"" striving to lead Taiwan further away from the mainland, she does not dare to do so too fast or too unscrupulously, given the Anti-Secession Law and the bottom lines included in it. That's why in her press conference after the re-election, she emphasized, ""my commitment to peaceful, stable cross-Straits relations remains unchanged."" Her dream is to promote Taiwan secession under stable ties with the mainland one small step at a time. In doing so hastily, she will meet the fate of her predecessor Chen Shui-bian.Therefore, cross-Straits relations can hardly be improved, but Tsai dare not go too far.Relations between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, and ties between China and the US, are completely different in nature. Although the two sides across the Taiwan Straits have not realized reunification in over 70 years, this has not changed a bit the fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.That being said, there is no way for the two sides across the Straits to decouple. Regardless of which party is in power, be it the DPP or the Kuomintang (KMT), the leader would face the same issue. The island of Taiwan cannot leave the mainland.Then why there are still many people on the island who are clamoring for Taiwan secession? This is because the DPP's strategy has been demonizing the Chinese mainland and the Communist Party of China to win more votes. It has been hyping up that Taiwan will have no democracy or freedom after reunification, making young Taiwan people afraid of the mainland. Unfortunately, radical protests broke out in Hong Kong before the Taiwan election , which have later been utilized by the DPP.It is undeniable that the young people of Taiwan are having a weakening sentiment over the Chinese nation. It is not the young people to be blamed. Over the past two decades, Taiwan's textbooks have completely become pro-secession materials, which define China as a foreign country, poetry of the Tang and Song Dynasty as foreign literature.Tsai knows she cannot realize political secession or de facto secession, so she is now promoting cultural secession.To begin with, we can explore the potential of using the internet such as WeMedia in this regard, to clarify the consequences of Taiwan secession as well as long-term benefits that reunification can bring to Taiwan people.Second, close contacts are needed, especially people-to-people exchanges. We should provide more chances for young Taiwan people to study, get medical treatment, and find jobs on the mainland and opportunities for mainlanders to visit Taiwan.Third, Chinese culture is an important link between compatriots on both sides of the straits. I have noticed that pro-secession forces have been thinking hard about ways to realize Taiwan secession culturally. We should now consider how to carry forward and promote Chinese culture on the island.Fourth, economic integration is vital. When economic interests across the straits are inextricably interwoven with each other, secession will become more difficult.Fifth, military deterrence against pro-secession forces in Taiwan is necessary. In recent years, we often witness aircraft carriers passing through the straits and fighter jets flying around the island. I think this is helpful. It can warn and prevent the Taiwan separatists from going too far.Late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping once noted, China adheres to seeking the solution to the Taiwan question by peaceful means, but it has never given up the possibility of using non-peaceful means, China cannot make such a commitment. Later, Deng's philosophy was more frequently summarized into ""peaceful reunification,"" while not giving up the use of force was mentioned relatively rarely for some time.Peaceful reunification is a goal China has been striving for. It is an option, but not the only option. Peaceful reunification requires coordination from both sides. Yet the DPP refuses to even recognize the ""one-China"" principle, then how can it possibly negotiate with the Chinese mainland over peaceful reunification?There is a worrying trend in Taiwan today. Pro-secession forces have grown stronger and have become the ruling party from being an opposition force. Under such circumstances, while adhering to the policy of peaceful reunification, China must also be prepared to resolve this issue through non-peaceful means as a last resort. This is the reason why China made the Anti-Secession Law.From the perspective of the latest result of Taiwan election, the KMT has not lost its base.Then why did Tsai win a landslide victory in the end? This is because the majority of moderate voters and members of small parties, which have no ""presidential"" candidates, cast their votes for Tsai. The KMT lost the support of the moderate middle.The KMT recognizes the 1992 Consensus and opposes Taiwan secession. However, the party is now facing severe challenges.It is lack of unity.

"‘Reunification by force’ sentiment provoked by DPP: spokespersonnMa Xiaoguang, spokesperson of Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council The growing sentiment of reunifying the island of Taiwan by military force among some Chinese mainland netizens is a result provoked by actions of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Taiwan secessionist forces, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council said on Wednesday, urging the latter to introspect upon where they want to lead cross-Straits relations.Spokesperson Ma Xiaoguang reiterated at Wednesday's regular press conference that the mainland's policy toward Taiwan is consistent & clear, urging the DPP authority and Taiwan secessionist forces to reflect on why increasing voices emerge to urge ""reunification by military force"" among some mainland residents in the recent years.This sentiment is a result provoked by the actions of the DPP authority and Taiwan secessionists that went against the trend of the times, Ma said.Upholding the 1992 Consensus which reflects the adherence to the one-China principle is the ""unshakeable"" foundation for the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, Ma said.Taiwan secessionist forces and their actions are the biggest threat to the peace across the Straits, which should be contained, he said.

"Cross-Straits situation needs pragmatismnPhoto taken on June 20, 2019 shows the night view of Taipei. Photo: Xinhua Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen won by a landslide in the island's regional leadership elections, and her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took more than half of the ""legislative"" seats. We should interpret Taiwan's public opinion objectively to make sure our overall understanding of the Taiwan society is accurate.What Tsai and the DPP advocated most in the elections were repulsion of the Chinese mainland and rejection of the reunification. The election result shows that most people in Taiwan approve the political path based on such perceptions. In the current international context and the island's internal environment with the DPP in power, it is very hard to change such an ideology in Taiwan.Most voters supported the DPP, but this does not mean they are in favor of ""Taiwan independence."" ""Taiwan independence"" is impossible and it means unbearable risks to the island. This is a basic consensus of most people in Taiwan.Over the past few decades, the mainland has been developing rapidly and the cross-Straits power structure has been reshaped. Cross-Straits exchanges have increased, and economic and cultural integration has become a major trend. The real political theme across the Taiwan Straits has transited from opposing independence to promoting reunification. Taiwan authorities have taken some petty actions. This is a hasty resistance to such a trend.China's neighboring countries and regions have complicated feelings about its rise. In Taiwan, such feelings may become more prominent. The victory of Tsai and the DPP reflects some people's rising anxiety in the face of the mainland's rise. They are worried that the mainland's influence will influence the Straits even without reunification. The DPP has been instigating people's concerns over the political complexity brought by cross-Straits integration.It is true that the DPP is misleading Taiwan society, and that the US and Western forces are helping the DPP do so. In fact, the US has always been interfering in Taiwan's regional elections, but Taiwan society has never regarded US intervention as a major problem.After Tsai was reelected, some internal and external misinterpretations aimed at the mainland have emerged. And while integration across the Straits will be complicated, the general trend of closer cross-Straits ties cannot be reversed.Former Taiwan regional leader Lee Teng-hui created the Taiwan Straits crisis in 1996. When Chen Shui-bian was in office, relations across the Straits also went through massive changes. Yet, has the general trend of integration between the Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan been reversed? Have the two sides drifted from each other?The struggle across the Taiwan Straits will continue. Since it is not exclusive interactions between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland, and the US has forcefully intervened in it, the long-term strife is one of the most complicated problems in global geopolitical games. Who is elected is not a decisive factor in the struggle, yet it may influence the scenarios in the next phase. For the Chinese mainland, the most important thing will always be our strength and readiness. The election result is more of a test of the mainland's ability to cope with the changes.Eventually, cross-Straits reunification will be led by the Chinese mainland. Positive changes on Taiwan need to be started by the mainland. To finally achieve cross-Straits reunification, we need the determination and endurance to bear more pressure. "	1/13/20	0	0	0.9078	1
"Tsai urged to be more pragmaticnPhoto taken on July 21, 2019 from Xiangshan Mountain shows the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan. (Xinhua/Zhu Xiang) After Taiwan's incumbent regional leader Tsai Ing-wen swept a landslide victory in the island's regional elections on Saturday, senior officials from the UK and the US sent out congratulations with an intention of continuously playing ""Taiwan card"" in containing the Chinese mainland. However, Chinese mainland officials and analysts reiterated that any separatist attempts are doomed to fail.Tsai of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) beat Han Kuo-yu, candidate of Kuomintang (KMT) and Tsai's major rival, with a record-high 8.17 million votes, surpassing the total votes she won in the 2016 regional elections.In Tsai's speech after she declared the victory, Tsai reminded that ""peace, parity, democracy, and dialogue"" are the four key elements in cross-Straits relations, claiming that the Taiwan authority would not ""concede to threats and intimidation.""The Chinese mainland upholds the basic principles of peaceful reunification and ""one country, two systems"" as well as the one-China principle, resolutely safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson for the Beijing-based Taiwan Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said after the results of the elections came out.And the mainland's policy toward the island is consistent and clear. While endorsing the 1992 Consensus and opposing ""Taiwan independence,"" the mainland will work with Taiwan compatriots to continue to promote the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations and the peaceful reunification of the motherland, he noted.Some western officials showed their eagerness of continuing using ""Taiwan card"" as a way of containing the rise of the mainland by praising the elections ""as vibrant democracy,"" and even lauded Tsai for seeking so-called stability with the mainland. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo applauded Tsai's victory in an official statement released on Saturday, claiming the island made it ""a model for the Indo-Pacific region and a force for good in the world.""UK Foreign Office also lauded that the elections ""are testament to Taiwan's vibrant democracy.""

"Tsai urged to be more pragmaticnPhoto taken on July 21, 2019 from Xiangshan Mountain shows the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan. (Xinhua/Zhu Xiang) After Taiwan's incumbent regional leader Tsai Ing-wen swept a landslide victory in the island's regional elections on Saturday, senior officials from the UK and the US sent out congratulations with an intention of continuously playing ""Taiwan card"" in containing the Chinese mainland. However, Chinese mainland officials and analysts reiterated that any separatist attempts are doomed to fail.Tsai of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) beat Han Kuo-yu, candidate of Kuomintang (KMT) and Tsai's major rival, with a record-high 8.17 million votes, surpassing the total votes she won in the 2016 regional elections.In Tsai's speech after she declared the victory, Tsai reminded that ""peace, parity, democracy, and dialogue"" are the four key elements in cross-Straits relations, claiming that the Taiwan authority would not ""concede to threats and intimidation.""The Chinese mainland upholds the basic principles of peaceful reunification and ""one country, two systems"" as well as the one-China principle, resolutely safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson for the Beijing-based Taiwan Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said after the results of the elections came out.And the mainland's policy toward the island is consistent and clear. While endorsing the 1992 Consensus and opposing ""Taiwan independence,"" the mainland will work with Taiwan compatriots to continue to promote the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations and the peaceful reunification of the motherland, he noted.Some western officials showed their eagerness of continuing using ""Taiwan card"" as a way of containing the rise of the mainland by praising the elections ""as vibrant democracy,"" and even lauded Tsai for seeking so-called stability with the mainland.

"China can maintain one-China principlenA gathering to commemorate the 40th anniversary of issuing ""Message to Compatriots in Taiwan"" is held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 2, 2019. Photo: Xinhua/Pang Xinglei Some senior diplomats of Western countries, including the US and the UK, congratulated Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen and her Democratic Progressive Party on their victory in the island's regional leadership and legislative elections. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's speech of congratulation was more high-profile than that of former secretary of state John Kerry four years ago. They officially sent their congratulations, which is contrary to the one-China principle and sends a wrong signal to Taiwan authorities.The US, which has been regarding China as a strategic competitor, will get up to more little tricks on the Taiwan question in the coming years. The US will rope in more allies to help, and China must be fully prepared.China should firmly maintain the one-China principle and avoid being led by the US and Taiwan authorities. We should strive to hold the initiative of the Taiwan Straits in our own hands.First, we must strengthen the right to define the situation of the Taiwan Straits. The situation should not be decided by the US and Taiwan authorities. Our strategic arrangements should not be restrained by their definition. This means that we can ignore some of the messages that they want to highlight, and we can harshly stop the acts that they want to slip through unpunished.Second, if the US goes too far, we should resolutely counteract and prevent other Western countries from being coerced by the US. In the future, we must counter those Western countries that follow the US suit on the Taiwan question so as to further convince Western countries of our determination to maintain the one-China principle.Third, we should encourage Tsai to ease her cross-Straits policies and not to further antagonize the Chinese mainland. Meanwhile, we need to plan to crack down on Tsai's new provocative actions, including imposing military pressure, which is an unbearable option for Taiwan authorities.Fourth, we should carry out a stronger international promotion of the one-China principle and take the international moral high ground of the Taiwan question. The one-China principle is widely known to the world and has a strong moral foundation. The US and Taiwan authorities use the so-called democracy and Taiwan's public opinion to confront the principle, and the whole world understands their geopolitical malice. China has sufficient conditions to win the battle of public opinion. We need to make the world see who is unilaterally breaking the status quo of the Taiwan Straits and destroying its peace and stability.Fifth, we should make the Chinese mainland's popular public opinion - resolutely opposing the so-called Taiwan independence - join in the public opinion battle. Such public opinion from the Chinese mainland should gain respect from the international community. Taiwan authorities rashly undermine the one-China principle, which has already become a global consensus. They also oppose mainland public opinion. Taiwan authorities and their supporters are doomed to be isolated.The mainland should stay confident and become more united. We must not be led by some malicious public opinion created by some internal and external forces. Taiwan is an island close to the Chinese mainland, not a boat that is drifting away. As the comprehensive strength of the mainland has been increasing, we have enough ability to contain ""Taiwan independence."" This is a fact that even those ""Taiwan independence"" forces believe firmly. "	1/12/20	0	0	0.9927	1

"Taiwan prepares for regional electionsnHan Kuo-Yu (center), ""presidential candidate"" for Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party, is greeted by the supporters while visiting Chingan temple on the campaign trail in Keelung on Tuesday, ahead of the Sunday ""presidential"" and ""parliamentary"" elections. Photo: AFP Taiwan residents will head to the polls for the 2020 Taiwan elections on Saturday amid accusations of the mainland meddling and the influence of Hong Kong's social unrest. Facing increasing challenges in cross-Straits relations as ""Taiwan independence"" forces grow, Chinese mainland officials and analysts warned that reunification of the motherland is an inevitable trend regardless of who wins. The number of eligible voters for Taiwan's upcoming ""presidential"" and ""vice presidential"" election is 19.31 million, an increase of 528,114 from the 2016 contest, news website Taiwan Today reported on Wednesday, citing data from the Central Election Commission. The number of registered voters in 2016 was 18,782,991. Tsai Ing-wen and her running mate Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) are running against Han Kuo-yu and Chang San-cheng of the Chinese Kuomintang (KMT) party. In her fight to retain her ""presidency,"" Tsai, repeatedly referred to Hong Kong's social unrest as a cautionary tale for the island against the mainland, even creating a slogan: ""Hong Kong today, Taiwan tomorrow."" In light of Tsai's handling of cross-Straits relations over the past few years, Chinese mainland analysts said the upcoming elections in Taiwan remain complicated and would be more worrisome if she wins. The number of registered voters indicates that the running parties have fully mobilized their supporters and the election will be a face-off between party bases where Tsai could hold the advantage over other candidates, Jin Yi, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Wednesday. The result remains hard to predict, as alleged fake polls and disinformation also weigh on candidates, analysts said. To blame Beijing for meddling in the election was groundless as reunification is inevitable and the mainland will not see the election result as an important factor affecting this process. Hong Kong card Han, Tsai's opposing candidate from the 1992 Consensus-endorsing KMT, criticized his rival at a live TV debate on December 29 for using the blood of Hong Kong young people to favor her candidacy. ""Your vote is based on the bleeding body of the Hong Kong people, and you are exploiting their value,"" Han said, BBC reported. In her new campaign video, Tsai also highlighted so-called challenges that Hong Kong's young generation are facing during months of protests, undermining the ""one country, two systems"" principle. The video tells a one-sided story of Hong Kong unrest by focusing on so-called police brutality and is also part of the DPP's continuing efforts to incite anti-mainland sentiment, analysts said. ""Using the Hong Kong card has a very temporary influence, which also won't last long,"" Yang Lixian, a research fellow at the Beijing-based research center of cross-Straits relations, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Playing the Hong Kong card may not work out as expected, Yang said, as the Hong Kong situation is cooling and the US, too, has been shifting its attitude toward this matter. Meanwhile, the experts noted how the West has been hyping Chinese mainland efforts to ""infiltrate"" Taiwan's regional election, highlighted by the remarks of Wang Liqiang, a self-claimed spy defector who the mainland authorities showed in late November was a convicted fraudster. Wang told the Australian Intelligence Organization that the mainland offered 20 million yuan ($2.88 million) in support of Han's election bid. In December the US Senate gave final passage to the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, a provision of which mandates a report on any Chinese mainland interference in Taiwan's elections and regulates that the US Director of National Intelligence is required to submit the report to Congress within 45 days of the January 11 Taiwan election. Analysts also concluded that such developments could be gathered as evidence to illustrate that it was the US that has been trying to influence the regional election, rather than the Chinese mainland. Photo: Xinhua Future challenges While some Western media emphasized that the mainland's next crisis will be in the upcoming regional election, mainland analysts and officials reiterated how to deal with cross-Straits relations depends on the mainland's development, and the vote won't disrupt the pace of the reunification process. Liu Jieyi, director of the Beijing-based Taiwan Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said in his 2020 new year's speech that if the two sides could take on a peaceful development path, Taiwan compatriots could fully enjoy the benefits. Otherwise, confrontation and hostility across the Straits created by a tiny minority would harm the interests and benefits of Taiwan compatriots, he said. The bright prospects for the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations require the joint efforts of compatriots on both sides, which requires the Taiwan compatriots' correct choice, the senior official said, while noting that the trend toward reunification of the motherland was irresistible. Some expressed concerns that if Tsai wins the election, she could continue to promote anti-mainland sentiments and enact anti-mainland bills in exchange for US endorsement. ""The especially dangerous part is Tsai's likely increasing military reliance on the US, and that would challenge the bottom line of reunification, leading to military clashes and conflicts across the Taiwan Straits,"" said Jin.

"Taiwan incident might bring uncertainty to regional electionnThis handout picture released by the Yilan County Fire Department on Thursday shows rescuers searching for survivors after a Black Hawk military helicopter smashed into mountains near Taipei. Taiwan's ""chief of the general staff"" Shen Yi-ming was killed in the crash, the island's defense authority said, just days before the island goes to polls to elect a new regional leader. Photos: Xinhua Election impact The crash of a US-made Taiwan military helicopter on Thursday killed three senior officers including the ""chief of the general staff"" of the island's defense forces.Chinese mainland experts said that the frequent accidents relate to the unreliability of US-made vehicles and the island should not play a cash machine feeding Taiwan people's money to US defense industry giants.Due to the deadly crash happening nine days ahead of Taiwan's regional election, Chinese mainland observers opined that the investigation of the case might be used by politicians to serve their own interests at the election.A Taiwan military Black Hawk helicopter carrying 13 people including three senior military officers crashed in a mountainous area in northern Taiwan on Thursday, killing eight including the island's ""chief of the general staff"" Shen Yi-ming.Rescue personnel arrived at the crash site 1:30 pm and found five survivors of the severely damaged helicopter, a Taipei-based news website reported on Thursday.Shen and seven other people have been confirmed dead.Taiwan's defense authority confirmed that the Black Hawk lost contact with air control on Thursday morning and went down in the Wulai District of New Taipei City, Beijing-headquartered China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Thursday.The US-made helicopter had 13 passengers including three senior military officers, a journalist and crew, according to a press conference held by Taiwan's defense authority on Thursday morning, CCTV reported.This is not the first time Taiwan has encountered an accident involving Black Hawks. In February 2018, six people died in a crash and in March 2018, another Black Hawk had to land and run checks due to a system warning, mainland news website chinanews.com reported.Taiwan's military spent about 85 billion new Taiwan dollars ($2.83 billion) in 2008 to purchase the 60 Black Hawk helicopters from the US to replace its outdated UH-1H helicopters, a Taiwan's news website reported, noting the helicopters just became fully combat ready in October 2019.The cause of the Thursday accident has yet to be determined, Taiwan media said.Mainland military experts said Thursday that three factors could have resulted in a crash: bad weather, mechanical failure or pilot error.Taiwan's meteorological authority said the weather was fine in the region, according to Taiwan media reports.Mainland air defense expert Fu Qianshao told the Global Times on Thursday that the helicopter crashed in a mountainous area, a more demanding terrain for flying an aircraft.The weather should be checked before the flight, and the helicopter should reroute in the first place if it was dangerous, according to Fu.In terms of the possibility of mechanical failure, Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times that the Black Hawk itself is supposed to be a reliable helicopter used by many militaries in the world and is very adaptive and can operate on challenging terrains including plateaus, seas and deserts, making it highly rated by its users.There have been multiple malfunction reports from Taiwan since the Taiwan military began to use it, and small problems have kept occurring, Song said, noting that this showed Taiwan's military was having trouble with the helicopter's technical maintenance.The Black Hawk deal between the island of Taiwan and the US was poor business for Taiwan because the US asked for a much higher-than-average price and the configuration of the helicopters may also not be the most capable version, Song said.Taiwan lacks experience calibrating and maintaining the Black Hawk, and US maintenance would cost even more money, Song said.Fu said that no matter how reliable the Black Hawk, if regular maintenance is not well conducted, it will malfunction.The pilot who conducted such an important mission was supposed to be experienced and skilled, Fu said, noting that he should be able to deal with special conditions and prevent accidents.Any of these three possibilities could indicate serious problems in the Taiwan military's capability, experts said.Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the island as well as the Democratic Progressive Party candidate in the upcoming 2020 election, would stop the election campaign for three days, according to the statement released by Tsai's election office.Han Kuo-yu, the candidate of the KMT, also announced a stop for two days, Han's election office said in a statement.In the history of Taiwan election s, strange incidents always take place when the election day nears, and politicians will use them to manipulate public opinions and attack their rivals, and in some cases, these incidents will deeply impact the election situation and the result, said Li Xiaobing, an expert on Taiwan from Nankai University in Tianjin.For instance there was a shooting incident in 2004 which greatly helped then DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian to defeat his KMT rivals, Li noted.This is a chance for the DPP candidate Tsai to use her power and public resources to show society that she cares about the military, Li said.""In fact, the military in the island has already been isolated by the politicians, and their interests are seriously impacted,"" Li said. ""But now Tsai could use this incident as an opportunity to please the military and their families.""Chinese mainland analysts noted the incident was too close to the election day and so investigation of the case and other topics related to the case - such as arms sales between the island and the US - could be used by the politicians to affect the election result.

"Victim calls self-proclaimed spy Wang Liqiang a born liar, regrets not exposing himnPhoto: Wang Liqiang and screenshot from the court video Wang Liqiang, the self-proclaimed Chinese spy who defected to Australia, seems to have become an abandoned card after being used by Western media, yet some politicians on the island of Taiwan have ignored the facts and are mixing up black and white and using him as an anti-mainland chip.Sources close to Wang told the Global Times that he cheated his former boss surnamed Lu out of more than 2 million yuan ($285,885) in 2016. As Wang had written a ""letter of request for understanding"" and ""guarantee letter"" and promised to return the money, Lu did not report the fraud case to police.Lu told the Global Times in an exclusive interview in Shanghai that ""Wang Liqiang is a complete and born fraudster. I regret not sending him to the public security bureau.""Lu got to know Wang at a dinner in East China's Fujian Province in early 2016 after being introduced by one of Lu's friends. The friend said that Wang had just graduated from Anhui University of Finance and Economics (Wang actually studied at the university without obtaining a degree) and hoped to find a job in Shanghai. Lu happened to have businesses in Shanghai and agreed to recruit Wang as a favor to his friend.After the Spring Festival of 2016, Wang began working in Lu's company in Shanghai, which was when the deception began.According to the ""guarantee letter"", ""letter of request for understanding"" and other documents Lu showed to the Global Times, all of which were signed by Wang himself and carried his fingerprints, the fraudster had swindled Lu out of more than 2 million yuan using various excuses, including a low-cost property purchase and high return investments.Documents reveal that Wang cheated Lu out of more than 1 million yuan within a few months since April 2016, persuading him to invest in art works that he claimed would yield high returns.Wang had showed Lu two fake official files from the committee of Anhui University of Finance and Economics, which alleged that Wang was one of members in charge of the national arts fund work team at the university involving hundreds of million dollars.Wang claimed he needed deposits to unfreeze the large sum of frozen national arts funds and managed to swindle Lu out of 400,000 yuan in that case, Lu said, showing fabricated red-headed No. 32 and No. 33 university documents.When reached by the Global Times, Anhui University of Finance and Economics stated that the university's original No. 32 and No.33 documents in 2016 were related to the Party building work leadership team and the management of the university's official vehicles respectively. The documents Wang used to swindle Lu were completely fabricated.In the documents kept by Lu, Wang confessed that he used some of the swindled money to pay his own and his family members' debts, and the rest to pay for his luxurious lifestyle, such as spending more than 50,000 yuan on a Cartier watch.It was only after several months that Lu discovered there was something wrong with Wang and his money.""He used the new money I gave him as the investment return from a previous project. And I also noticed a strange phenomenon. Wang had to return to his hometown in Fujian Province every month, saying that he needed to take care of his father,"" Lu recalled.""Later, I learned that Wang was sentenced to jail for a year and three months in his hometown court, with a reprieve of a year and a half. I guess he had to be back home to report to local officials on his whereabouts. His employment in Shanghai may not have been approved by local authorities, so he had to go back home from time to time.""With the help of his lawyer, Lu discovered and exposed Wang's tricks and demanded that Wang shoulder all financial liability. Wang's father also rushed to Shanghai to beg for Lu's forgiveness. Wang kneeled in front of him and begged for forgiveness, writing a ""guarantee letter"" and ""letter of request for understanding,"" promising to pay the funds back.""To give the then 23-year-old Wang Liqiang a chance, I decided not to report him to police, after some hesitation,"" Lu told the Global Times. ""But I now regret that decision.""""Lu is extremely close to me. He has always cared about me. Big or trivial, his care for me is incomparable. He takes care of my food, clothing, housing, and transportation. He intends to coach and cultivate me so that I have a chance to survive in Shanghai,"" Wang Liqiang wrote in the ""letter of request for understanding."" ""But I have repeatedly deceived Lu, and I don't think I am a human being.""""Since school, Wang Liqiang has deceived his friends, schoolmates and then me and now foreigners abroad. All this proves that Wang is a 100 percent natural fraudster,"" Lu concluded. "	12/29/19	0	0	-0.1588	-1
"US is using ‘cry thief’ trick in Taiwan electionnPhoto: VCG With two weeks to go until the 2020 Taiwan regional leadership election in January, the Tsai Ing-wen authorities have been continuously accusing the Chinese mainland of trying to meddle with the election. US 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was signed by US President Donald Trump on December 20, even requests the director of National Intelligence to deliver a report on whether there are any ""influence operations conducted by China to interfere in or undermine such election"" within ""45 days after the date of the election.""However, it must be pointed out that it is not Beijing, but Washington, that has been constantly interfering in the regional leadership election of Taiwan.The Chinese mainland's domestically made aircraft carrier Shandong, which was newly commissioned into the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy, sailed through the Taiwan Straits on Thursday. It is a routine exercise and the PLA thus did not announce the operation. Yet Tsai's authorities have wantonly hyped up the move, in an attempt to escalate tensions across the Straits, which is allegedly believed to benefit the pro-independence camp's campaign. US Department of State, at this point, is adding fuel to the fire by asking the Chinese mainland to ""abstain from coercion"" toward Taiwan. This is Washington's latest move to root for Tsai's campaign.The so-called attempt to prevent the Chinese mainland from interfering in Taiwan election itself is a dirty calculative campaign plan, in which the US and the Taiwan island have been echoing each other. It is a known fact that the Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan are at a stalemate politically and militarily. If the mainland interferes in Taiwan's election, the results will only run contrary to the mainland's desire. This is broadly acknowledged by scholars across the Straits.Yet the US strategy toward China has been further clarified since November 2018, with Taiwan, used by the US as leverage to suppress and contain the Chinese mainland, being given an unprecedented spotlight.Over the past year, US legislative activities and statements on supporting Tsai's authorities have been rampant. The passing of the Taiwan Travel Act, Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (Taipei) Act and the NDAA have all sent one signal - the island of Taiwan can rest assured when confronting the Chinese mainland, the US will firmly support Taiwan authorities, which is taking a hard-line approach toward the Chinese mainland, and the US will only welcome the Taiwan authorities when they are sticking to the hard-line path.After the chaos in Hong Kong, which was triggered by an extradition amendment bill, the US has spared no efforts in supporting the city's radical protesters, thus echoing Tsai's move to take the advantage of Hong Kong affairs and shape the Taiwan public opinion for the upcoming election.Washington is eagerly hoping Tsai could win the election. This has been an open secret for long. The US, as an external force with crucial influence on Taiwan election, has not at all maintained neutrality as it has been claiming.The cross-Straits relationship has been improving since the 1980s, yet it is now in danger of returning to fierce confrontation.To a large extent, the US is the manipulator of the change. However, even if the US can manipulate Taiwan, it can hardly manipulate the entire situation across the Taiwan Straits. "	12/27/19	0	0	0.9625	1
"Shandong sails through Taiwan StraitsnAircraft carrier Shandong berths at a naval port in Sanya. Photo:China Military China's second aircraft carrier sails through the Taiwan Straits into the South China Sea. Photo: screenshot from the Weibo account of the PLA Navy Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said on Thursday at a routine press conference that ""everything is well"" in terms of the Shandong's condition after its commissioning. The Shandong will continue to run tests and conduct training by teaming up with other vessels, and will form a systematic combat capability through training, Wu said. Military observers expect the Shandong will soon form initial combat capability. Any minor adjustments before that should be considered normal and will contribute to the warship's combat readiness, they say. Frequent passages The Shandong sailed the Taiwan Straits twice in more than a month, and such passages will become more frequent or even routine, experts predicted. The location of the Sanya naval base means not only this time, but every time the Shandong wants to go north, it will likely pass the Taiwan Straits, Xu said, noting the carrier would eventually sail into the West Pacific from the eastern side of the Taiwan island. Li too believed the Shandong could conduct training by sailing through the first island chain. ""Even if it is not this time, it is only a matter of time before the Shandong cruises into the Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean and waters farther away,"" Li said.

China's second aircraft carrier Shandong reportedly sailed through the Taiwan Straits on Thursday in its apparent first-ever mission after joining the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy last week.The voyage is possibly a part of a routine exercise or normal relocation, and the Sanya-based warship will come and go in the region often as such transits will likely become routine, Chinese mainland experts said.Accompanied by escort vessels, the domestically developed aircraft carrier sailed through the Straits from south to north on Thursday afternoon, a Taipei-based news website reported on Thursday, citing the defense authority for the island of Taiwan.The Shandong was commissioned into the PLA Navy on December 17 with a grand ceremony held at a naval base in Sanya, South China's Hainan Province, making Thursday's visit to the Taiwan Straits its apparent first mission with the PLA Navy.This is the second time the warship has passed through the Straits. On November 17, the carrier sailed through from north to south, with the start point Dalian Shipyard in Northeast China's Liaoning Province, where it was built, and its destination the naval base in Sanya.Xu Guangyu, a senior adviser to the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told the Global Times on Thursday that the carrier's voyage was likely an exercise now as the navy has its hands on it, making it a ""normal maritime activity"" for the warship.Based in Sanya, the Shandong needs to sail through the Taiwan Straits ""from a geographical point of view"" if it wants to go to places like China's other aircraft carrier base in Qingdao, East China's Shandong Province, or its birthplace, the Dalian Shipyard, Xu said.Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, told the Global Times on Thursday that the destination of this trip was more likely to be the Dalian Shipyard.A spokesperson of the PLA Navy said when the carrier sailed through the Taiwan Straits for the first time in November that voyage was cross-regional testing and training, which means the entire voyage from Dalian to Sanya was part of a sea trial, Li said.That trial involved for long distances, deep waters, high temperatures, humidity and salinity, making it the most complicated sea trial the Shandong ever faced, he noted.The Shandong also used new weapons and technical equipment that may have needed calibrations and adjustments after the trial, Li said.Li said that if this was the case, it by no means indicated the Shandong had technical issues.""It's like a new car that just traveled long distance and the driver wants to take it back for maintenance,"" he said.

"DPP’s Hong Kong card will fail despite Taiwan and HK separatists’ collusionnPhoto taken on June 20, 2019 shows the night view of Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan. (Xinhua/Zhu Xiang) Since the now-withdrawn ordinance amendments concerning fugitives' transfers sparked unrest in Hong Kong in June, Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has repeated its support for the ""anti-extradition bill movement."" In an attempt to win the 2020 Taiwan regional elections, Tsai Ing-wen has exploited the movement to whip up sentiment against the Chinese mainland to improve her chance of winning. However, with the movement turning into violence and turmoil, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government has ratcheted up efforts to restore order. It is reported that so far over 200 protesters have fled Hong Kong for Taiwan to avoid possible punishments. Tsai is in a dilemma on dealing with these protesters illegally entering Taiwan. Since winning the election in 2016, the DPP has been refusing to recognize the 1992 Consensus and seeking an incremental process toward ""Taiwan secession,"" leading to strained cross-Straits relations. Violent protesters and rioters in Hong Kong have regarded Taiwan as the shelter and the DPP as an ally to confront the Chinese mainland. As protests in Hong Kong turned more violent, the rioters appealed to the DPP to enact a refugee bill as soon as possible, so that the island can offer shelter to those law-breakers in Hong Kong. Some rioters even advised Taiwan regional authorities to amend the so-called Laws and Regulations Regarding Hong Kong & Macao Affairs, enacted by Taiwan's ""mainland affairs council,"" and hope Taiwan can issue clearer and more powerful protection mechanism and rescue measures. Those rioters who have illegally entered Taiwan require Taiwan regional authorities to provide substantial assistance, for example not classifying them as illegal immigrants and supplying necessary shelter. Before the rioters fled to Taiwan, the island was concerned about the unrest in Hong Kong. Generally, the society in Taiwan has been disapproving of the violence by protesters. Moves such as disrupting public transportation, setting public property on fire, vandalizing shops and attacking ordinary people have violated the rule of law. In recent years, although Taiwan society has seen fierce discords between pro-reunification and pro-secession camps as well as escalating economic and social contradictions, people who are dissatisfied with the status quo tend to express their appeals peacefully. Many Taiwan residents are worried that once granting unconditional protection to rioters from Hong Kong, Taiwan would become their sanctuary. It may encourage the rioters to behave unscrupulously and crank up violent activities in Hong Kong, eventually leading to a large number of rioters flowing into the island. This would affect security in Taiwan. Some in Taiwan are also concerned that Hong Kong secession forces may join hands with Taiwan secessionists and their supporters, leading to worsening cross-Straits relations. Therefore, the public in Taiwan doesn't support enacting a refugee bill. Since the outbreak of Hong Kong unrest, Tsai authorities have been using the turmoil to provoke local people against the mainland, so as to gain votes for the 2020 election. However, although the DPP has the majority in the ""Legislative Yuan"" of Taiwan and can push the enactment of refugee legislation, Tsai ruled it out and said existing legislation is sufficient. Taiwan authority's moves and rhetoric on Hong Kong unrest are out of the attempt to maintain the DPP's electoral support. For winning reelection in 2020 amid her political performance, Tsai has to play ""sovereignty"" and ""security"" cards in the campaign. The support from Tsai and the DPP for Hong Kong violence has created an illusion among the protesters that ""Taiwan secessionists"" would unconditionally bolster ""Hong Kong secession."" Hence, they urged the island to enact the refugee act, but the results backfired. It is predictable that Hong Kong secessionist groups won't give up wooing ""Taiwan secession"" forces, which would vice versa continue taking advantage of the former.

"China voices strong dissatisfaction with US defense act negative clauses regarding China: spokespersonnChinese and US national flags. Photo:Xinhua China on Monday expressed strong dissatisfaction with the United States over the negative contents distorting and smearing China's military development and on issues relating to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang as well as prohibited purchase of Chinese products, in the US 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, said a Foreign Ministry spokesperson.Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang told a news briefing that China has lodged solemn representations with the United States over this.China urges the United States to discard its Cold War mentality and ideological bias, treat China's development and China-US relations with an objective and rational manner, and not to implement the negative clauses against China to avoid damages to bilateral ties and cooperation in important areas, Geng said.The Act also authorized the establishment of the United States Space Force. Geng said the US has been pushing its space dominance strategy, going further down the path of weaponization of outer space and risking turning it into a new theater of warfare.Such moves seriously violate the international consensus on the peaceful use of outer space, undermine the global strategic balance and stability, and pose a direct threat to peace and security of outer space.""China is deeply concerned about and firmly opposed to this,"" Geng said.He said the security of outer space that the United States has claimed to be pursuing is merely security for itself. However, the fundamental purpose of the international community is to safeguard the common security of all humankind in outer space.The United States has been obstinate in its pursuit of weaponization of outer space but repeatedly make an issue of China and Russia, Geng said. ""This is the guilty party shifting the blame on the innocent and seeking excuses to free itself.""China has always advocated the peaceful use of outer space and opposed the weaponizing of and waging an arms race in outer space. Under the current situation, there is greater necessity and urgency to initiate negotiation of a legally-binding instrument on outer space arms control, according to the spokesperson.""We hope the international community, especially relevant major countries, will take a prudent and responsible attitude to safeguard the lasting peace and tranquility in outer space and make sure it will not turn into a new battlefield,"" Geng said.

(Xinhua/Zhu Xiang) China on Saturday voiced strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to negative clauses on Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang in the US 2020 National Defense Authorization Act.You Wenze, spokesperson of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress, said the clauses are unfounded and biased, and have blatantly interfered in China's domestic affairs.The Taiwan-related content of the act has seriously violated the one-China principle and the three joint communiques between China and the United States, and seriously damaged China-U.S. relations as well as peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, he said. Aerial view taken on June 19, 2016 shows the scenery in Hong Kong, south China. (Xinhua/Lui Siu Wai) Taiwan issue is China's domestic affair that allows no interference, the spokesperson added.On Hong Kong affairs, the spokesperson stressed that a series of violent crimes in Hong Kong have sabotaged public security and orders, seriously challenged rule of law and the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle.The spokesperson said extreme violent criminal acts cannot be excuses for any aspirations, and the U.S. attempt to interfere in other countries' domestic affairs using the so-call ""democracy"" and ""human rights"" will be in vain.

"Experts have heated discussion over reunification with TaiwannPhoto taken on July 21, 2019 from Xiangshan Mountain shows the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan. (Photo: Xinhua) Focusing on whether 2020 is a crucial year for the reunification of the Chinese mainland and Taiwan and if this will be realized via a peaceful process or armed conflict, many experts across the board from both the mainland and Taiwan had an ardent and erudite discussion, during the annual Global Times forum on Saturday.Wang Hongguang, a retired lieutenant general of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), said at the forum the year 2020 will be a crucial juncture for the reunification of the Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan since pro-independence forces in Taiwan now have greater influence in the island. The damage will be irreparable if the reunification is delayed by five to 10 more years.No matter which party in Taiwan wins the election slated in 2020, they dare not declare the independence of Taiwan. While the incumbent Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen once said reunification is not the only choice for Taiwan, the reality is that reunification is the only remaining choice for Taiwan, said Luo Yuan, executive vice president and secretary-general of the China Strategic Culture Promotion Association and also a retired Major General. The critical question is if a peaceful approach to achieve the goal is the only choice, he noted.Chang Ya-chung, a professor from the National Taiwan University, believes the Chinese mainland should firstly discuss ways to end the confrontation of the two sides and promote the unification work, before tackling other issues.Chang said realizing reunification by armed forces might be a plausible option but he is also worried the US may sacrifice Taiwan and use it as a leverage to deal with China.The US may incite Taiwan to engage in armed conflicts with the Chinese mainland and end up turning Taiwan into another Afghanistan, Chang cautioned.""Sacrificing Taiwan may not be a big deal for the US, but China may fall into the US trap,"" said Chang.According to Chang, instead of talking about the expectations for the reunification, more work should be done before the reunification.Chang and Wang had a heated discussion on the suitable means to deal with the current cross-Straits relations. Wang insisted realizing reunification is of utmost urgency as he believes that many people in Taiwan are swaying away from the one-China principle and do not consider themselves as Chinese anymore. Chang noted it is more important to bridge the gap between people across the Straits and win the support of the Taiwan residents.The closing remarks of Wang Zaixi, former deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, was thoroughly applauded by the audience.He said winning the heart of the people in Taiwan is still an important work and if ""we have not done a good job, we should introspect.""Global Times "	12/21/19	0	0	0.963	1

"US defense bill interferes in Taiwan, slammed as thief crying ‘Stop thief!’nChinese demonstrators sing songs and chant slogans while waiting for the arrival of Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen in Los Angeles in August 2018. Photo: Wang Rujun The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) showcases blatant US interference in the upcoming election on the island of Taiwan, Chinese experts said on Wednesday, and warned the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that pulling closer to the US would backfire.The act that passed the US Senate on Tuesday stipulates that the US Director of National Intelligence should submit a report on the influence exerted by the Chinese mainland on elections in Taiwan no later than 45 days after the election date to congressional intelligence committees.The act also included sections about improving the predictability of arms sales to Taiwan, strengthening security support for the island, and the feasibility and plans for engaging with Taiwan in cybersecurity activities.Chinese analysts on Wednesday slammed the act, saying it showed the US stepping up interference in the election and was clear evidence of the US using the DPP as a chess piece to meddle in Taiwan affairs.The experts said that the new act by strengthening cybersecurity cooperation upgrades US interference in the island of Taiwan and so threatens Taiwan security.The US has been increasingly provocative about Taiwan with arms sales and domestic legislation to encourage and mobilize secessionist forces in the island, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University's Institute of International Relations in Beijing, told the Global Times on Wednesday.""Presuming mainland influence in elections to justify its own interference is an old US trick of the thief crying 'Stop thief!'"" said Li.Analysts said the mainland's policies toward the island of Taiwan are clear and consistent and Beijing did not interfere in the region's election as the Chinese government has its own pace of reunification.A military expert who required anonymity said that Beijing was always prepared for the worst.""If the US and Taiwan secessionist forces make any unwise decision to cross the red line, we are capable of dealing with the situation,"" he said.Some internet users on the island of Taiwan condemned the DPP for acting as a US pawn for containment of the Chinese mainland.The act is expected to be signed by US President Donald Trump before becoming a law.In October, the US passed the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act in the wake of an international trend of severing ""diplomatic ties"" with the island.Ma Xiaoguang, an official with the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council in Beijing, warned then that the DPP administration was playing along with the US ""Taiwan card,"" which would only undermine the interests of compatriots on both sides, ""especially those from Taiwan.""The mainland has its own strategy of increasing economic and overall strength to attract Taiwan compatriots, Li said, and any interference by secessionist or foreign forces will only backfire on them.

"Senior official expounds on peaceful reunificationnTourists visit Juancun village in Penghu, southeast China's Taiwan, Aug. 27, 2019. (Photo: Xinhua) A senior Chinese mainland official responsible for Taiwan affairs published an article in the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Thursday to expound on plans to realize reunification, the same day the US House of Representatives passed the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act which includes parts related to the Taiwan question.Chinese experts noted that publishing such an article at this time, a month ahead of Taiwan's regional ""election,"" showed that no matter which political party, pro-status quo or pro-secessionist, wins the election next year, the principle and grand strategy that the mainland holds won't change, and the mainland has enough confidence and strength to dominate and actively shape the process of reunification regardless of what happens inside the island and what the US does to interfere.The People's Daily on Thursday published an article by Liu Jieyi, head of the Taiwan Work Office of the CPC Central Committee and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, titled ""Firmly advance the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland.""The article reflected the thorough study and implementation of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee on the Taiwan question.Liu said in the article, ""peaceful reunification, the 'one country, two systems' principle is the basic policy for solving the Taiwan question and the best way to achieve national reunification.""""The development of the mainland is fundamentally determining the direction of the cross-Straits relationship…On the strength comparison between the two sides of the Straits, the mainland has realized comprehensive and overwhelming advantage toward Taiwan,"" he said.Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan at Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times on Thursday that ""this shows the mainland and the CPC's confidence and judgment on the Taiwan question has not been affected by the current situation.""In 2019, Li said, Taiwan secessionist forces used the Hong Kong turmoil to demonize the ""one country, two systems"" principle.The US has been stepping up efforts to support Taiwan secessionists with arms sales and domestic legislation, and piling diplomatic pressures on the countries who cut off ""diplomatic"" ties with the island, he said.""But this hasn't changed the fact that the mainland is getting more and more initiatives in the process of solving the Taiwan question,"" Li said. Liu Jieyi, head of the Taiwan Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, addresses the opening ceremony of the eighth Cross-Strait Legal Forum for Peaceful Development in north China's Tianjin, Aug. 22, 2019. Photo: Xinhua The key source of this confidence is the development of the mainland, said Song Luzheng, a research fellow and an expert on Taiwan studies at the China Institute of Fudan University in Shanghai.Regardless of who is governing Taiwan, the mainland will have many measures and tools to integrate individuals and specific groups of the Taiwan island into the national development plan and public opinion in Taiwan will gradually change, Song believed.Liu said in the People's Daily article that the mainland will continuously strengthen its influence and attraction to Taiwan society, and strengthen its traction and domination of the development of the cross-Straits relationship.The two sides of the Straits have become an unbreakable community with a shared future, Liu said, and the mainland has become Taiwan's biggest export market, import source, trade surplus source and investment destination outside the island.Li of Nankai University said perhaps the current conditions for reunification are not very ideal, ""but based on these facts, the mainland still has a lot of approaches and measures that can be used to include Taiwan into its development and has patience to actively shape conditions step by step.""In the past, he said, ""We were nervous when the island held elections and worried about the victory of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), but now, we found that the process of reunification can still be pushed forward even if the DPP is governing the island and maybe the process has even moved faster than the era of the Kuomintang in many fields.""Li noted declining international recognition for Taiwan while the mainland directly attracts Taiwan people, especially youth, to study, work and start up businesses.""In the future, with no doubt, the number of the countries having diplomatic ties with Taiwan will be further reduced, even to zero. More policies that encourage the people-to-people integration across the Straits will also be issued.""Earlier on Thursday, the US House of Representatives passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, and Chinese experts agreed that the US will likely keep or even step up its interference over the Taiwan question in the future.Session 1257 of the act said that ""the Secretary of Defense should continue regular transits of United States Navy vessels through the Taiwan Strait…and encourage allies and partners to follow suit in conducting such transits.""Li said the US is realizing that the mainland is getting more dominance in the reunification process and the US has to adjust its strategy to ensure it can still use the Taiwan question to make trouble for China and gain benefits.A military expert at a Beijing-based military academy who asked for anonymity said, ""These changes are meaningless. It's clear that Washington wants to maintain a presence in the region but carefully avoids further provocation. Because the US can't afford a military conflict with China so it is very unlikely to cross the red line on the Taiwan question. China's military strength is enough to reunify Taiwan and its advantage will be more and more overwhelming in the future. This is the condition for the mainland to push forward peaceful reunification.""The People's Liberation Army (PLA) is always prepared for the worst, he said. ""If US and Taiwan secessionist forces make any unwise decision to cross the red line, the PLA is capable of dealing with the situation and even realizing reunification, although we know this is not the best way.""

"Ex-drug user actor from Taiwan faces netizen boycottnPhoto: web Mainland netizens called for a boycott of the possible comeback of an ex-drug user actor from Taiwan island after he announced his new role at a press conference of a TV drama.The hashtag ""Ko Chen-tung comes back"" on Sina Weibo received 610 million views and 128,000 comments as of press time.Netizens slammed the comeback of Kai Ko, who has been out of public sight for over five years since his reported drug use in 2014 August. Hong Kong entertainer Jaycee Fong Jo Ming was also involved in the case.""Celebrities who took drugs should be permanently banned from public sight,"" said one netizen, noting that drug enforcers risk their lives to protect people from drugs.But some netizens insist Ko deserves a second chance to show the public he has changed.Zhu Wei, a professor at the China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing, said that the ban on the comeback of celebrities who took drugs should be permanent.""Influential public figures like Ko have an effect on the youth, who are very likely to follow their behavior, even the wrong ones,"" Zhu said.Zhu stressed the severity of celebrities' drug abuse, and the public should have zero tolerance for the behavior.Some netizens also expressed concerns that Ko's planned comeback might lead other ex-drug user celebrities to return.""A permanent ban on Ko's comeback will send a message that a one-time pleasure will cause life-long unemployment in the entertainment industry,"" Zhu said.Regulations on celebrities' misconduct have been strengthened in recent years.In September 2014, about one month after the Ko's case, the National Radio and Television Administration issued a notice banning artists who abused drugs and engaged in criminal acts. The ban states that public figures' bad behavior will damage the image of the industry and have a negative social impact, especially detrimental to the healthy growth of young people.

"Mainland to facilitate Taiwan firms’ progressnA man rides a bike past the National Development and Reform Commission in Beijing. Photo: VCG Companies from the island of Taiwan are being encouraged to participate in projects involving major technological equipment, industrial innovation centers and other activities under equal treatment in the Chinese mainland, which could facilitate their technological innovation and quality development, an official said. This process has important meaning for Taiwan's economic growth, which has been slowing for years, and the development of its technology sector, Dai Shugeng, director of the International Finance Research Office at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. In terms of industry development, the mainland has surpassed Taiwan in many technological fields, Dai said, and the measures could offer great opportunities and cooperation for Taiwan companies under the condition of equal treatment. ""The Chinese mainland welcomes Taiwan-funded companies to make full use of the vast market and development opportunities in the mainland to enhance technological innovation capabilities and market competitiveness,"" Zheng Chiping, deputy director of the Department of Foreign Capital and Overseas Investment of China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said at a press conference on Wednesday. The mainland has a full range of industries, ranking first in manufacturing scale in the world, and it has rapidly improved its industrial technology, Zheng told the media. Among the ""26 measures"" rolled out by the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office and the NDRC in November, the first measure noted that Taiwan-funded companies could equally take part in projects involving major technological equipment, construction of industrial innovation centers, engineering research centers and other activities. Taiwan companies could enjoy equal treatment with companies from the mainland, Zhang said, adding that some Taiwan-based companies are actively participating in these projects and enjoying preferential policies such as full refunds of value-added tax.

"Chinese customs returns containers carrying transgenic corn seeds from the USnStaff of Shantou customs in South China's Guangdong Province quarantine corn seeds in containers. (Photo: Shantou Customs) Chinese customs on Saturday returned 46 inbound containers carrying transgenic corn seeds, originally from the US, media reported.Customs officials in Shantou, South China's Guangdong Province, found grass, live insects and 50 kilograms of corn seeds during an inspection of the mostly empty containers on November 27, which were transferred to Shantou after unloading US corn in the island of Taiwan, the Guangzhou Daily reported on Monday.It was confirmed after testing that the corn seeds were genetically modified.In order to prevent genetically modified seeds from entering China without approval - which could endanger China's agriculture, animal husbandry and grain production - customs officials in Shantou have ordered relevant enterprises to return the containers in accordance with the customs regulation on the inspection and quarantine.The individual in charge of Shantou's customs said the containers, as important means of cargo transportation, could easily deposit a variety of plant seeds, pests and soils during the process of cross-border transportation, and that they could lead to the cross-border spread of epidemic diseases.

"Fleeing HK rioters backfire on TaiwannHong Kong rioters set fires in the street on September 7. Photo: GT The move by some Hong Kong protesters who reportedly fled to Taiwan seeking ""citizenship,"" jobs and residency in the island represented a laughable backfire on the Taiwan authority for its interference in Hong Kong, Chinese analysts said Monday.The comments came after media reported that more than 200 protesters involved in illegal activities during the six months' turmoil in Hong Kong have fled to Taiwan with some requesting alleged ""citizenship,"" jobs and residency.Analysts said separatists from Hong Kong and Taiwan could work together to create trouble for the mainland, but when they need cover or assistance from each other, they will find each other very insincere and unreliable.Those Hong Kong protesters are trouble, not only for Taiwan but anywhere they go, analysts warned.A poster allegedly by Hong Kong protesters circulated on social media last week, showing protesters were planning to organize a protest on Monday noon at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in Hong Kong at Lippo Centre.The protesters planned to voice ""three demands,"" asking Taiwan to provide ""citizenship,"" job opportunities and temporary residency for fleeing protesters.Some radical protesters on social media also threatened that if Taiwan didn't respond to these demands, they would smash and storm the office.The Global Times reporter called TECO for inquiry and a female employee who declined to give her name said the office would make ""no comment"" on the matter.No information was available as of press time on whether the office has been attacked or any protest took place on Monday at the TECO.On the TECO website in Hong Kong, a notice posted Friday reads ""Protests and gatherings may occur at Lippo Centre on Monday. We suggest people do not come to the office unless necessary…""The New York Times Sunday reported that due to the fear of imprisonment and other punishments, more than 200 protesters from the city fled to Taiwan, which supports their illegal acts in the name of ""democracy and freedom.""""A few nights before, they were hurling Molotov cocktails on the front lines of the anti-government protests that have roiled Hong Kong for months,"" the US newspaper reported.""But after the police arrested two of their friends, they feared they would be next.""Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said it supported Hong Kong people's ""fight for freedom,"" but Taiwan was a ""society with rule of law,"" and so Taiwan authorities would not encourage anyone to come to the island through illegal ways.The council urged Hong Kong protesters ""not to violate the law.""During the turmoil, Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is governing the island, used two approaches to interfere in Hong Kong affairs, Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan study at Nankai University, told the Global Times on Monday.""Openly, they use the turmoil as a cover to demonize the 'one country, two systems' principle to serve their local election need and rationalize their separatist stance,"" Li said.""On the other hand, they secretly provide supports including materials and training to the protesters and rioters so that they can keep the fire burning in Hong Kong. But this doesn't mean the DPP likes these protesters, not mention to offering 'citizenship' to them,"" Li said.When protesters flee to Taiwan to seek protection, they will become trouble for Taiwan, said a Taiwan-based observer on politics who asked for anonymity.If Hong Kong rioters need help to stir trouble in Hong Kong, they can easily find support, because they are destroying their own home and this is why they are useful and worth the support of some overseas forces, he noted.""But when they flee anywhere, they are a trouble and burden to that place, so they are not welcome,"" the observer told the Global Times on Monday.Taiwan web users commented on Facebook about this issue.""Why they are coming? Teaching us to make Molotov cocktails?"" posted one user.""Our authorities noticed this only after reading the New York Times report. Go investigate and kick them out!"" another replied.

More than 1.4 billion Chinese welcome you to the mainland for a concert,"" a comment said on Sina Weibo.Neitizens also called for serious punishment on rioters.The local Public Security Bureau had vowed to check surveillance footage to track down suspects who damaged the venue's walls. The bureau had upgraded security to the highest level, chinatimes.com reported.All visitors went through a pat down and thorough inspection of their bags before entering the venue, while staff checked the washroom for suspicious individuals, it said.Rumors online suggested that Chan would wear a bulletproof vest, but concert organizers denied the report on Saturday, Hong Kong-based Wen Wei Po reported.Chan is not the only one to suffer abuse and physical threats due to remarks in support of Hong Kong Police.Several Hong Kong celebrities, including Jackie Chan, pop singer Jackson Wang Ka-yee and actor William Chan have also been targets of abuse after they promised on Sina Weibo to protect the Chinese national flag after several masked rioters disgraced the flag by throwing it into the sea on August 4.Mainland pop star Zhang Yixing has also been repeatedly abused online for supporting Hong Kong police on both domestic and international social media platforms including Sina Weibo and Twitter. His family's private information was disclosed on social media and Zhang's personal information was even used by some haters to sign up for organ donation.Zhang cancelled his Hong Kong concert for security reasons on August 12.Some radical netizens who support illegal protests in Hong Kong called for a boycott of Disney's film Mulan in August because the film's leading actor Liu Yifei expressed her support for Hong Kong police on her Weibo account.

"Prague's sister-city ties with Taipei escalates feud between Czech capital and ChinanThe Voltava River runs through the city of Prague, capital of Czech Republic, November 21, 2018. Photo: Xinhua Prague mayor Zdenek Hrib announced on Monday that the city will sign a sister-city agreement with Taipei in January 2020 and the decision has already been approved by the Prague city council.Beijing terminated the Prague-Beijing sister-city agreement and suspended all official contact with Prague on October 9, after the Prague mayor publicly challenged the one-China principle.Prague's further move of signing the agreement with Taipei after cutting ties with Beijing is highly politicized, an expert on European issues told The Global Times on condition of anonymity.This is an edge ball played by the Prague city council, he noted. The agreement seems legitimate in a way that it promotes the exchange at a regional level, but the underlying political purpose is rather notable considering the escalating feud between the Czech capital and China.Beijing's action of canceling the twin city agreement sounded a warning to Prague, but apparently the city council has ignored it and gone further, he added.Prague mayor Hrib has clashed with China over Taiwan and Tibet since taking office. He previously pushed to remove the clause stating Prague's support for the one-China policy in the twin city agreement. In March, his municipal administration flew the flag used by the 14th Dalai Lama's ""government-in-exile"" from Prague's town hall.The Chinese FM responded to Prague's and the mayor's poor decisions on issues concerning China's core interests and sovereignty at a routine press briefing in July, urging Prague city council and certain politicians to change course and stop undermining China-Czech relations to avoid hurting their own interests.""The Czech government should impose pressure on its capital city council to make its national stand clear at this point,"" the expert noted.The Czech government has consistently upheld the one-China principle, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy to the Czech Republic noted on the embassy's website in October.

"NGOs get financial support from US govt, smear ChinanThe United States Capitol Photo: VCG ○ Some NGOs in the US are actually backed by the US government and intelligence agencies that provoke subversive activities○ These NGOs fabricate stories on Xinjiang , Tibet, Taiwan and Hong Kong under the guise of protecting ""human rights""○ Ignoring China's accomplishments in human rights, these NGOs release reports smearing ChinaSome US-based nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have played a disgraceful role in pushing for regime change, bringing global turmoil and cooperating with the US government and other anti-China forces to contain China, Chinese experts said.China announced sanctions on a batch of US NGOs on Monday in response to the ""Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.""Some observers said more sanctions may be introduced after the passage of the ""Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act"" on Tuesday.Under the guise of protecting ""human rights"" and ""democracy,"" some US NGOs supported by US politicians and US intelligence agencies ignore China's development and fabricate stories about China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Tibet Autonomous Region and Taiwan, according to experts. They noted that NGOs often release reports smearing China.The US-based NGOs on China's sanction list announced on Monday include National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), Freedom House, National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI) and Human Rights Watch. Hong Kong rioters set fires in the street on September 7. Photo: GT These NGOs flaunt neutrality despite always having been manipulated by the US government to promote US hegemony, experts said.The Global Times found that these NGOs are explicitly supported by the US government and work to safeguard the interests of the US elite.For example, the NED was founded in 1983 and claimed to be a private nonprofit fund dedicated to the growth and strengthening of democratic institutions around the world. It offers more than 1,600 grants each year to support the projects of nongovernmental groups abroad that are working for so-called democratic goals in more than 90 countries and regions. The money largely comes from the US Congress.Allen Weinstein, a co-founder of the NED, told The Washington Post in 1991 that ""a lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA.""IRI claims to be a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization but it accepts money from the US State Department and US Agency for International Development (USAID). USAID is a federal government organ that has advanced US foreign policies such as promoting free markets since the 1980s. It claims a record of ""helping"" countries establish democracies since the 1990s.Freedom House also calls itself an independent organization dedicated to the expansion of ""freedom"" and ""democracy"" around the world.However, 80 percent of its funds are from the US government and it works for US authorities, according to an article published in 2005 on a journal affiliated to China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations.Founded in 1941 to oppose communism in Europe, the Washington-based organization works as a think tank for the US Department of Defense and is closely linked to the Busch family.""These NGOs would not bite the hands that feed them, which means they are working on imposing US rules and ideology on other countries and regions. They want to mold others to fit the needs of the US and to serve US interests,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University's Institute of International Relations, told the Global Times.""With prejudice and superiority, these NGOs usually take the moral high ground and interfere in other countries' affairs. Many of their reports, especially those on human rights, are biased and not objective. They also impose US-style democracy globally without considering local conditions, which usually brings destruction in many parts of the world,"" Li said.In a 2018 article, US journalist Max Brumenthal called NED a US-funded ""meddling machine"" that interferes in elections around the globe.The NED has also backed coups against independent governments.The NED, IRI and NDI claim to directly support groups working for human rights, independent media, the rule of law, and a wide range of civil society initiatives.NED also claims to cultivate partner organizations in other countries and regions, citing their work with Polish NGOs to advance democratic civic education throughout Central Europe and in parts of the former Soviet Union.According to its website, NED was behind the transformation of East Europe in the 1980s and 1990s.It was also involved in the ""color revolutions"" and long-term unrest in Ukraine and Georgia.In recent years, Freedom House's main activities have been in countries destabilized by Western intervention including Serbia, Ukraine and others in the Middle East.It backs internal regime change by instigating young intellectuals, according to a report by German news magazine Der Spiegel in June 2008.Every year since 1972, Freedom House has released a report assessing political rights and civil liberties around the world. Their biased assessment ranks countries as ""Free,"" ""Partly Free"" and ""Not Free.""Human Rights Watch was originally called Helsinki Watch. It was created in 1978 during the Cold War to scrutinize and criticize ""the crimes"" that were being committed by the former Soviet Union and its allies. That Cold War ideology has long played a role in the kinds of priorities and advocacy that the institute engages in.A report by a Switzerland-based website us-politik.ch points out that most of NGOs in the US are actually ""GoNGOs,"" which means these NGOs are organized by the US government. Freedom House and NED are listed as ""GoNGOs.""""GoNGOs"" are funded by the US government, so they work at the will of the US and help publicly defend US intervention, according to the report. Global Times Since smearing China has become ""politically correct"" in the US, US NGOs now work with media, think tanks and US politicians to hype sensitive topics, especially those on China's Xinjiang, Tibet and Taiwan. They have tried hard to make trouble for China and to contain China, analysts said.Giving financial support to secessionist groups in Chinese territories is one way US NGOs meddle in China's affairs. NED granted $670,000 in 2018 for projects related to Xinjiang, a region it referred to as ""East Turkestan,"" a term used by secessionist forces. More than half of the money went to the World Uyghur Congress, an infamous separatist organization.In 2018, NED offered $4.75 million in support of so-called human rights activists in the Chinese mainland.NED has sponsored publications and radio broadcasts by secessionist Tibetans in exile, helping them to record so-called human rights violations and cultivate a new generation of secessionists. It gave about $630,000 to such programs in 2018 alone.According to Hong Kong news outlet wenweipo.com, NED increased its investment in Hong Kong after the ""Occupy Central Movement"" in 2014. It spent some $1.3 million to sponsor Hong Kong-based groups from 1990 to 2018. Between 2015 and 2018, an average of $450,000 was spent on the city to instigate sabotage.According to NED's own data, it spent more than $1.16 million to Hong Kong from 2016 to 2018. A majority of the sponsorship went to Solidarity Center (SC) and National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI), which NED referred to as core grantees.Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, with former opposition lawmaker Lee Cheuk-yan as secretary-general, admitted the organization received more than $70,000 each year from SC, wenweipo.com reported.Jimmy Lai Chee-ying has been sponsoring opposition organizations and lawmakers via his media group Next Digital Ltd, which is running a deficit. His company is another subsidiary of NED.Drawing dissidents over to their side, maintaining close relations with infamous separatists and separatist groups, and releasing so-called neutral reports to cooperate with media to smear China are methods adopted by these NGOs, experts said.In 2019, NED conferred its Democracy Award on three organizations including The World Uyghur Congress and Tibet Action Institute, an organization of secessionist Tibetans in exile. Since 1991, NED has given many awards to dissidents.An expert on human rights who asked for anonymity told the Global Times that Human Rights Watch often releases reports accusing China and other developing countries of human rights violations but seldom notes severe human rights situations in the US.""Their reports are never neutral and are always made for political reasons. Their Xinjiang reports, for example, are not fact-checked and accused China of oppressing 13 million Uyghurs in Xinjiang,"" said the expert, noting that Sophie Richardson, China director of Human Rights Watch, often re-tweeted fake news or rumors about Xinjiang on her Twitter account.Human Rights Watch has always been enthusiastic about criticizing other countries and regions and pays close attention to topics on juridical fairness, racial discrimination, extortion, and confession by torture.However, the organization ignores cases of police beating African-Americans to death in the US or the infamous abuse of detainees in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.Kenneth Roth is the executive director of Human Rights Watch and has been regarded as a hard-core member of the organization. In the end of 2009, 118 scholars publicly criticized Human Rights Watch's report and Roth's remarks on Venezuela for being full of hypocrisy and misinformation.A letter jointly released in May 2014 by more than 130 scholars calling on Human Rights Watch to close their revolving door to the US government noted that many members of the Human Rights Watch are former CIA agents and former US officials. The organization's standard on human rights is in accordance with the US diplomatic policies and interests, thus damaging its credibility and independence.The US and some Western countries have used human rights as a tool to implement their foreign policy and adopt double standards when accessing human rights situations, keeping ""neutral"" when a country closely follows the US and fiercely accusing a country when it goes against the US, said Qian Jinyu, executive dean of the Human Rights Institution of Northwest University of Political Science and Law in Shaanxi Province.US NGOs including the Human Rights Watch always deliberately ignore China's developments on human rights protection and hype some problems to cater to the stereotypes and prejudice of some people in the West, Qian told the Global Times.He noted that China's sanctions on these US NGOs may make them more transparent in dealing with China.But driven by political interests, some may interfere with China's affairs more frequently to earn more support.

"Death of TV show contestant triggers criticism of physically demanding programsnGodfrey Gao Photo: VCG The death of Taiwan island actor Godfrey Gao on Wednesday while filming a sports entertainment show in Ningbo, East China's Zhejiang Province, has attracted public attention to sudden cardiac death and caused a flood of criticism on social media against physically demanding competitions that can put performers in danger. Gao, 35, collapsed early Wednesday morning while shooting ""Chase Me,"" a program that requires contestants to run and undergo intense physical challenges produced by Zhejiang TV station (Zhejiang STV). Gao's family has flown to Zhejiang and will take Gao's body back to Taiwan on Thursday, media reported. The program's producer said on Sina Weibo they gave Gao emergency medical attention before sending him to a hospital, where he died of cardiac arrest after several hours. Sudden cardiac death often happens to middle-aged people who have coronary heart diseases, Sun Hongtao, an associate chief physician at the Fuwai Cardiovascular Hospital in Beijing, told the Global Times on Wednesday. The disease reportedly claims about more than half a million lives in China each year. Despite receiving emergency medical attention, the chance of survival was only about 20-30 percent, Sun said. ""Entertainers are one of the groups with a high risk of sudden cardiac death as they often stay up late and don't have regular work and rest,"" Sun noted. It is very normal for TV show staff, including crew and stars, to stay up late into the night, according to an industry insider who requested anonymity reached by the Global Times. The employee said the stars even work 72 straight hours at times. ""When staying late becomes part of a profession, when risking their lives becomes appropriate…who is going to protect who?""

"One foreigner, one Taiwan man nabbed for alleged involvement in HK riots, endangering China's national securitynPhoto: Xinhua Two individuals were arrested for allegedly engaging in activities endangering China's national security and for their involvement in the Hong Kong riot s, domestic media reported on Saturday, in a latest move which analysts believed the arrest will deter secessionist forces meddling in Hong Kong and fueling political unrest.Lee Meng-chu, a Taiwan resident, was arrested by the national security authorities in Shenzhen, South China's Guangdong Province, for allegedly spying and leaking China's national secrets, according to Guangzhou-based Nanfang Daily.Lee is a an active partaker in secessionist activities in the island of Taiwan, and went to Hong Kong in August to support anti-government protests which have escalated to chaos and violence, the report said. Lee also allegedly sneaked into the mainland and snooped on military secrets.Meanwhile, Lee Henley (Hu Xiang), a foreign national suspected of funding activities threatening China's national security, including allegedly conspiring with foreign forces to support Hong Kong riots, was also arrested by authorities in Guangzhou, according to media reports.The moves came days after the US President Donald Trump signed the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act into a law, at the behest of the US politicians who openly support riots in Hong Kong. The newly passed act will give more room to Washington to impose sanctions on Beijing, in support of Hong Kong protesters many of whom are radical rioters. Photo: Xinhua ""The recent arrest shows that the central government is on high alert on Hong Kong secessionism, along with enhanced law enforcement,"" Tang Fei, member of the council of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told the Global Times.This will also trigger a deterring effect on the Hong Kong and Taiwan secessionist forces who collide with each other to carry on with their illegal activities.The Chinese Foreign Ministry recently criticized the Hong Kong-related act approved by Washington, saying it exposed the malicious and hegemonic nature of the US, which is against the interest of the Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots.It aims to undermine Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, sabotage the ""one country, two systems,"" principle and disrupt the Chinese nation's endeavor to realize great rejuvenation, the ministry said.

"10 mainland movies selected to be broadcast in TaiwannJackie Chan Photo: Li Hao/GT Ten films from the Chinese mainland were randomly selected from a pool of 62 to be released in the island of Taiwan in 2020, while there are no restrictions on films from Taiwan when they are released in the mainland.The 10 chosen movies include Vanguard, starring Jackie Chan, Li Na, directed by Peter Chan, and Ash is Purest White, which was nominated for the main competition of the 71st Cannes International Film Festival in April 2018, according to a report from the Beijing Evening News.An additional 52 movies also applied for a Taiwan release, including Last Later, jointly made by Chinese and Japanese artists, and 27 have been placed on a waiting list. If any of the initially chosen 10 films encounter problems and cannot be broadcast, these 27 movies will have the opportunity to replace them.A quota system in Taiwan for films from the Chinese mainland means that only 10 movies can be released in Taiwan each year. This quota was initially filled according to a first-come-first-served basis, but as the number of applications increased, the process was changed to a lottery system.Analysts say the rule leads to the delayed release of popular movies from the Chinese mainland in Taiwan. For example, Ash is Purest White, which was popular in 2018, will be broadcast in Taiwan after two years when it is already available online.The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council published 31 measures to benefit the island of Taiwan in February 2018, which placing no limits on the number of films and TV series produced in Taiwan that can be introduced in the Chinese mainland.Xin Zhiyu, a producer of TV dramas from Taiwan, said that the beneficial policy can promote cultural exchanges in film and TV between the island and the mainland, and can offer more relevant work opportunities in Taiwan.Global Times "	11/29/19	0	0	0.9732	1
"Death of TV show contestant triggers criticism of physically demanding programsnGodfrey Gao Photo: VCG The death of Taiwan island actor Godfrey Gao on Wednesday while filming a sports entertainment show in Ningbo, East China's Zhejiang Province, has attracted public attention to sudden cardiac death and caused a flood of criticism on social media against physically demanding competitions that can put performers in danger. Gao, 35, collapsed early Wednesday morning while shooting ""Chase Me,"" a program that requires contestants to run and undergo intense physical challenges produced by Zhejiang TV station (Zhejiang STV). Gao's family has flown to Zhejiang and will take Gao's body back to Taiwan on Thursday, media reported. The program's producer said on Sina Weibo they gave Gao emergency medical attention before sending him to a hospital, where he died of cardiac arrest after several hours.

The disease reportedly claims about more than half a million lives in China each year. Despite receiving emergency medical attention, the chance of survival was only about 20-30 percent, Sun said. ""Entertainers are one of the groups with a high risk of sudden cardiac death as they often stay up late and don't have regular work and rest,"" Sun noted. It is very normal for TV show staff, including crew and stars, to stay up late into the night, according to an industry insider who requested anonymity reached by the Global Times.

Shanghai police earlier said Wang is an ex-con who spent time in prison for fraud and is wanted in connection with another fraud case in the city.The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan is using Wang's fraudulent confession to create the illusion that ""the mainland is involved in the elections in Taiwan,"" Zhu said.Zhu noted that many Taiwan people doubt the claims made by DPP authorities, and believe Wang's false confession is being used by the DPP as an election trick.On Saturday, The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Wang had ""defected"" to Australia. The newspaper said Wang was ordered to ""shift his attention from a covert operation to undermine Hong Kong's democracy movement and focus instead on meddling in Taiwan's 2020 elections.""The ultimate aim was to topple Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen, the report said.Wang told the newspaper he holds a Chinese passport (No. EA6120226) with the name Wang Qiang, a Hong Kong permanent resident identity card (No. Z780239) and a South Korean passport (No. M35772699) which he said he used to conduct his alleged espionage.However, Shanghai police said on Sina Weibo Saturday that Wang is wanted for involvement in a fraud case involving 4.6 million yuan ($653,000). He was previously sentenced to 15 months in prison in 2016 for fraud.Wang left for Hong Kong on April 10, the police said, noting that his Chinese passport and Hong Kong permanent resident identity documents were forged. He is said to be 26 years old and from Nanping, East China's Fujian Province and his wife and child live in Australia.The Australian report said Wang is a very senior and important intelligence officer.""How could a 26-year-old man with a wife and son living in Australia be [a spy],"" Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University's Institute of International Relations, told the Global Times.Those working for China's national security departments must pass the civil service examination. Many hold master's or doctorate degree.As Wang was convicted in China, his name and picture have been made public by the court, which is against the confidentiality principle of being intelligence personnel, Li said.The only explanation is that Wang is now conning the Australian government into believing he is a spy in order to get political asylum, Li said.Global Times "	11/27/19	0	0	-0.9609	-1

"Chinese Marine Corps conducts amphibious landing drills, aims to win warsnAmphibious armored vehicles attached to a brigade of the PLA Navy Marine Corps make their way to the beach-head during a maritime amphibious assault training in the west of south China's Guangdong Province on August 17, 2019. (Photo: eng.chinamil.com.cn) The Chinese Marine Corps recently conducted comprehensive amphibious landing drills, in a move which experts said on Sunday aimed at gathering experience and winning wars, and the naval arm is a vanguard in safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the South China Sea and the island of Taiwan.Taking place at an undisclosed location, the drills included the boarding of amphibious armored vehicles onto landing ships and land assault, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Saturday.Upon arriving at the target area, high speed boats first left the landing ships for obstacle clearing and path securing, as naval camouflaged ZTD-05 advanced amphibious assault vehicles followed and launched strikes at targets on the land as they closed in, according to the CCTV report.""From the report we can see that the drills of the Marine Corps are combat-oriented and aim to build an even harsher battlefield environment,"" Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday.""Problems will occur during these drills, and the troops will solve them and overcome difficulties, gaining more experience for future combat, as the drills are based on winning wars,"" Song said.Two ships involved in the drills, one with hull number 913 and the other with 993, are the Baxianshan landing ship from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) East China Sea Fleet and the Luoxiaoshan landing ship from the PLA South China Sea Fleet, according to publicly available reports.Especially capable in amphibious combat, the Marine Corps should be considered a vanguard in safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the South China Sea and the island of Taiwan, Song said.Under the PLA Navy, the Marine Corps is a combined force responsible for amphibious combat including special operations such as reconnaissance, landing and assault, CCTV said.The Chinese military is continuing its development of the Marine Corps, as it has been expanded into a military service of its own, despite remaining under the organization of the Navy, the People's Daily overseas edition's new media platform Xiakedao reported in April.Military analysts said the US Marine Corps is much larger and more capable than China's.Song predicted that the Chinese Marine Corps could get more personnel in addition to getting more advanced equipment, and it should also become capable of joint operations with the Army, Air Force, Rocket Force and other arms of the Navy.The Marine Corps should be able to conduct missions from sea, land and air, Song noted.

"China’s 2nd aircraft carrier to conduct testing and training in South China SeanChina's second aircraft carrier successfully sailed through the Taiwan Straits on Sunday and headed toward a designated area in the South China Sea for testing and training, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy announced on Monday, with experts saying the long voyage from Northeast China could be the last step in the trials phase of the warship which is expected to enter naval service soon.Organizing the domestically built aircraft carrier for this cross-regional testing and training is a normal arrangement in the construction of the carrier, said Cheng Dewei, spokesperson of the PLA Navy, in a video released by the PLA Navy in its Sina Weibo account on Monday.The voyage is not aimed at any specific target, and is not related to other ongoing issues, Cheng said.The yet-to-be-named domestically developed carrier is believed to be on its ninth sea trial after departing the Dalian Shipyard in Northeast China's Liaoning Province since Thursday, Hong Kong-based wenweipo.com reported on Thursday.An anonymous military expert told the Global Times on Monday that conducting a sea trial in the South China Sea will allow the aircraft carrier crew to become familiar with the sea area where it will often sail in the future. The crew is expected to study the southern seas and affirm that the testing done in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea near the Dalian Shipyard remains viable in southern waters.The video shows J-15 carrier-borne fighter jets on the flight deck as the aircraft carrier is being escorted by other naval vessels.Xu Guangyu, a senior consultant at the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told the Global Times that a sea trial involving an aircraft carrier fleet that includes multiple other vessels is needed before the carrier is commissioned.After the sea trial in the South China Sea, the aircraft carrier could sail to a naval port in Sanya, South China's Hainan Province for a commissioning ceremony that will see it finally join the PLA Navy, experts predicted.The port in Sanya hosted China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, in 2013, as it has facilities to meet the needs for hosting all kinds of large naval vessels, the Xinhua News Agency reported in November 2013.The Chaganhu, China's second Type 901 aircraft carrier supply ship, is stationed in the PLA Southern Theater Command Navy, state-owned news website cnr.cn reported on Friday. This is another indication that the second aircraft carrier could be stationed in the south, analysts said.If the domestically developed aircraft carrier is indeed hosted by the Sanya naval port over the long term, the South China Sea will be right at its doorstep, and not far from the island of Taiwan, analysts said.While China is striving to make the South China Sea a sea of peace, some countries from outside the region have been stirring trouble and causing instability, another anonymous expert said, noting that the commissioning of the new aircraft carrier will safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, protect peace in the South China Sea and help China fulfill its responsibility as a major country for regional and world peace.

Photo: screenshot from the Weibo account of the PLA Navy China's second aircraft carrier successfully sailed through the Taiwan Straits on Sunday and headed toward a designated area in the South China Sea for testing and training, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy announced on Monday.Experts said that the trip from Northeast China could be the last step in the trial phase of the warship, which is expected to enter naval service, possibly at a naval base in Sanya, South China's Hainan Province.Preparing the domestically built aircraft carrier for this cross-regional testing and training is a normal arrangement in the construction of the carrier, said Cheng Dewei, spokesperson of the PLA Navy, in a video released by the PLA Navy on its Sina Weibo account on Monday.The trip is not aimed at any specific target, and is not related to other ongoing issues, Cheng said.There is nothing to be surprised about China's warships undergoing routine training at its own doorstep, and others should stop disrupting China's normal military activities, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said at a routine press conference on Monday, in response to a question on China's second aircraft carrier's passage through the Taiwan Straits.The yet-to-be-named domestically developed carrier is believed to be on its ninth sea trial after leaving the Dalian Shipyard in Northeast China's Liaoning Province on Thursday, Hong Kong-based wenweipo.com reported on Thursday. China's second aircraft carrier sails through the Taiwan Straits into the South China Sea on Sunday evening. Photo: screenshot from the Weibo account of the PLA Navy A military expert who asked for anonymity told the Global Times on Monday that conducting a sea trial in the South China Sea will make the aircraft carrier crew become familiar with the area where it will often sail. The crew is expected to study the southern seas and affirm that the testing done in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea near the Dalian Shipyard remains viable in southern waters.The video shows J-15 carrier-borne fighter jets on the flight deck as the aircraft carrier was being escorted by other naval vessels.Xu Guangyu, a senior consultant at the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told the Global Times on Monday that a sea trial involving an aircraft carrier fleet that includes multiple other vessels is needed before the carrier is commissioned.After the sea trial in the South China Sea, the carrier could sail to a naval port in Sanya, South China's Hainan Province for a commissioning ceremony that will see it finally join the PLA Navy, experts predicted.The port in Sanya hosted China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, in 2013, as it has facilities to meet the needs for hosting all kinds of large naval vessels, the Xinhua News Agency reported in November 2013.The Chaganhu, China's second Type 901 aircraft carrier supply ship, is stationed in the PLA Southern Theater Command Navy, state-owned news website cnr.cn reported on Friday. This is another indication that the second aircraft carrier could be stationed in the south, analysts said.If the domestically developed aircraft carrier is indeed hosted by the Sanya naval port over the long term, the South China Sea will be right at its doorstep, and not far from the island of Taiwan, analysts said.China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, is based in Qingdao, East China's Shandong Province. While an aircraft carrier should be able to mobilize to distance waters, just as the Liaoning has sailed to the South China Sea and even passed the Miyako Strait in the past, having one based in South China will allow faster reaction time if the South China Sea requires a Chinese carrier's presence, analysts said, noting that the Liaoning can then focus more on the east.While China is striving to make the South China Sea a sea of peace, some countries from outside the region have been stirring trouble and causing instability, another Chinese expert said, noting that the commissioning of the new aircraft carrier will safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, protect peace in the South China Sea and help China fulfill its responsibility as a major country for regional and world peace.Observers noted that as China's naval strength grows, it will naturally and constantly show up at important occasions around the globe, but is not about flexing muscle or following any political agenda as some countries are used to doing.

A similar exercise was held in Nanjing, capital of East China's Jiangsu Province in November 2018.China and the US are also participants of a land-based joint counter-terrorism drill held by ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus) countries which kicked off on Wednesday in Guilin, South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.Maintaining good military ties has a very positive impact on the overall relations between the two countries, Wei Dongxu said.Minister Wei and Esper made telephone contact on November 5 in which both sides stressed the importance of communication, cooperation and stability, according to statements from the Chinese Defense Ministry and US Defense Department.The Chinese minister also expressed China's principles and position on questions related to the island of Taiwan, the South China Sea, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, reads the Chinese Defense Ministry statement.The US has frequently sent naval vessels and aircraft through the Taiwan Straits and into the South China Sea over the past year in the name of freedom of navigation.China has been exercising restraint so no military confrontation have taken place between China and the US, a military expert who asked not to be named told the Global Times.While both sides wish for stable and cooperative military relations, these US moves are testing China's patience and risk breaking the stabilizer, the expert said, noting the US should stop before it is too late.

"China issues patriotism education guidelinenPeople wave the Chinese national flag and the flag of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region(HKSAR) at a pier in Tsim Sha Tsui of Hong Kong, south China, Aug 8, 2019.Photo:Xinhua China launched a guideline to implement patriotic education in a new era, calling for a focus on the youth, enhanced education on national unity and implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" principle amid ongoing riots in Hong Kong, for which some Chinese experts believe the city's twisted education on the mainland should take part of the responsibility.The guideline is the first systematic summary and normative statement on patriotism education, which shows China's determination to enhance Chinese people's confidence in the country and unite the Chinese nation, Chu Zhaohui, a research fellow at the Beijing-based National Institute of Education Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Released on Tuesday, the guideline contains recommendations on providing education on the culture and history of China and the Communist Party of China as well as on national security and national defense.It said patriotic education will focus particularly on the youth and done through schools, calling for innovative methods like online classes, music and drama works to promote it.New forms of media platforms like short videos and live-streaming should be applied to provide wider range and flexible options for patriotic education, which would be more attractive to teenagers. Xuexiqiangguo, a widely-used Party theory learning app, should play an important role in the education, the guideline said.Patriotic education is not the same as rigid preaching. It covers a broad range of content, like love for the Party, the nation, the people and the culture, Zhu Wei, a communications researcher at the China University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Experts noted that the guideline comes amid prolonged violent actions in Hong Kong which are mostly launched by local youths and have devastated the city, during which rioters have desecrated national flag and emblem.The guideline called for enhanced education on the implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" principle to guide people from the regions of Hong Kong and Macao and the Taiwan island to increase national identity and conscientiously uphold national unity.China will seriously deal with disrespect to the national anthem, flag and emblem, as well as actions infringing on the reputation of national heroes and martyrs, damaging patriotic education facilities, publicizing and glamorizing aggressive wars. Secessionism, violence, terrorism and other acts that endanger the state and social stability shall be severely punished.In the more than five months of violence in Hong Kong, some young people in the city have shown their lack of respect and love for the country like treading on national flags, throwing national flags into the sea and defacing the national emblem.Experts believe that something went wrong with Hong Kong's textbooks, which lack the correct description of the mainland, misleading teenagers and intellectuals.They called for better communication between young people from the mainland and those from Hong Kong and the Taiwan island to enhance the latter's knowledge of the mainland.A Global Times reporter learned from local students and parents that some high school and college textbooks in Hong Kong included anti-mainland content. Some also publicly supported the 2014 illegal ""Occupy Central"" movement and challenged certain policies of the central government. "	11/13/19	0	0	0.9381	1

Photo: IC Italian luxury carmaker Maserati has suspended ties with the Golden Horse Awards on the island of Taiwan, stressing to uphold the one-China principle, soon after media revealed that it re-sponsored the awards mired in politics.Observers said the company's decision to cut its sponsorship of the awards is consistent with Chinese mainland public opinion, a key overseas market for the company.Maserati announced on its Sina Weibo on Wednesday that sponsorship is determined by local distributors and does not represent the company's official position.The company had required distributors to suspend all ties with the awards, and vowed to strengthen supervision to prevent such an incident from happening again, according to its announcement.""Maserati always respects China's territorial integrity, history and culture, and firmly upholds the one-China principle,"" the announcement said.The Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival's official website said the Maserati brand was removed from the sponsors list.The announcement came after the China Film Administration in August banned mainland movies and artists from participating in November's 56th festival, a week after the mainland authorities halted a pilot program for individual mainland tourists from 47 cities to visit Taiwan due to the current cross-Straits ties.Another Italian luxury brand Bvlgari, Chinese mobile phone brand OPPO and Piaget also pulled out of the festival, Hong Kong media Singtao Daily reported on August 26.Mainland film industry insiders linked the prohibition to secessionist comments made by Taiwan filmmaker Fu Yu.At last year's awards ceremony, Fu expressed her support for the secession of Taiwan in her acceptance speech for her award-winning documentary, ""Our Youth in Taiwan,"" which tells the story of the anti-mainland Sunflower Student Movement.However, the festival organizers did not warn Fu for politicizing the cultural event. Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen even expressed her support for Fu on her Facebook account.Foreign companies which enter the Chinese market should respect local consumers' sentiments, Shi Wenxue, a Beijing-based film critic, told the Global Times on Thursday.Maserati's move could be seen as catering to public opinion, Shi said.China has become the company's largest market worldwide, overtaking the US, in 2017.According to a March report by the Wall Street Journal, Maserati dealers in China have almost doubled to 96 in the past four years.

Taiwan-funded enterprises can also enjoy the same trade security measures and remedies as mainland enterprises.Qualified Taiwan financial institutes and companies are also entitled to apply for financial guarantees from local governments in the Chinese mainland.Many people on the island of Taiwan are concerned if the Cross-Straits Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), a deal that benefited Taiwan for about 10 years, would be renewed, Yang noted.""Unfortunately, due to reasons known to all, negotiations on the signing of the follow-up service between the two sides have been interrupted. The agreement cannot benefit more Taiwan compatriots,"" Ma said at a routine press conference on Wednesday.Yang said the recent measures can also serve as complimentary ones to boost cross-Strait economic exchanges, if the ECFA cannot be renewed due to Taiwan pro-independence forces' muddling.In February 2018, the Taiwan Affairs Office announced the ""31 Measures"" related to entities in Taiwan. The measures - drafted by 30 government departments - are intended to provide better opportunities for businesses and individuals from Taiwan in the Chinese mainland. "	11/4/19	0	0	0.9951	1
"Lu Hsiu-lien’s bid for regional leadership shows divisions among Taiwan secessionists: expertsnPhoto: IC RELATED ARTICLES: Abandoning Taiwan reflects a trend Lu Hsiu-lien, the former vice regional leader of the island of Taiwan, announced on Monday that she will join the race for the 2020 Taiwan regional leadership election as an independent candidate, which shows the internal strife among Taiwan secessionists, experts said.According to a report from Taiwan's Central News Agency, Lu was advised to run by the radical-secessionism party Formosa Alliance and other small parties on the island.At a press conference held by Formosa Alliance on Tuesday, Lu stated that Taiwan suffers when people elect the wrong leader, adding that in the 2020 election, many people in Taiwan will vote with a sense of anxiety.Analysts believe Lu was hinting at Taiwan's ""diplomatic separation"" with the Solomon Islands on Monday and other problems since the current leader of Taiwan island Tsai Ing-wen took over in 2016.""Lu has almost no chance of winning the election in 2020. Her participation is mainly for promoting her idea of Taiwan secessionism and increasing the sense of political presence,"" Yang Lixian, a research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center of Cross-Straits Relations, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Lu's announcement that she will take part in the Taiwan region leader's race came at almost the same time as the Taiwan business tycoon Terry Gou announced his withdrawal from the election.Gou was defeated by KMT party candidate Han Kuo-yu in the party's primary poll by nearly 20 percent.Observers said that the two incidents are a positive signal for Han's election to some extent, as Gou's withdrawal will strengthen the KMT's solidarity while Lu's run for regional leadership reflects the discord among the green camp.Yu Keli, director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Taiwan Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday that Lu's candidacy will have a negative impact for Tsai, who was also named as a candidate for the 2020 leader's election.It reflects the split in the green camp, and the huge disappointment toward Tsai from the green camp, Yu noted.

"Trump’s move on Kurds sparks concern on Taiwan islandnChinese demonstrators sing songs and chant slogans while waiting for the arrival of Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen in Los Angeles on Sunday. As Tsai arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel, she was greeted by peaceful Chinese demonstrators of all ages and from all walks of life. They were holding flags, banners and signs bearing the slogan ""One China."" The crowd began chanting ""One China!"" and ""Oppose Taiwan Independence!"" as Tsai pulled into the hotel. Photo: Wang Rujun People on Taiwan island have been confused by two different voices - ""relying on the US for security"" versus ""the US is untrustworthy."" After US President Donald Trump took office in 2017, the ""America First"" doctrine became the core of the country's foreign policy. Trump haggles over every ounce with US allies and even sacrifices their interests to serve ""America First."" In October, Trump abandoned Americans partners in the majority Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces, which fought the Islamic State side by side with US troops. Trump's move has drawn strong opposition from within the US and concerned Taiwan island.Some pointed out that under Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen's policy of relying on the US to confront the Chinese mainland, the island is more dependent on the US than the Kurds while facing uncertain future because of Trump.At the end of 1978, then US president Jimmy Carter announced to end diplomatic relations with the island and withdraw troops from there. This was regarded on the island as a historical record of the US abandoning Taiwan. Since then, similar decisions have been made or proposed in the US and concerned the island.Some Americans believe that the Taiwan question can be used as a bargaining chip to make a big deal with China. Others argue that China's determination for reunification will not change, so that eventually abandoning the island will allow the US to avoid getting involved in a military conflict across the Taiwan Straits.The Tsai administration refused to recognize the 1992 Consensus and promoted ""Taiwan independence"" to escalate cross-Straits tensions. Some American scholars believe Tsai's separatism will lead to unpredictable cross-Straits conflicts, and the US should keep distance from the island, a ""time bomb,"" to prevent it from backfiring. From this perspective, the theory of US abandoning Taiwan is aimed at gradually reducing and terminating the country's commitment to the island with US national interests as the starting point.Amid China-US strategic games and strained ties between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan island, residents on the island increasingly distrust the Trump administration, worrying that they will be used as a bargaining chip by the US and even be sold some day in the future in exchange for trade cooperation with China.Besides, they worry that the US won't risk giving them a hand if the Chinese mainland determines to solve the Taiwan question for good. Although the US approved the Taiwan Relations Act and sells weapons to the island based on it, the Act didn't state clearly whether the US will help defend the island. The gap in military strength between China and the US has narrowed since the Taiwan Straits crisis in 1996, and the US military is unable to effectively defend the island anymore.The Trump administration has included Taiwan in the Indo-Pacific strategy and the forefront of strategic competition with China, and thus triggered reflection on the island: Is this consistent with Taiwan's interests? In particular, Taiwan residents are worried that Tsai's one-sided policy toward the US will push the island into the vortex of a China-US contention, hurting itself before benefiting.In recent years, the island's society has clearly felt that when the Trump administration frequently plays the Taiwan card against the Chinese mainland, including announcing arms sales to the island, signing Taiwan-related bills and promoting mutual high-level exchanges, Taiwan actually loses more. The island's space for international activities has been shrinking.The Trump administration's support for Taiwan is mainly in service of US strategic needs. The Tsai administration has promised to purchase more US agricultural products to cater to the Trump administration but failed to bring the US to the table for a free trade agreement. In contrast, the island is becoming increasingly marginalized in regional economic growth.The Tsai administration's complete reliance on the US and actively being the latter's chess piece have met with more suspicions on the island. The Kuomintang and mayor of Taipei Ko Wen-je, who is chairman of the Taiwan People's Party, all criticized Tsai's policy for putting Taiwan in danger and making the island a pawn of the US.In the future, the power gap between China and the US will continue to narrow, and their respective influence on the cross-Straits situation will undergo major changes. Voices calling the US unreliable will grow louder on the island.The author is an associate research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	10/30/19	1	0	-0.42	-1
"US urged to stop interfering in China's internal affairs with Taiwan-related billsnMa Xiaoguang, spokesperson of Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council The provocative Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act that is set for review on Wednesday at the US House of Representatives is essentially symbolic and passing the bill will make no difference other than the US shooting its own feet again, Chinese observers said on Wednesday.The overwhelming international trend of severing ""diplomatic ties"" with the island of Taiwan and switching diplomatic recognition to China based on the one-China principle is irreversible, they noted.Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council reiterated on Wednesday that China resolutely opposes US interference in Taiwan and the country's internal affairs by passing a series of so-called Taiwan-related bills, as the US House of Representatives is expected to review the so-called ""TAIPEI Act.""Ma made the statement during a Wednesday press conference when asked to comment on the likely passing of the TAIPEI Act, which stipulates the US government will take active measures to support the island of Taiwan, reinforcing the unofficial US ties with the island.A previous version of the bill was passed by the US Senate on Tuesday and was scheduled to be reviewed Wednesday by the House of Representatives.The Taiwan authorities' pursuit of ""diplomatic ties"" is nothing but daydreaming and will never happen, Ma told the media on Wednesday.The bill states that the US government should consider increasing ""its economic, security, and diplomatic engagement with nations that have demonstrably strengthened, enhanced or upgraded relations with Taiwan"" and reduce those with nations ""that take serious or significant actions to undermine Taiwan.""""The bill itself showcases US congressmen's arrogance and ignorance of the world major trend,"" said Xin Qiang, deputy director of the center for US studies at Fudan University in Shanghai on Wednesday.""The small number of nations that remain 'diplomatic relations' with the island would continue to choose to turn to mainland for the sake of their own interests, regardless of US empty coercion on paper.

And passing without practicing would further reveal the US power decline worldwide.""The island of Taiwan has lost seven ""allies"" since 2016 when Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen was elected to office.A Chinese observer said the US bill would achieve the effect of bolstering Taiwan's capability of securing its remaining ""allies,"" noting that ""the cross-Straits relations have for some time not for the US to decide, and it is totally up to the mainland which holds absolutely military advantage over the Taiwan side and sees addressing the Taiwan question as its core interests rather than a pawn or negotiation bargain to play at wills.""Ma the spokesperson also warned that ""the current Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party administration is playing along with the US as it uses the 'Taiwan card,' which will only harm cross-Straits peace, and undermine the interests of compatriots on both sides, especially those from Taiwan.""Xin also said that the Taiwan DPP administration might take such development of US ""rewards of goodwills,"" to use the bill as vote-bait in upcoming island election, but they must be aware that they are far from being capable to ""play US card,"" otherwise the pro-secession path they take would only backfire on them, further damaging the prosperity and interests of the island.

(Xinhua/Lu Hanxin) China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government on Friday called on Taiwan authorities to clear the hurdle for the smooth entry of the Taiwan homicide case suspect Chan Tong-kai as soon as possible and return the handling of the case to the judicial system.""We hope Taiwan authorities could show its sincerity, understand and facilitate Chan's wish to shoulder criminal responsibility so as to let the rule of law and justice prevail,"" the HKSAR government said in a statement.Taiwan should not irresponsibly question Chan's motivation and politicize the case, as Chan is a remorseful young man and he is willing to face his guilt, the statement said.Chan, a Hong Kong resident accused by Taiwan authorities of killing his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan last year, was released Wednesday morning after serving his prison term in Hong Kong for money laundering.The homicide case in Taiwan prompted Hong Kong authorities to propose amendments on two ordinances concerning the transfer of fugitive offenders, given the lack of arrangement between the two regions.Regarding Chan's decision to voluntarily face trial in Taiwan, Hong Kong has contacted Taiwan's relevant authorities and communicated with the latter on the relevant arrangements, the statement said.As Chan has served his sentence and has been discharged from prison, he is currently a free man in Hong Kong, the HKSAR government said in the statement.""With regard to when he will go to Taiwan, it is Chan's decision,"" it said, adding that the HKSAR government must respect his wish and cannot force him against his will.The HKSAR government reiterated that Chan's decision to turn in himself to Taiwan is out of his own free will, saying it has nothing to do with the so-called ""political maneuvering"".Chan's decision should be regarded as a necessary account to the deceased and her family members, as well as out of respect to Taiwan's legal system, it said.""We hope that Taiwan authorities would handle the case pragmatically to allow this young man to have a fair trial and give him an opportunity for self-redemption,"" it said.Upholding the rule of law and acting in accordance with the law has always been the stance of Hong Kong and this has never changed, the statement noted.Taiwan should respect Hong Kong's adoption of territoriality principle in respect of criminal jurisdiction in its judicial system, and stop misleading the public by wrongly accusing Hong Kong of failing to exercise its jurisdiction over the case, it said.Rejecting Taiwan authorities' comments that Chan was not on trial in Hong Kong as ""totally unfounded"", the HKSAR government said Chan had already faced trial in the Hong Kong court and was convicted and sentenced to jail.

And following that, mainland filmmakers and actors did not attend a dinner in protest that same evening.The festival will be in a ""very awkward position"" without Chinese mainland personnel and movies, as ""more and more movies from the Chinese mainland are winning applause worldwide and are making their presence in the film festival,""Shao Zhong-hai, a former head of the school of social sciences at Chinese Culture University in Taiwan, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Politics has affected the judgment of this film festival in recent years, asserted Shi Wenxue, a teacher at Beijing Film Academy.""Film personnel in the mainland used to take the festival as an 'art palace,' while some people in Taiwan take it as 'chance to preach politics,'"" Shi told the Global Times on Wednesday.The festival is losing its appeal on the Chinese mainland anyway, Shi said, noting that without the participation of Chinese mainland films, it is just a ""self-entertaining regional festival.""Even before the Chinese mainland film authority's statement, many Chinese mainland filmmakers already made it clear they would steer clear of this year's festival, Shi said.The Zhang Yimou movie One Second and Lyceum Theatre, starring Gong Li, were not registered for the festival, according to previous media reports.Awards from this festival are ""just a bonus,"" said a Chinese mainland independent film director, who requested anonymity.It is more important for filmmakers from the Chinese mainland to make a gesture and fight back against inappropriate behavior and comments by some artists at the festival, he said.The Chinese mainland ban sends a tough message against secessionists, Yang Lixian, a research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center of Cross-Straits Relations, told the Global Times.The executive committee of the Golden Horse Awards informed the Global Times Wednesday that they regretted the ban but festival activities would continue as usual.

"DPP eyes political gains from murder casenChan Tong-kai, the suspect of a homicide case in China's Taiwan, was released from jail in Hong Kong, South China, on October 23, after serving prison term for money laundering. Photo: IC RELATED ARTICLES: Taiwan authority is politicizing murder case Chan Tong-kai was released from prison Wednesday. He apologized for killing his girlfriend and reiterated his willingness to go to Taiwan to surrender. Just before he was discharged, the Taiwan authorities who had publicly refused to accept him suddenly changed their stance and announced that they would send their law enforcement officers to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) to escort Chan to the island of Taiwan for trial.However, since the Taiwan law enforcement agents have no right to enforce law in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong SAR government rejected its request. It was a murder case based on clear evidence, but has become complicated. Although Chan has been wanted in Taiwan and the suspect is willing to surrender, he cannot be tried in Taiwan. It is absurd.Too many political elements are involved in this case. The Hong Kong SAR government proposed the extradition bill following this murder case, but the incident was turned into a bigger movement by the Hong Kong opposition, severely deviating from the original intention. Now, there is even no suitable place to put Chan on trial.Between the Hong Kong and Taiwan governments, which side is the one politicizing the case? The answer is clear from which side is benefiting from causing political turbulence since the start of the anti-extradition bill movement. Hong Kong suffered a series of political consequences from the fallout of Chan's case, while Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority has gained politically.How Chan's case will proceed may not help the Hong Kong government cope with the current situation, but how to expand the positive factors from Chan's case would be a ""major decision"" for the DPP as next year's election is approaching.Chan would be a free man in Hong Kong after being released from prison, but he is willing to surrender in Taiwan. Therefore, the case will return to Taiwan's jurisdiction if Taiwan prosecutors arrest him at the airport. The first reaction of the Taiwan authorities, however, was that they could not receive Chan, claiming that his surrender was manipulated.The Tsai Ing-wen authorities later completely reversed their decision, throwing out a plan to dispatch Taiwan's law enforcement officers to Hong Kong to arrest and escort Chan back.Nevertheless, it would not be hard to see that this is another trick being played by the Taiwan government, which is scheming to claim its ""sovereignty"" by carrying out law enforcement in Hong Kong.Even Chinese mainland police face legal obstacles related to Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy if they want to detain fugitives in Hong Kong and bring them to the mainland for trial. How could Taiwan law enforcement agents have no legal problems when they want to go to Hong Kong to enforce the law and take suspects away?The Hong Kong government promoted the extradition bill to establish a legal framework and resolve the institutional obstacles to the extradition of fugitives. Unfortunately, the bill ended up causing widespread turmoil in Hong Kong.In the process, the Taiwan authorities have not only aggravated the ""anti-extradition bill"" movement, but have taken advantage of the incident for winning more votes for Tsai and DPP that adopt a radical political line.Will Chan finally be able to surrender in Taiwan? It depends to what extent Taiwan's public opinion has been kidnapped by the Tsai authorities. Whether justice or politics wins remains to be seen. "	10/23/19	0	0	-0.8546	-1

"HK murder suspect Chan releasednPhoto: Chan walks out after his release on Wednesday morning. Photo: Screenshot from now.com Hong Kong resident Chan Tong-kai, who is suspected of murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan, was released from prison in Hong Kong on Wednesday morning, after serving time for money laundering in the city.Outside the prison, Chan bowed and said that he wants to be tried in Taiwan for his alleged crime, media reports said.Chan's murder case prompted the proposed - and now withdrawn - extradition bill that has sparked months of unrests in Hong Kong.Chan had previously told the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government, through Peter Koon Ho-ming, Provincial Secretary General of the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui, the Anglican Church in Hong Kong and Macao, that he was willing to surrender himself to the island of Taiwan.However, the Taiwan authorities tried to obstruct the surrender for political reasons and election interests, and claimed Chan's surrender was the result of manipulation.""I believe it is impossible that Chan was manipulated to surrender. Not only Chan but his family has also been pondering the matter for quite a long time,"" Koon told the Global Time in an exclusive interview on Tuesday.The HKSAR government early on Wednesday issued a statement in response to Taiwan's statement on Tuesday that it wanted to send officers to Hong Kong to escort Chan to Taiwan upon his release from prison, saying that the HKSAR government sees the case as cross-jurisdiction law enforcement, and Taiwan's request is disrespectful of Hong Kong's jurisdictional powers and is totally unacceptable.The HKSAR government strongly objects to the Taiwan side's irresponsible allegation that Chan's decision to surrender was a result of political maneuvering, the statement said.""The homicide case took place in Taiwan.

"No govt action involved in HK murder suspect's surrender to Taiwan: pastornRioters commit vandalism in Kowloon, Hong Kong on October 6. Photo: Xinhua Murder suspect Chan Tong-kai, who prompted the proposal of the extradition bill that sparked months of unrest in Hong Kong, is due to be released from prison in Hong Kong on Wednesday. He recently expressed his willingness to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government to turn himself in to the island of Taiwan through Peter Koon Ho-ming, Provincial Secretary General of the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui, the Anglican Church in Hong Kong and Macao. However, the Tsai Ing-wen administration has tried to obstruct the surrender for political reasons and election interests, and claimed Chan's surrender was the result of manipulation. Global Times reporter Li Sikun (GT) on Tuesday had an exclusive interview with Peter Koon (Koon), and he discussed the details of Chan's consent to surrender.I began reaching out to Chan six months ago and have been visiting him roughly once a week. As for why I started contacting Chan, it was because Chan was an alumnus of my high school. So when I learned about what happened to him, I wanted to see for myself because I didn't think he was that bad. Any other person, you know, if they fled back home they would deny [the murder] but he admitted to the crime and revealed where he hid the body. All these left the Hong Kong government no choice but to think of a way to [solve the problem]. Hong Kong has no legal jurisdiction, so the government came up with the idea of an extradition bill, which led to the current situation. As tensions escalated, I wanted to visit the child. I knew he is young, only 19 years old.My first impression of him was that he never thought of evading the whole thing. As for turning himself in to Taiwan authorities, he had this thought initially but couldn't make up his mind. After all, he wasn't familiar with local life in Taiwan, its judicial procedures, or prison conditions. So I said to him, maybe we could discuss it. So I travelled to Taiwan and hired a lawyer there. Of course we need to communicate with his parents first to figure out the whole thing.Later on, Chan's father went to Taiwan to speak to the lawyer. Afterwards, I invited the lawyer to Hong Kong to talk to Chan. About a month or so ago, Chan eventually accepted the idea of turning himself in to Taiwan authorities.We have been asking about his thoughts all the time. Roughly a month ago, in a personal meeting, he told me that he has decided to go back to Taiwan and asked me to make relevant arrangements. So I went to Taiwan and later they wouldn't allow me to go anymore. There was really nothing about my trips to Taiwan. I wanted to make arrangements so I can continue visiting Chan. I want to be there for him the whole process. I don't want to just ""leave"" him there. After all, I was the one who talked him into surrendering. I believe I am responsible for him. So I asked Taiwan authorities to allow me to visit him in prison and to continue guiding him spiritually. There was no political motive at all as they had speculated. I want to help him with his faith because Chan was baptized in prison.I believe it is impossible that Chan was manipulated to surrender. To say that he was manipulated to surrender means that he was forced to turn himself in. That's impossible. Not only Chan but his family has also been pondering the matter for quite a long time. They might not have imagined that the case could spiral into such a crisis and to have been politicized.The case was initially a simple case. Chan made a mistake. He didn't mean to kill the girl. They were a couple and he is young. We hope he can have a good attitude toward confession. Now that he is willing to return to Taiwan, we hope the Taiwan authorities, courts and judges could offer him a chance to start over again after he serves his term.I have always encouraged him to turn himself in. It is really a pity that the situation has developed in such a direction.Based on the early legal advice from a Taiwan-based lawyer, if Chan confesses, he will not [face the death penalty.] If a person surrenders, there is no ground to hand down the maximum sentence. So unless the case is really brutal and serious or has caused death to a lot of lives, it is not likely that the death penalty will apply.He feels very helpless and certainly upset. It is something that he should do. We all encourage him to face it. After knowing his request was rejected, he did not say much. I could see he was very upset at that moment.It is true to some extent. But on the other hand, he reads the news and feels puzzled why things are always changing. The remarks by Taiwan authorities and the issues about the death penalty all affected his mood a lot.He always wants to atone himself. On one hand, he did something wrong, then he must be responsible for it. But on the other hand, he hopes the judge could give him a chance to make a fresh start in life because he is still young and his act was unintentional.Of course, he understands. Taiwan's lawyer also told him that imprisonment of not less than ten years is certain. He accepts that. He has no objection on a fixed term of imprisonment but he doesn't accept the death penalty because his act was unintentional.Yes, Hong Kong doesn't have jurisdiction, so he was only sentenced for money laundering, 20-30 months in jail at most.I don't know, it depends on the situation.I think he feels guilty to the Hong Kong people. I told him not to mind it too much. His case is a blasting fuse but we can't just blame Chan. At this stage, the situation is totally out of control, and he can't do anything to change it either. So I always tell him not to think too much about it.I won't comment too much on the details of the meeting. But as for the so-called description that says I was dispatched by the Communist Party of China, that's definitely not true.There is absolutely no government action involved in it. Neither the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government nor the central government asked me to do that.In fact, this matter is very simple. Chan and the dead are students of the same school in Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui (HKSKH is the Anglican Church in Hong Kong and Macao). I want to say something because I hope the deceased could get rest while the living can turn over a new leaf.I am a religious believer and also a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). The CPPCC is only an advisory body and many religious leaders are members of the CPPCC.I am a pastor. I want people to change and have the opportunity to make a fresh start in life. This is my ultimate goal, and I don't want them to think too much.I have no clue.I am also really puzzled and don't quite understand. I can't answer that because it is mainly the communication between the HKSAR government and the Taiwan authorities. "	10/23/19	0	0	-0.1497	-1
"Taiwan regional authority reverses decision on murder suspect amid public pressurenRioters damage facilities on the Jordan Road in Hong Kong on Sunday. Photo: Xinhua Taiwan's regional authority on Tuesday reversed its rejection of the offer to surrender by the murder suspect Chan Tong-kai from Hong Kong, a move that analysts said was a result of pressure from public opinion and disapproval of the island authorities' attempt to politicize the judicial issue.Speaking at a press conference in Taipei on Tuesday, officials from Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said that it hopes Hong Kong will assist in bringing Chan back for trial in Taiwan and will not let a serious crime go unpunished, Taiwan-based China Times reported Tuesday.The council said that it had required the Hong Kong authorities to offer judicial help many times since the case happened last year and it is also willing to provide evidence to the Hong Kong regional government, but the latter showed no willingness to start a trial for the case.Previously, the Taiwan authority had rejected Chan's surrender as they believed it was the result of manipulation or political motives by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government.Hong Kong and the island of Taiwan have been tussling over Chan's case for some time.Hong Kong Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said on Tuesday morning that it was baffling that the island of Taiwan had rejected Chan's surrender, and urged Taiwan not to put politics over justice.At Tuesday's media briefing, Cheung reiterated that no political manipulation was involved in Chan's case, and said he hoped that the Taiwan authorities won't complicate the issue and try to exploit politics at the expense of justice.Zhu Songling, a professor with the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Beijing Union University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that Taiwan's decision could be seen as a surrender to strong calls from the public and legal circles in the island not to politicize the issue and return it to the law.It shows that the Tsai Ing-wen administration's intention to politicize the issue is unpopular with the people, Zhu noted.The administration's rejection of Chan's surrender resulted in a backlash in the island as well as in Hong Kong. The media and politicians criticized the behavior as ""dodging responsibility"" and politicizing a legal issue.Former Taiwan leader Ma Ying-jeou said on his Facebook account on Tuesday that he was sad about the rejection, which revealed that Tsai's administration was more interested in votes than justice.Chan is wanted in Taiwan on murder charges and stands accused of killing his pregnant girlfriend during a holiday early last year. He later returned to Hong Kong, where he was arrested and convicted of money laundering. He is due to be released on Wednesday. "	10/23/19	0	0	-0.9923	-1

Now that he is willing to return to Taiwan, we hope the Taiwan authorities, courts and judges could offer him a chance to start over again after he serves his term.I have always encouraged him to turn himself in. It is really a pity that the situation has developed in such a direction.Based on the early legal advice from a Taiwan-based lawyer, if Chan confesses, he will not [face the death penalty.] If a person surrenders, there is no ground to hand down the maximum sentence. So unless the case is really brutal and serious or has caused death to a lot of lives, it is not likely that the death penalty will apply.He feels very helpless and certainly upset. It is something that he should do. We all encourage him to face it. After knowing his request was rejected, he did not say much. I could see he was very upset at that moment.It is true to some extent. But on the other hand, he reads the news and feels puzzled why things are always changing. The remarks by Taiwan authorities and the issues about the death penalty all affected his mood a lot.He always wants to atone himself. On one hand, he did something wrong, then he must be responsible for it. But on the other hand, he hopes the judge could give him a chance to make a fresh start in life because he is still young and his act was unintentional.Of course, he understands. Taiwan's lawyer also told him that imprisonment of not less than ten years is certain. He accepts that. He has no objection on a fixed term of imprisonment but he doesn't accept the death penalty because his act was unintentional.Yes, Hong Kong doesn't have jurisdiction, so he was only sentenced for money laundering, 20-30 months in jail at most.I don't know, it depends on the situation.I think he feels guilty to the Hong Kong people. I told him not to mind it too much. His case is a blasting fuse but we can't just blame Chan. At this stage, the situation is totally out of control, and he can't do anything to change it either. So I always tell him not to think too much about it.I won't comment too much on the details of the meeting. But as for the so-called description that says I was dispatched by the Communist Party of China, that's definitely not true.There is absolutely no government action involved in it. Neither the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government nor the central government asked me to do that.In fact, this matter is very simple. Chan and the dead are students of the same school in Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui (HKSKH is the Anglican Church in Hong Kong and Macao). I want to say something because I hope the deceased could get rest while the living can turn over a new leaf.I am a religious believer and also a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). The CPPCC is only an advisory body and many religious leaders are members of the CPPCC.I am a pastor. I want people to change and have the opportunity to make a fresh start in life. This is my ultimate goal, and I don't want them to think too much.I have no clue.I am also really puzzled and don't quite understand. I can't answer that because it is mainly the communication between the HKSAR government and the Taiwan authorities. "	10/23/19	0	0	-0.1497	-1

The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital (HKU-SZ Hospital) in South China's Guangdong Province has officially been linked with the country's major organ donation volunteer online registration platform, which is administered by the China Organ Transplant Development Foundation.Huang Jiefu, former vice minister of health and current head of the foundation, told the Global Times on Monday that he hopes that Hong Kong residents will be able to have organ transplant operations in the HKU-SZ hospital in the future.Volunteers including the hospital patients and residents from the mainland as well as those from the country's Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions are now able to register their organ donation willingness with the platform via the hospital's WeChat public account, Shenzhen's local media reported on Monday.Zhao Hongtao, the secretary general of the foundation, said the hospital will play a bridging role between Hong Kong residents and mainland residents, as the hospital is well trusted by Hong Kong patients since it has a strong connection with the University of Hong Kong.""The HKU-SZ Hospital is operated well with a management team from the University of Hong Kong. Therefore it is already popular among Hong Kong residents, who can enjoy a cluster of favorable policies at the hospital from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority,"" Zhao told the Global Times on Monday.According to data Zhao provided to the Global Times on Monday, from 2010 to 2018, residents from Hong Kong, Macao and the island of Taiwan have had 1,155 organ transplant operations in the mainland, including 676 for Hong Kong residents. And as of the end of 2018, 536 residents from these regions were on the waiting list, including 313 from Hong Kong. In 2018, two Hong Kong residents made organ donations.As of Monday, more than 1.13 million volunteers have registered with the foundation. "	10/21/19	0	0	0.9819	1

"Surrender of HK murder suspect comes on his own accord: HK govtnMasked rioters hurl petro bombs in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong on August 31, 2019. Photo: Xinhua Hong Kong Special Administration Region (HKSAR) government denied false accusation Sunday that it influenced a suspect wanted for the alleged murder of his girlfriend who said earlier he is willing to hand himself over to Taiwan authorities.Chan Tong-kai, suspected of allegedly murdering his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan and supposedly the reason Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam introduced the extradition bill, is considered to be the fuse that sparked the ongoing chaos in Hong Kong.In a letter to the city's leader, Chan said he would voluntarily hand himself over to Taiwan authorities after his release Wednesday.Facing accusations that claimed Chan was forced to surrender, HK government officials posted a statement Sunday on their website noting his decision was made without outside influence.The statement also said the HK government respects the rule of law and has always acted in accordance. Hong Kong does not have a law that allows Chan to be transferred to Taiwan, nor is there one on how to cooperate with Taiwan on criminal procedures.As Chan's surrender is voluntary, Taiwan will handle the case according to their legal procedures on voluntary surrender.The HK administration conveyed Chan's decision to Taiwanese authorities, and said it is willing to offer legal assistance during the investigation.Chan is serving a 29-month sentence for money laundering and could be released as early as Wednesday.Sing Tao Daily reported that Chan was remorseful after learning the extradition bill sparked social unrest.Chan said he hoped his surrender would ease tensions and restore calm in Hong Kong.Taiwan lawyers met with Chan earlier to discuss his case and familiarize him with their judicial process and prison conditions.Global Times "	10/20/19	0	0	-0.9716	-1
"Hong Kong enters 20th week of unrestnHK police fire water cannons with blue water and tear gas to dispel protesters illegally assembled in Mong Kok on Sunday. Photo: Wang Cong/GT Thousands of protesters took to Hong Kong's streets on Sunday defying a police ban on the assembly and once again turning the city into a theater for violence.During a rainless afternoon, protesters formed a phalanx of umbrellas in the narrow streets of Kowloon area. Some wore masks, despite a government ban. They asked journalists not to take their pictures, apparently showing their awareness of the law.Nearby stores were again closed for business, and security guards appeared to be on high alert outside shopping malls.Some protesters waved the Catalonia flag, echoing the pro-independence protests in Spain, where protesters clashed with police and Barcelona's Mayor Ada Colau pleaded for calm.On Sunday, water-filled barriers were placed outside West Kowloon station, where few people were spotted as police used loud speakers to ask passers-by to leave the area.China Railway suspended operations of several trains between the mainland and Hong Kong on Sunday. Online posts had indicated that rioters were planning to attack mainland people at the West Kowloon station.Hong Kong police said on Sunday night that they detonated a suspected bomb found at the intersection of Tong Mi Road and Lai Chi Kok Road on Sunday afternoon. The suspect object was a paper box with visible electric wires. The police investigation is ongoing.As unrest in Hong Kong entered the 20th week, rioters continued to target companies with mainland connections. On Sunday, they smashed and vandalized branches of several Chinese mainland banks including Bank of China and China Merchants Bank. They also ""mistakenly"" vandalized a branch of the Hong Kong-based Bank of East Asia near the Mong Kok MTR station.In Mong Kok, black-clad rioters set up barricades and hurled bricks and bottles at the police. Many public facilities including traffic lights and guard rails were destroyed.The Hong Kong police dispersed illegal protesters more quickly by deploying water cannons that sprayed blue water and firing tear gas.Soon-to-be released murder suspect Chan Tong-kai, whose alleged murder of his girlfriend was the reason Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam introduced an extradition bill which turned out to be the fuse of the current chaos in the city, wrote to the city's leader saying he will voluntarily turn himself over to Taiwan police.The HKSAR government said on Sunday that the decision of Chan to surrender himself to Taiwan authorities is purely out of his own free will. The allegations that Chan was manipulated to surrender or his decision was out of political maneuvering are totally groundless, a statement by the HKSAR government said.Chan is due to be released from prison on Wednesday after being convicted a year ago of minor charges including money laundering.Chan could never have imagined that his case would spark months-long protests in Hong Kong, Witman Hung Wai-man, principal liaison officer for Hong Kong at the Shenzhen Qianhai Authority, told the Global Times on Sunday.Taiwan media reports said Taiwan authorities will not allow Chan, and the pastor who persuaded him to surrender, to enter Taiwan.Hung said Chan's surrender will not ease the situation in Hong Kong and the refusal by Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen and her authorities not to allow Chan to enter Taiwan shows their hypocrisy and evil intentions.

"HK murder suspect willing to surrender to Taiwan authoritiesnRioters commit vandalism in Kowloon, Hong Kong on October 6. Photo: Xinhua Still remember whose case triggered the Hong Kong extradition bill row which eventually evolved into a months-long city-wide social turmoil? The suspect said he is willing to surrender to authorities in the Taiwan island.The Chief Executive of Hong Kong received a letter from the suspect Friday saying he decided to surrender himself to Taiwan, and requested the Hong Kong government to assist him in making relevant arrangement.Hong Kong-based Sing Tao Daily reported that Chan Tong-kai, who is serving a 29-month prison term for money laundering, could be released next Wednesday. He said he felt remorse and would like to turn himself in to Taiwan authorities for allegedly murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan.Chan's case prompted the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government to propose an extradition bill, since no formal extradition agreement exists between Hong Kong and Taiwan. Chan was not sent to the island, but only charged for money laundering in Hong Kong.However, opposition to the bill has led to city-wide violent actions, which seriously disrupted social order and jeopardized the rule of law in Hong Kong.Reverend Peter Douglas Koon Ho-ming, provincial secretary general of the Anglican church in Hong Kong, said on Friday that he has visited Chan many times in the past months to convince him to surrender, and Chan has now realized that he has made big mistakes and would like to take responsibility, Sing Tao Daily reported on Friday.Chan said he felt remorseful after learning the bill had sparked social unrest, and he hopes that his surrender could calm the situation. Taiwan lawyers have visited Chan to discuss his case and introduce him to the judicial system and prison conditions of the island, the report said.Lee Kwai-wah, Senior superintendent of the Organized Crime and Triad Bureau of Hong Kong Police Force, said on Friday that Chan could go anywhere after being released, and that there was no reason to lengthen his prison term.Hong Kong lawyer Kennedy Wong Ying-ho told the Global Times on Friday that Chan's possible surrender is a good thing for the victim's family, but it will not ease the current social unrest in Hong Kong, as Hong Kong's current problem has gone far beyond the case.Chan allegedly murdered his then 20-year-old girlfriend Poon Hiu-wing during a trip to the island of Taiwan in February 2018.

They should also strengthen internal training and management to prevent similar mistakes, Yang said.Dior's revenue is expected to grow 18.7 percent this year to $6.96 billion, in part led by the explosive growth in China, media reports said, citing a report by Morgan Stanley.

"China, Nepal upgrade tiesnChinese President Xi Jinping (left) shakes hands with Nepal’s Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli (right) in Kathmandu on Sunday. Nepal rolled out the red carpet on Saturday for China’s president, the first Chinese head of state to visit for 23 years. Photo: AFP Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Sunday during his visit in Nepal that anyone attempting to split China will be crushed and any external force backing such attempts will be deemed by the Chinese people as pipe-dreaming.Xi made the remarks during talks with Nepal's Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli, who said his country firmly supports China in safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity and stands firm in upholding the one-China policy.Nepal, added Oli, will never allow any force to use its territory for separatist activities against China.Dai Yonghong, a professor and academic member of the China Center of South Asia Studies at Sichuan University, told the Global Times on Sunday that such a strong and clear signal sent by the Chinese top leader is a stern warning to not only Tibetan separatists, but also other separatist forces in Xinjiang , Taiwan and Hong Kong.Given Nepal's special geostrategic position between China's Tibet Autonomous Region and India, the US-led West has been lobbying Nepal's certain forces to strengthen cooperation with the West so that the West can use Nepal as a lever in the US Indo-Pacific strategy, noted Dai.The remarks made by leaders of China and Nepal are also a strong warning to the West not to exploit Nepal's geostrategic importance, Dai added.Xi arrived in Kathmandu, capital of Nepal on Saturday afternoon from Chennai after an informal summit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This is the first state visit by a Chinese head of state to Nepal in 23 years.The Chinese president said he appreciated Nepal's firm adherence to the one-China policy, saying that China will as always support Nepal in safeguarding its national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. A big screen broadcasts shots with Chinese elements on the street of Kathmandu, Nepal on October 11. Photo: VCG Lifting ties BRI connection Act as a bridge During a bilateral talk between Xi and President Bidya Devi Bhandari on Saturday, the two leaders agreed to upgrade relations between the two countries to a strategic partnership of cooperation featuring ever-lasting friendship for development and prosperity.Xi called on the two sides to consolidate the political foundation of bilateral ties, and set building of a community with a shared future as a long-term goal for the development of China-Nepal relations, according to the Xinhua News Agency.The two sides should build an all-round cooperation pattern, carry out the construction of a trans-Himalayan connectivity network, and expand exchanges and cooperation in various fields, Xi said.""The new relationship, featuring development and prosperity and dubbed a 'trans-Himalaya' friendship, shows that Nepal has realized that China is a significant partner that could help it realize its development prospects, especially economic development,"" Long Xingchun, a senior research fellow at the Charhar Institute and director of the Center for Indian Studies at China West Normal University, told the Global Times on Sunday.In a joint statement released on Sunday, the two agreed to intensify implementation of the memorandum of understanding on cooperation under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), to enhance connectivity in ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications with the overarching framework of trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network.Recalling a railway cooperation memorandum of understanding signed in June 2018, the two sides agreed to conduct a feasibility study for a China-Nepal Cross Border Railway.As the countries further connect, trade and investment, post-disaster reconstruction, energy and tourism will also be further boosted.In the joint statement, the two vowed to take BRI as an opportunity to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in all fields in a comprehensive manner, respect each other's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and core interests.The two also reiterated a commitment to study the possibility of cooperation for the development of three north-south economic corridors in Nepal - Koshi, Gandaki and Karnali - in order to create jobs, improve local livelihoods and stimulate economic growth and development.The two sides also exchanged and signed on Sunday a list of border management instruments, legal assistance on criminal issues and protection of Mount Qomolangma, known internationally as Mount Everest.China is now Nepal's largest investor and second-largest trade partner. In 2018, trade between China and Nepal reached $1.1 billion, an increase of 11.7 percent year-on-year, according to media reports.Nepal's officials also refuted the so-called debt trap accusation over its participation in BRI.Kundan Aryal, press advisor to Prime Minister Oli, called the debt trap ""propaganda"" in an interview with the Global Times, saying that the ""propaganda is not in place here in Nepal and we are not going to listen to propaganda like that.""Some people were trying to provoke it, while all the parties here have reached a consensus that Nepal wants to benefit from the BRI and people hope that they can benefit from a big economic power, Aryal added.Experts noted China's cooperation with Nepal will contribute to the prosperity and stability of South Asia.""To achieve its development goal, Nepal will need India's resources, but it will also need China. The BRI projects will be a historic development opportunity for Nepal, and the landlocked country could now link to the world through China's help,"" Long said.Long further noted that China's good economic relationship with Nepal will not hamper India's interests in Nepal, as China also supports Nepal to keep a good relationship with India, Long said, adding that India and China can participate in the China-Nepal cooperation as much as possible.In 2018, the leaders of China and India agreed to discuss the possibility of establishing a China-India-Nepal Economic Corridor to boost the development of the three countries.In the context of the improvement of China-India strategic mutual trust, Nepal, neighbor to the two most dynamic economic powers in the world, can completely transform its geopolitical disadvantages into geo-economic advantages, Chinese experts noted.Nepal can not only use the resources of China and India to promote its own economic development, but can act as a bridge between China and India, they said.

"Tsai’s speech malign, ridiculousnIn a speech on Thursday, Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen hyped the mainland's ""diplomatic offensives and military coercion"" and said the mainland is ""threatening to impose"" the ""one country, two systems"" principle on Taiwan. She recounted the ""serious challenges"" Taiwan had faced over the past 70 years, saying that ""we wipe away our tears and stand up once again.""Tsai also mentioned the so-called three goals of the future - ""to defend our sovereignty,"" ""continue to build a stronger Taiwan and bolster our economic capabilities to create a prosperous society and powerful country"" and ""actively engage with the world and overcome challenges, so that the Republic of China (Taiwan) can hold its head high on the international stage with confidence."" Tsai did not forget to brag about her political achievements, but she only said a few words about it because there was nothing much to say.Obviously, Tsai wants to wangle votes by creating panic and intensifying cross-Straits confrontation. She said ""we will not act provocatively or rashly,"" which reflects her trembling heart. In the context of Taiwan's current condition and the cross-Straits situation, Tsai's speech is malign and ridiculous.First, does the island have ""sovereignty?"" Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. This is an ironclad fact recognized by the whole world. Since Tsai took office three years ago, Taiwan has lost seven ""diplomatic allies."" Based on the trend, it may soon lose all. What Tsai referred to as ""sovereignty"" is nonexistent. How can the island defend it?Second, since the Tsai authority always messes things up, how can Taiwan develop its economy? Taiwan's ""ministry of finance"" released Monday the island's export data for September, showing a decline beyond expectations. The unemployment rate in Taiwan remains high and wages have remained stagnant. Since Tsai assumed office, cross-Straits relations have deteriorated drastically, and Taiwan's tourism industry and agricultural exports have suffered a blow. Poor cross-Straits relations will lead to a poor economy in Taiwan. This is common sense.Third, because Tsai refuses to recognize the 1992 Consensus, will there be any space for Taiwan in the international community? Tsai is boasting without shame. Are there any formal international occasions that Taiwan can engage in? The island can only send uninvited representatives. Even netizens in Taiwan pour ridicule on them.Tsai made up to the Western countries in her speech on October 10, 2018, but she said nothing about them on Thursday. Obviously, Tsai intended to raise her status by bonding the island with the US tighter last year. However, after one year, Tsai realized she had gained nothing from such a move and began to be aware of the high risk of being a chess piece of the US. In the past year, Tsai could have clearly seen the fact that she doesn't mean much to Washington.What hasn't changed is Tsai and her Democratic Progressive Party's attitude against reunification. This has pushed the island to the edge of the cliff. We don't know what was in Tsai's mind after she watched the military parade held on National Day in Beijing. What we know is confronted with such power and the strong will of the mainland, the island can easily see the consequences. "	10/10/19	0	0	-0.901	-1
"Chinese netizen uses Butterfly Effect to show how series of unrelated events led to NBA uproarnDaryl Morey. Photo: VCG A Chinese netizen has posted an example of the Butterfly Effect on Sina Weibo, in which a murder in the island of Taiwan has fluttered through time and led to the cancellation of NBA exhibition games in the Chinese mainland.The netizen's hypothesis, explaining a trail of unfortunate and seemingly unrelated events, was the most searched item on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform on Tuesday, with many foreign netizens joining the discussion on platforms such as Twitter and Reddit.It all starts in February 2018 with a man from Hong Kong being accused of murdering his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan and fleeing back to Hong Kong.Then the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region decided in June to amend an extradition bill that would allow it to send the accused murderer back to Taiwan.The amendment would have also established an extradition process for accused criminals wanted in the Chinese mainland. The amendment then triggers a series of protests in Hong Kong that have often led to riots that have resulted in injuries, arrests and great economic losses.Zoom ahead in time to Saturday when Daryl Morey, general manager of Houston Rockets, re-tweeted a message expressing solidarity with the Hong Kong protesters. Although the tweet has been deleted, it was seen as inflammatory and sparked a stormy criticism in the Chinese mainland.Chinese sportswear brand Anita has suspended negotiations with the NBA, saying Chinese basketball fans were dissatisfied with Morey's ""erroneous"" remarks.China Central Television (CCTV) and Chinese live streaming platform Tencent said on Tuesday that they will immediately suspend broadcasts of NBA pre-season games in China.""This is a good example of the Butterfly Effect,"" a Twitter user wrote.

"China, Kiribati formally restore diplomatic tiesn Photo: Xinhua China and Kiribati formally resumed diplomatic relations on Saturday (Beijing time) after the Pacific island state announced its decision to cut ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan last week.Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Kiribati's President Taneti Mamau signed a joint communique at the office of the Permanent Mission of China to the UN in New York on the establishment of diplomatic relations.China and Kiribati agree to develop friendly relations on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence, the communique said.Kiribati government acknowledges one-China principle, and the island of Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. Kiribati government will immediately cut “diplomatic ties” with Taiwan, according to the communique.""Kiribati government undertakes that it shall no longer develop any official relations or official exchanges with Taiwan. China appreciates the position of Kiribati government,"" the communique said.Kiribati, located in the Central Pacific Ocean, announced its decision to cut “diplomatic ties” with the island of Taiwan on September 20, less than one week after the Solomon Islands cut its “diplomatic relations” with Taiwan.The Solomon Islands formally established ties with China on September 21 in Beijing.Analysts said it will be an irreversible trend that more countries will sever “diplomatic ties” with Taiwan and acknowledge the one-China principle. There are possibilities that some other countries will establish diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China in the near future.On Wednesday, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Kiribati's President Taneti Mamau at the 74th session of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly.During their meeting, Wang said China highly appreciated Kiribati's statement last week, which acknowledged the one-China principle and declared its severance of the so-called ""diplomatic ties"" with the Taiwan authorities and restoration of diplomatic relations with China, Xinhua reported.Mamau, also Kiribati's foreign minister, said at the meeting that the government's decision to ""break off diplomatic relations"" with Taiwan and re-establish diplomatic relations with China is its own choice based on the interests of Kiribati and its people, read the same Xinhua report.He also said Kiribati is increasingly aware that the brotherhood and friendship with China is important for Kiribati's national development.Kiribati originally established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1980, but the relationship was disrupted after it formed ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan in 2003.

"China condemns US congressional approval of Hong Kong billnProtesters set fire on the main road of Causeway Bay on August 31. Photo: Wang Wenwen/GT Foreign interference The consecutive moves on Wednesday by US congressional committees to approve Hong Kong and Taiwan acts are blatant interference in China's domestic affairs and should be viewed against the backdrop of overall China-US confrontation, Chinese analysts warned on Thursday.Both House and Senate committees approved the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, paving the way for the bill to become law amid months of social unrest in the Chinese city.The bill, if passed, would sanction Chinese officials found ""suppressing Hong Kong's democracy, human rights or citizen freedoms"" by freezing their assets in the US and denying them entry to the US.Also on Wednesday, the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations passed the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative Act, or TAIPEI Act, which, if passed, would require the US State Department to induce governments that have diplomatic ties with Taiwan to maintain the ties and support Taiwan in joining international organizations.The US move came after the Solomon Islands and Kiribati cut their ties with Taiwan. The Solomon Islands established diplomatic relations with China on September 21.China's Foreign Ministry Wednesday expressed anger and firm opposition to the US approval of the Hong Kong bill.Geng Shuang, spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, noted that the protests sweeping across Hong Kong, once triggered by an extradition bill, have changed in essence.Incited by external force and Hong Kong's secessionist forces, radical groups and rioters have wantonly damaged public facilities and attacked the police, and have gone far beyond what is allowed in normal demonstrations and protests, Geng said.The US houses have turned a blind eye to such maleficence and lent a helping hand to these radical forces and rioters, Geng said, which exposed ""the evil purpose of certain US politicians to destabilize Hong Kong and contain China's development.""Geng also slammed passage of the TAIPEI act on Thursday, which he said was a serious breach of the one-China principle, the three China-US joint communiqués and basic norms governing international relations, and interferes in China's internal affairs.The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council on Thursday strongly condemned and firmly opposed the approval of the Hong Kong-related bill. The bill was blatant interference in China's internal affairs and a trampling of international law and the principles of international relations, the office said.""We urge the US Congress and certain politicians to stop their meddling in matters that will hurt China-US ties,"" a spokesperson was quoted as saying on the office's website.Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, told the Global Times the US has been engaged in Taiwan affairs for years, and the chaos in Hong Kong is providing the US with new leverage to pressure China.Besides the two bills on Hong Kong and Taiwan, another bill, the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, which appeals for the Trump administration to consider sanctions against Chinese officials over so-called ""internment camps,"" was passed by the US Senate on September 11. A Beijing law expert told the Global Times on condition of anonymity that by passing different bills that all relate to China, the US is playing the China card in multiple dimensions.""All these bills should be viewed against the backdrop of the overall China-US confrontation and the trade war,"" the expert said.Experts noted that over the past three months, Hong Kong protesters have relentlessly resorted to foreign support.Some protesters waved the national flags of the US, the UK and even Germany as a means to appeal to Western countries for help.During a protest on September 8, some called for US support outside the US Consulate General in Hong Kong, waving US flags and shouting slogans in English.In early August, Hong Kong activists Joshua Wong and Nathan Law met Julie Eadeh, a political unit chief of the US consulate in a Hong Kong hotel lobby. Wong claimed their discussion focused on the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.Last week US politicians including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Jim McGovern met Wong and Denise Ho, a singer-actress activist, and invited them to testify at a Hong Kong-related hearing.Witman Hung Wai-man, principal liaison officer for Hong Kong at the Shenzhen Qianhai Authority, called the activists' move to drum up US support ""absurd.""""International politics is all about interests. By offering such 'support,' the US does not take Hong Kong people's interests into consideration,"" Hung said.""Meanwhile, begging for such intervention from the US will only set Hong Kong people in peril.""Xin Qiang from Fudan University noted that a dangerous sign was that Taiwan and Hong Kong secessionists were colluding, each with US backing.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and the Hong Kong government have undertaken a slew of measures to cool the social unrest that has engulfed the city since June.They include relief measures totaling more than HK$19 billion ($2.4 billion), with policies targeting small and medium-sized enterprises, students and low-income families.

"Kiribati becomes the second country in a week to sever ties with TaiwannThe President of Kiribati Taneti Mamau. Photo: VCG RELATED ARTICLES: China praises Solomon Islands for cutting ties with Taiwan island Kiribati is the second country to break ties with the island of Taiwan in less than a week, with observers predicting that more nations from the Pacific would cut ties before October, and accelerate the building of diplomatic ties with the Chinese mainland.The remarks were made after Kiribati officially notified Taiwan on Friday that it was cutting ""diplomatic ties,"" Joseph Wu, ""foreign minister"" of Taiwan, told reporters at a hastily organized press conference.Geng Shuang, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told Friday's regular media conference that China supports the important decision made by Kiribati as a sovereign independent state after the country cut ""diplomatic ties"" with the island of Taiwan and resumed diplomatic relations with Chinese mainland.Kiribati will see many development opportunities through cooperation with the Chinese mainland, Geng said. He stressed that principles and trust cannot be bought, dismissing rumors that the Chinese mainland used money to convince Kiribati to break ties with the island of Taiwan.The Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council also highly commended Kiribati government's decision.Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson of the office, said the unreasonable accusations of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) against the Kiribati government are inconsistent with what they had said about Kiribati in the past, and they are extremely disrespectful to the country and its people.Experts predicted that more countries which have ""diplomatic ties"" with the island of Taiwan are likely to join Kiribati and Solomon Islands in the near future.It is an irreversible trend that more countries will accelerate the pace of establishing ties with the Chinese mainland, which is likely to usher in a small wave of establishing diplomatic ties in the coming weeks, Yin Cunyi, a professor at the School of Public Policy and Management and executive associate dean at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of Tsinghua University in Beijing, told the Global Times on Friday.Located in the Central Pacific Ocean, Kiribati is about 4,000 kilometers southwest of Hawaii and consists of 33 coral islands. The Chinese mainland closed its space-tracking station in Kiribati after the country recognized Taiwan in 2003.The ripple effect of breaking ties with Taiwan will surely continue, and Kiribati won't be the last one, Yang Lixian, a research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center of Cross-Straits Relations, told the Global Times.Yang noted that with limited resources and power, the island of Taiwan can only offer petty favors for its allies, which are incomparable with what these countries can benefit under cooperation with the Chinese mainland which advocates mutually beneficial and equal cooperation.While they are facing pressure from some Western countries, many people in the Pacific countries, including Palau and Nauru, have shown willingness to seek cooperation with the Chinese mainland and sever ties with Taiwan, Yu Lei, chief research fellow at the research center for Pacific island countries of Liaocheng University in East China's Shandong Province, told the Global Times on Friday.Haiti was planning to cut ties, Wang Hau-yu, a ""councilor"" of Taoyuan city in Taiwan, said on Facebook earlier this month.Enele Sopoaga, former prime minister of Tuvalu, a strong supporter of the island of Taiwan, stepped down after a general election on Thursday. The act was deemed as a blow for its ""ally,"" the island of Taiwan.Yin said the possibility of other South Pacific or Caribbean countries cutting ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan before October 1 should not be dismissed.Taiwan has only 15 remaining ""diplomatic allies.""Kiribati is the seventh country to cut ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan since Tsai Ing-wen took office in 2016, following Sao Tome and Principe, Panama, Burkina Faso, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and the Solomon Islands.Taiwan's ""diplomatic"" unrest should provoke Tsai to consider that by sabotaging cross-Straits relations, the island's situation will only deteriorate, Yang noted.After the Solomon Islands cut relations, Tsai accused the Chinese mainland of using ""financial and political pressure.""Taiwan authorities hyped the groundless accusation that the Chinese mainland used a Boeing 737 to demand that Kiribati cut ""diplomatic ties.""Tsai said on Friday afternoon that it is ""a big mistake"" for Kiribati to give up on Taiwan.The usual practice of the DPP is to weave lies to divert attention and deceive the vast number of Taiwan compatriots. They have done this in the past and will continue to do so, said Ma.People on both sides of the Taiwan Straits see it clearly. Only by upholding the one-China principle can cross-Straits relations be improved and developed, said Ma, noting that Taiwan compatriots can obtain a better livelihood and welfare, greater development space, and more security and dignity.""Some people in the island of Taiwan used this line to confuse right and wrong,"" Geng said on Friday.Yu told the Global Times some Western countries offer Kiribati more aid than the Chinese mainland does. ""The decision to cut ties, which will surely infuriate its biggest aiders, is unlikely made because of 'China's aid,'"" Yu said.Countries in the Pacific, including Kiribati, are eyeing equal and beneficial cooperation with the Chinese mainland, as they see how other countries have benefited from their cooperation with the mainland, especially under the Belt and Road initiative (BRI), he added.The BRI will not only help connect island countries in the region, but could also expand the region's cooperation with Asian countries, Yu said.

"Taiwan should learn from island nations’ snubnTaipei skyline Photo: VCG Solomon Islands and Kiribati severed ""diplomatic ties"" with the island of Taiwan within one week and decided to adhere to the one-China principle ever after. This has tremendously impacted Taiwan. The island has lost seven ""diplomatic allies"" since Tsai Ing-wen took office. It is high time for Taiwan authorities to seriously reflect on their cross-Straits policies and to recognize and accept the reality of international and cross-Straits relations.First, the one-China principle can never be shaken. The number of ""diplomatic allies"" of Taiwan has decreased to 15 by now. Additionally, Taiwan has been excluded from multilateral events such as the World Health Assembly and the General Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization over the past three years. Although Taiwan authorities are seeking to realize their ambition of ""joining the UN,"" it is well known that this is an impossible task.Second, Taiwan gets no more chance or space to exercise ""dollar diplomacy."" Taiwan has tried to maintain its ""diplomatic allies"" circle by ""dollar diplomacy.""Before the announced break-up of ""diplomatic relations"" between Solomon Islands and Taiwan, it was reported that Taiwan has pledged a fund to help the Solomon Islands. ""Dollar diplomacy"" is against international trend and the interests of the concerned parties.With the rise of the mainland, China's international influence is expanding by the day and no countries or regions can afford not developing relations with the mainland.The island of Taiwan is of little use politically and economically to Solomon Islands; yet on the contrary, Beijing can play a key role in safeguarding Solomon Islands' interests under multilateral mechanisms such as the UN, the Group of 77 and China, etc. In addition, Solomon Islands can also share the dividends of China's rise and development. The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the China-South Pacific Forum have helped augment national interest of the countries concerned. The Taiwan island is unable to do so.Third, support that the US and other Western countries offered to the island of Taiwan does not work. At present, the Tsai authorities take advantage of the strategic competition between China and the US in an attempt to use US support to keep its ""diplomatic allies.""Despite US pressure, the Solomon Islands still made the right decision in keeping with its own national interests to sever ""diplomatic relations"" with Taiwan. It demonstrates that the so-called US support for Taiwan does not work. In recent years, with a relative decline in US strength and status, especially after Trump promoted the ""America First"" policy, the strategic influence and credibility of the US have been severely damaged.Finally, to improve cross-Straits relations is Taiwan's only choice. During the eight years of Kuomintang leader Ma Ying-jeou's rule, Taiwan only lost one ""diplomatic ally.""The fundamental reason is that Ma recognizes the 1992 Consensus, putting a priority on cross-Straits relations, and there had been basic mutual trust across the Straits then.For the moment, it seems that the Tsai authorities have not learned any lesson from it, still sticking to ""Taiwan independence"" and ""dollar diplomacy."" However, against the increasingly obvious comparison in strength between China and the US and between Taiwan and the mainland, there might be a day when Taiwan loses all its ""diplomatic allies"" if it refuses to change.The author is an associate research fellow of the Institute of Taiwan Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	9/25/19	0	0	0.9829	1

"China launches first amphibious assault shipnChina holds a launch ceremony for its first Type 075 amphibious assault ship in Shanghai on Wednesday. Photo: 81.cn A launch ceremony was held for China's first amphibious assault ship, the Type 075, on Wednesday in a move that represents a new era for China's warship development, Chinese military experts said.Said to be a small aircraft carrier by its appearance, an amphibious assault ship usually features a straight flight deck capable of hosting helicopters, vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft and short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft, as well as cabins that can hold amphibious tanks, armored vehicles and air-cushioned landing craft (LCAC).The launch ceremony was held on Wednesday morning in Shanghai, the Xinhua News Agency reported.The warship will see further equipment adjustments and sea trials before its commissioning, according to the Xinhua report.""The Type 075 will become an indispensable and fresh force in China's modern naval warfare, especially for landing missions,"" an anonymous military expert told the Global Times.An amphibious assault ship is the second complex warship built by China, after its aircraft carrier. The immense design, construction and cost allow only a few countries including France and Japan to develop such a warship, the expert said.Only China and the US are capable of making ships as powerful as the Type 075, the expert said.The Type 075 has an estimated displacement of 40,000 tons, a length of 250 meters, a width of 30 meters, a draft of 8.5 meters, and a speed of 23 knots, US-based media outlet the National Interest reported in May. This makes the Chinese ship comparable to the US' Wasp-class amphibious assault ship.The launch of the Type 075 represents a new era for China's warship development, the expert said.Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military analyst, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the launch of the amphibious assault ship fills in a blank in China's large warships development.Unlike amphibious landing docks like the Type 071 which China already operates, the Type 075 can carry many more helicopters, allowing it to launch land assaults from much greater distances from shore and provide greater supporting firepower from the air, Wei said.It also enables the Chinese military to more efficiently deploy troops from farther distances thanks to its large hangers, Wei said.Many analysts see the Type 075 as a vital tool if the Chinese mainland ever had to reunify the island of Taiwan by force.If Taiwan secessionists cross the red line, the Type 075 could serve as a stern warning to them and foreign opposition forces, an anonymous expert said.Chinese military enthusiasts were also amazed by the speed of construction of the Type 075. After its superstructure was completed, its communication and electric systems, including radars and painting, were completed in just a few weeks.The launch of the Type 075 not only is a gift to the People's Republic of China's 70th founding anniversary, but also shows that China will resolutely carry out its international obligations, safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and maintain peace in the region and around the world, the expert said.

"Solomon Islands and China forge official diplomatic ties, opening a new chapter for Pacific Island countrynAfter severing ties with China's island of Taiwan earlier this week, Solomon Islands established formally diplomatic relations with the Chinese mainland in Beijing on Saturday, a decision that acknowledges the unequivocal one-China principleThe country, among 14 pacific countries with a total population of about 627,000, announced to cut the ""diplomatic ties"" with the island of Taiwan on Monday, a decision to acknowledge the one-China principle.Chinese Sate Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Solomon Islands Foreign Minister Jeremiah Manele signed a joint communiqué during the ceremony of the formal establishment of bilateral relations the two nations that marked the formal establishment of diplomatic ties.""Solomon Islands acknowledges one-China principle, and the island of Taiwan is an inseparable part of China; China highly praises the stance of Solomon Islands,"" Wang said, noting that the history will tell the fundamental and long-term interests of this decision to the people of the Solomon Islands.""China won't seek unilateral interest, and our cooperation with Solomon Island will be equal, open, reciprocal,"" the Chinese Foreign Minister added.Manele noted during the ceremony that the decision of establishing formal diplomatic relations with China is based on the country's national interests, and Solomon Islands needs a broad partnership. ""And now we are ready to begin a new era of relations with China,"" he said.Taiwan, under international law, is not entitled to diplomatic relations with any sovereign country in the world because it is not recognized as a country by the United Nations, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said in a statement on Friday. ""Our sovereign decision to sever diplomatic relations is therefore consistent with international law,"" he added. Photo: Li Hao/GT Amid resounding praises from China, the Solomon Islands' decision was followed by Kiribati, another pacific island, which broke ties with the island of Taiwan on Friday. According to analysts this will accelerate the pace of more countries establishing diplomatic ties with the mainland and acknowledging one-China principle is an irreversible trend in the global community.""Establishing diplomatic ties with the mainland will also stimulate those in the Pacific that still maintain 'diplomatic relations' with Taiwan island, which may lead to a 'domino effect' among them,"" Xie Bohua, former Chinese ambassador to Vanuatu, told the Global Times on Saturday.Two countries severing ties with the island of Taiwan in a week is also seen as ""a major blow"" to Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen's office, as many observers and politicians have been questioning Tsai's policies and her competency to maintain a healthy cross-strait relation as well as maintaining the stability of Taiwan's external affairs.Since Tsai took the office in 2016, growing number of countries including severed ties with Taiwan, setting a new record as the regional leader who saw the highest number of countries ending ""diplomatic relations"" with the island. Photo: Li Hao/GT Sogavare said in the statement that over past years, Solomon Islands would encourage more business from Taiwan to invest in the country, however, they have not been actively doing so, and their investments have been in political interests.Meanwhile, the Solomon Islands cutting ties with Taiwan also reflects its long-term development interests rather than being uncertain over what might happen after reunification of Taiwan with mainland one day, the prime minister said.""People in Taiwan would raise more doubts on the Tsai's office, as her policies to confront the mainland with the help of the US could not stop countries from forging ties with the mainland,"" Jin Yi, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Saturday.The way of confronting the mainland, from political to economic to cultural, will all end in vain, and people will be aware of this trend, he noted.Since Tsai assumed office in 2016, the number of countries severing ties with the island of Taiwan has been growing at large.Sogavare said in the statement that over the past many years theSolomon Islands has encouraged more business from Taiwan to invest in the country; however, they have not been actively doing so, and their investments have been in political interests.Meanwhile, the Solomon Islands cutting ties with Taiwan also reflects its long-term development goals rather than reeling in uncertainty about the possible overcomes after the reunification of the island of Taiwan with the mainland, the prime minister noted.""People in the island of Taiwan would raise more doubts on Tsai's office, as her policies to confront the mainland with the help of the US could not stop countries from forging ties with the mainland,"" Jin Yi, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Saturday.The mannerism of confronting the mainland, from political to economic to cultural, will all end in vain, and people will be aware of this trend, he noted.After formally establishing diplomatic ties, the Solomon Islands and China will see closer political and economic cooperation, which will also benefit the regional development of the entire Pacific Island,officials and observers said.Even prior to the establishment of official diplomatic relations, China was the largest export destination for the Solomon Islands with 65.2 percent of the country's merchandise exported to China in 2017, according to the official statistics. Now, deepened ties will offer greater business and growth opportunities to the Pacific Island country, which will help create more development synergies in the region.In 2018, China-Solomon Island reached a total volume of 2 billion Solomon Island dollars ($242 million), with China being the largest single trading partner surpassing other partners of the Soloman Islands in total trade volume.

"Taiwan is to blame for Kiribati’s decisionnThe President of Kiribati Taneti Mamau. Photo: VCG The Pacific island nation of Kiribati on Friday abruptly severed ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan. It came less than a week after the Solomon Islands cut ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan. Taiwan's ""diplomacy"" is collapsing, and may lose all of its ""allies."" Kiribati established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1980, but the Taiwan authority bought over its ""diplomatic ties"" in 2003. At that time, Taiwan's GDP was about one-fifth of the mainland's, and Taiwan could adopt ""money diplomacy."" But after more than 10 years, Taiwan's GDP is less than one-twentieth of the mainland's. Such ""money diplomacy"" has collapsed in Taiwan. The Taiwan authority declared that the mainland used money to buy over Pacific nations. But these nations required no financial assistance when they switched to the mainland. Because of short-term economic interests, these nations used to maintain ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan. They are now propelled by strategic interests to establish ties with the mainland. After all, a country will seem strange if it has no diplomatic relations with the mainland. In the globalization era, Taiwan's financial assistance has become less attractive to the smaller nations as the Chinese mainland-proposed Belt and Road Initiative expands coverage. Smaller nations need sustainable development conditions rather than temporary alms from a region which is politically suspicious in itself. The more ""allies"" Taiwan loses, the smaller space there will be for Taiwan in the international community to pretend as a ""country."" This is a warning to Taiwan that ""Taiwan independence"" leads nowhere. The Taiwan authority hopes that the US can stop these ""allies"" from cutting off ties with it. Washington did threaten these nations and demanded that they maintain the status quo with Taiwan. The US threats could exert some pressure, but failed to work for the Solomon Islands and Kiribati. All countries would evaluate multiple factors in their consideration of diplomacy, and their national interest is the starting point of such an evaluation. Is it more important to develop normal relations with a permanent member of the UN Security Council which has a population of 1.4 billion, or is it wiser to maintain ""diplomatic relations"" with a region of 20 million people not recognized as a country by the international community? Isn't the answer obvious? The Taiwan authority accused the Solomon Islands and Kiribati of falling into the mainland's ""money trap."" Taiwan authorities are humiliating themselves as this shows money-relations are the only thing they know. The Taiwan authority also declared that every time Taiwan loses an ""ally,"" it is the result of the mainland trying to interfere in Taiwan's regional leadership elections. In fact, all that the Tsai Ing-wen authority considers is the 2020 Taiwan elections. A re-election is Tsai's priority. Tsai would welcome a situation of Taiwan losing all its ""allies"" as long as it benefits the Democratic Progressive Party's re-election. The mainland will maintain long-term development and further strengthen its power. The result of the Taiwan elections is uncontrollable, but the mainland is firmly in control of the consequences and influence of Taiwan elections. "	9/20/19	0	0	-0.9615	-1

"China ‘highly appreciates’ Solomon Islands’ cutting Taiwan tiesnSolomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare. File photo: VCG China on Monday said it highly appreciates the Solomon Islands' decision to cut the ""diplomatic ties"" with the island of Taiwan and acknowledge the one-China principle.""We support the important decision made by the Solomon Islands as an independent sovereign country,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a statement released at the website of the ministry Monday night.The decision to acknowledge the one-China principle and establish diplomatic ties with China once again proved that the principle corresponds with the will of the people and the irresistible trend of the times, said Hua.China would like to make efforts with the Solomon Islands to explore a broader future of the development of relations between the two countries, said Hua.The Solomon Islands congress will break ""diplomatic ties"" with the island of Taiwan and switch to Beijing, Taipei-based news agency CNA reported on Monday.Taiwan's ""Foreign Minister"" Joseph Wu said in Taipei late Monday that it would immediately close down its ""embassy"" and recall all its diplomats, Reuters reported on Monday.The switch takes Taiwan's ""diplomatic allies"" down to 16.Taiwan is suffering strong diplomatic unrest under the Tsai Ing-wen authority, losing five ""diplomatic allies"" since Tsai was elected leader of the island in 2016.Chinese mainland observers of Taiwan affairs and Pacific politics noted that the move was in line with a general trend that the international community recognizes the one-China principle.Rumors of the Solomon Islands' shift from Taiwan to the Chinese mainland have spread for months.The Solomon Islands' break from Taiwan is a heavy blow to secessionists, especially leader Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election in January with her Democratic Progressive Party, Yang Lixian, a research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center of Cross-Straits Relations, told the Global Times on Monday.Li Fei, a professor at the Taiwan Research Institute of Xiamen University in East China's Fujian Province, told the Global Times that if the Chinese mainland agrees to build diplomatic ties with the Solomon Islands, it will be seen as a move to punish the Tsai authority for its close involvement in the Hong Kong unrest.Secessionists in Taiwan and Hong Kong should understand their attempts to split China go against the general trend and are ""doomed to fail,"" Li said.More countries in the South Pacific may join the Solomon Islands in cutting ties with Taiwan.""Considering the strong influence of the US in the Caribbean Sea, it may take some time for Taiwan's remaining 'diplomatic allies' to sever ties with Taiwan,"" Li said.""Haiti may be next,"" said Li.Haiti was planning to cut ties, Wang Hau-yu, a ""councilor"" of Taoyuan city in Taiwan, posted on Facebook.

(Photo: Xinhua) Building ties with the Chinese mainland favors the general public on the Solomon Islands, said Yu Lei, a chief research fellow at the research center for Pacific island countries of Liaocheng University in East China's Shandong Province.The Solomon Islands is a country with a small territorial area and population, Yu said, and its economic development depends heavily on foreign aid.""In recent years, the country has developed good economic and trade ties with the Chinese mainland,"" he said.Countries like the US, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France and the UK still try to influence island countries, he noted.They force countries to buck ties with the Chinese mainland by means such as threatening to cut aid altogether, economic sanctions, supporting anti-government forces or using local NGOs to pressure governments.The Solomon Islands' move shows that countries with ""diplomatic ties"" with the island of Taiwan have a ""general feeling of insecurity,"" Lü Cuncheng, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times.The international community recognizes the one-China principle and worries about the rampant tendency of ""Taiwan independence,"" Lü said.It was the general trend to develop friendly relations with the Chinese mainland, he believed.""The island of Taiwan worries about the situation and will step up to maintain ties, but they cannot change the general trend,"" Lü said. ""Countries will build relations based on their own national interests.""There might not be much more cutting of relations with Taiwan approaching the 2020 Taiwan election s, Lü predicted.""But for sure countries with 'diplomatic ties' with the island will be fewer and fewer,"" he said.There is no specific data about the number of ethnic Chinese or Chinese nationals on the Solomon Islands. But a database from the China Center for Economic Research indicated thousands of Chinese people living there.Li Lin, an employee at a mining company on the Solomon Islands, told the Global Times that many Chinese reside there. She said at least 70 percent of shops in the capital Honiara are run by Chinese.Most Chinese were looking forward to diplomatic ties, Li said.""People here have been gossiping about the news recently. Local newspapers are also reporting it,"" Li said.""We of course hope the Chinese mainland could build diplomatic ties with the Solomon Islands as soon as possible.""Li complained there was ""no embassy"" for Chinese on the islands.""The embassy is the backbone of Chinese people abroad.

"Solomon Islands could be the next investment hub with stronger Chinese tiesnMa Xiaoguang, spokesperson of Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council The Solomon Islands' decision to cut diplomatic ties with the island of Taiwan and acknowledge the one-China principle may attract more Chinese mainland investment and help the local economy, experts say. As an economically underdeveloped country, the Solomon Islands has a lot to offer for Chinese investors, particularly in areas where China has a technological advantage, Zhao Shaofeng, an associate professor from the Pacific Islands Research Center at China's Liaocheng University, told the Global Times. The Solomon Islands is an agricultural country, with agriculture, forestry and fisheries being its main economic pillars. It mainly exports wood, fish, and products such as cocoa and coconut. Most daily necessities, home appliances, rice, industrial manufactured goods and petroleum are imported, Zhao said. Locals largely rely on working in Australia and New Zealand for income, or working in local restaurants and businesses. The average monthly salary on the Solomon Islands is 2,000 to 3,000 yuan ($281 to $422), according to Zhao. The Solomon Islands' tourism and hospitality industry is a potential economic growth sector that will change significantly as diplomatic relations with the Chinese mainland are established, Zhao said, adding that local wood production and processing, fishery resources and infrastructure construction will have great potential for development as well. ""The local power supply relies mainly on oil development, and the island country pays great attention to sustainable development. China has mature solar technology, which will have a lot of room for development in the Solomon Islands."" According to Zhao, the Solomon Islands could be a land of opportunity for Chinese investors, as long as investors respect local culture and abide by local laws and regulations. The Solomon Islands is a suitable destination for engineering companies in China that are capable of undertaking international construction projects, Zhao said. ""They can improve local infrastructure. Of course, some companies that are capable of growing crops (vegetables), fishing and breeding companies and so on can also go to invest there"" Investors from the Chinese mainland will need to take into account the local customs. ""Some investors like to buy land in island countries, and it is important to confirm whether or not the land has disputes, such as if it is publically owned land or private land. For large-scale investment, investors must do a good job in preliminary research and investigation. Due to political instability in the Solomon Islands, it is possible the investments may fail,"" Zhao said. "	9/19/19	0	0	0.9888	1
"Taiwan throws tantrum over Solomon Islands' severance of 'diplomatic ties'n○ The Taiwan authority exaggerated its previous assistance to the Solomon Islands while the latter announced it was cutting ties with Taiwan○ Instead of raising pigs and bees, what the Solomon Islands really needs is help with modernization, which Taiwan cannot offer In this file photo taken on September 09, 2019, Taiwan's ""Foreign Minister"" Joseph Wu (right) takes part in a press conference with Solomon Islands' Foreign Minister Jeremiah Manele (left) in Taipei. Photo: AFP Mite on an elephant The Solomon Islands decided to sever ties with Taiwan on Monday, and the Taiwan authority repeated its condemnation of the Chinese mainland for allegedly ""suppressing"" Taiwan.Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen claimed that no price could be put on what Taiwan has done for the Solomon people, especially in the medical, agricultural, educational and cultural fields. But what has Taiwan done for Solomon Islanders over the past 36 years as ""diplomatic allies,"" especially after Tsai was elected in 2016? There were seven public ""business trips"" by the administrative departments of Taiwan since Tsai took office, according to report.nat.gov.tw, a website that publishes reports of official business trips in Taiwan.According to an introduction from report.nat.gov.tw, the ""Executive Yuan"" and its affiliated institutions, schools, public organizations and individuals who travel for study, inspections and other activities at public expense have to submit reports within three months of coming back to Taiwan in accordance with relevant regulations.However, as evident in the seven travel reports, things were not implemented according to the introduction.For example, one of the reports is about ""A trip to the Solomon Islands for the 6th Melanesian Arts and Cultural Festival and Independence Day."" A 13-member song and dance troupe, which was led by Tseng Chih-yung from the ""Council of Indigenous Peoples,"" went to the Solomon Islands from July 4 to July 13, 2018.Most of their daily arrangements were vaguely described as ""attending the Melanesian Arts and Cultural Festival."" During their eight-day stay in the Solomon Islands, the troupe performed 12 songs, which could be defined as a low-intensity cultural exchange.However, the report exaggerated the event, stating that ""the professional performance stunned countries in the Melanesian area… The content of the performance, the clothing, the high quality of the performers, as well as the scale of our performances represented the 'national' high level of the troupe… The performance would launch a new era for Taiwan to develop cultural exchanges in the area and strengthen mutual understanding and friendship.""""From this trip, we can see the good development of Taiwan's policies toward the South, which will also help Taiwan enter into a new stage in international exchanges,"" read the report.A year after the report's release, the important ""diplomatic friend"" announced the severance of ties with Taiwan.The Taiwan authority and the residents reacted in contrasting ways following the Solomon Islands decision to sever ties. Many residents in Taiwan reached by the Global Times do not think it will affect their lives, citing how far away the Solomon Islands is. The Taiwan authority, on the other hand, is anything but calm.New Party spokesman Wang Ping-chung, who is also a commentator, told the Global Times that ""It needs to further study the materials to know the expense of an official business trip.

The largest investments from Taiwan to the Solomon Islands were made when Ma Ying-jeou was the Taiwan leader, which aimed to help with the island country's agricultural and economic development.After Ma's promotional work, what did Tsai bring to the Solomon Islands apart from glitzy ""exchange activities?""This Global Times reporter found that four technical teams, sent by the island of Taiwan to the Solomon Islands, were mentioned in the 2018 annual report of international cooperation and development affairs under Taiwan's ""Foreign Ministry."" The teams were sent in line with plans in the fields of pig-raising, beekeeping, and improving fruit, vegetables and crops. These plans were also included in the reports of 2016 and 2017.The island of Taiwan's overseas assistance is mainly carried out by Taiwan's ""International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF)."" Based in Taipei, ICDF has 108 employees on the island of Taiwan and 142 professionals overseas carrying out development and cooperation work, according to its 2018 annual report.The ICDF website said the overseas assistance plans were launched before Tsai came to power.

"Outrage forces BNP Paribas to alter HK, Taiwan labelsnBNP Paribas branch in Shanghai.

But it continues to list Hong Kong and Taiwan alongside China on its English-language website.Just one day before the incident, Chinese social media was filled with demands for the firm to dismiss one of its Hong Kong-based employees for supporting Hong Kong riot s and secessionism, after netizens found a person named Jason Y. Ng, reportedly a BNP Paribas employee, who had made secessionist posts on his Facebook account.BNP Paribas did not respond to the case on Tuesday, although it apologized in a Friday statement in a social media post for one of its unidentified employees.Ng called residents who waved China's national flags and sang the Chinese national anthem at the IFC Mall in Hong Kong ""monkeys"" in one Facebook post that has since been deleted, and showed photos of him with Joshua Wong Chi-fung, a Hong Kong separatist and activist of the illegal ""Occupy Central"" movement in 2014, eating together in another post.The continued scandals have put BNP Paribas's China business in danger, as Chinese netizens have been urging Chinese companies to cease cooperation with the firm and demanding it to be put on China's unreliable entity list.BNP Paribas is the latest global firm to face a backlash from Chinese netizens for its Hong Kong stance, following London-based banking giant HSBC, Amazon and the ""Big Four"" accounting firms.

"China praises Solomon Islands for cutting ties with Taiwan islandnMa Xiaoguang, spokesperson of Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council The Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council praised Solomon Islands on Tuesday after the country ended ""diplomatic ties"" with the island of Taiwan on Monday, saying that the decision will benefit the country's people and the one-China principle in an overwhelming global trend of recognition.There is only one China in the world, to which the island of Taiwan is an inalienable part. That is a basic fact and the general consensus of the international community, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson of the office, said on Tuesday.Ma also slammed Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)'s accusations of ""dollar diplomacy"" and ""political suppression"" as a complete self-deception which only aims to divert attention.The DPP's attempts to sow discord between China and the rest of the world are doomed to fail and China will never rescind the one-China principle, and this is clear to anyone with an international perspective and common sense, Ma stressed.Ma noted that the DPP is responsible for the current situation, as it has undermined the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations and the common political ground established by the ""1992 Consensus.""The 1992 Consensus is the only choice to safeguard the interests and well-being of compatriots in Taiwan and the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, Ma added.Global Times "	9/17/19	0	0	0.8885	1

"Abandoning Taiwan reflects a trendnSolomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare. Photo: IC RELATED ARTICLES: Solomons cuts Taiwan ties The Solomon Islands has cut its ""diplomatic relations"" with the island of Taiwan and switched to Beijing. This is the sixth country Taiwan has lost as a ""diplomatic ally"" since Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen took office. There are only 16 ""allies"" left for Taiwan.The island of Taiwan is not a country. No major powers in the world recognize that it has sovereign status. A few small states as its ""diplomatic allies"" have also abandoned it.The Tsai authority soon accused the Chinese mainland of engaging in ""dollar diplomacy."" It was extremely ridiculous. It is the Taiwan authority that has relied on money to maintain improper foreign relations. They have not yet figured out the world's general trend, believing that money can settle everything.It is worth noting that the US Congress and the Trump administration in 2018 repeatedly warned that countries breaking ""diplomatic relations"" with Taiwan may lose Washington's assistance and even face US sanctions. Solomon's move fully demonstrates the limitations of US pressure.It is a general trend that Taiwan will continue to lose its existing ""diplomatic allies"" and may even have no ally at all. US support cannot change such a trend. The reason is quite simple: China has been playing a significant role in all aspects of the global economy and politics. There is no reason for any normal country to stand opposite China.There have been ""diplomatic battles"" across the Taiwan Straits. Taiwan authorities poached a few of Beijing's diplomatic allies through its ""silver bullet"" diplomacy.But such cases have gradually disappeared. Most small nations' moves to abandon Taiwan are no longer a bid to maximize aid. Establishing diplomatic relations has become their long-term strategic choice.""Taiwan independence"" has already been a political label of self-deception. It is no longer a so-called political belief. Most Taiwan independence forces have become political opportunists. What they are concerned most about is how to use cross-Straits confrontations to seek their own political interests.The Solomon Islands is a South Pacific nation. Its shift from the island of Taiwan to Beijing will not only irritate some Americans, but also unnerve some political forces in Australia. They will interpret the change as ""an expansion of China's sphere of influence,"" refusing to recognize such natural consequences of China's rise. China has already become the second-largest economy of the world, but they hope to treat the country the way they did three or four decades ago.Both the US and Australia have diplomatic relations with China. Elites in the two countries have no reason to expect small countries like the Solomon Islands to continue having relations with Taiwan. Those small countries should be more cautious and obey the rules. They need to follow the trend in the changing world.Taiwan has reportedly pledged a fund to help the Solomon Islands, but it turned out to be in vain. The Solomon Islands' severing ties with Taiwan will definitely increase the pressure and cost for the island to keep its ""diplomatic circle."" It's destined to be a costly and risky game simply because Taiwan is not a country.It's hoped Washington will also accept the reality that Taiwan's ""diplomatic allies"" are dwindling. The US is a big country with many interests. It's particularly important for Washington to follow the trend in formulating and implementing its own strategies. "	9/16/19	0	0	0.9	1
"Terry Gou's withdrawal from 2020 Taiwan leadership elections a positive development for KMT solidarity: expertsnTerry Gou Photo: VCG Taiwan business tycoon Terry Gou announced his withdrawal from the Taiwan regional leadership elections Monday, in a move that experts say could unite the Chinese Kuomintang (KMT) party and rally support behind the party's candidate Han Kuo-yu to beat the incumbent Tsai Ing-wen in the race.Gou announced that although he is dropping out of next year's Taiwan regional leadership election, he would not give up taking part in political affairs and would continue promoting his policy goals, Taiwan media Chinatimes reported.Zhang Wensheng, deputy director of the Taiwan Research Institute of Xiamen University, told the Global Times that it is a rational choice for Gou to drop out of the 2020 Taiwan leadership election, assessing that the chance of being elected would be slim. Being defeated by Han Kuo-yu in the KMT party primary poll by nearly 20 percent, Gou would have been abandoned by the blue camp (KMT supporters) in tactical voting if he insisted on staying in the race. His candidacy could have split the blue camp, enabling a victory for Tsai Ing-wen, said Zhang.Gou announced on April 17 that he would run in the 2020 Taiwan regional leadership election as a candidate of the pro-reunification KMT party. In July, the KMT announced that Han, mayor of Kaohsiung in the southwestern Taiwan region, had won the KMT primary poll and would represent the KMT in the 2020 Taiwan regional leadership election.On September 12, Gou announced his withdrawal from the KMT party in a statement, which has led to assumptions that he may run in the election as an independent candidate.Most of Han Kuo-yu's supporters are grassroots citizens, while supporters of Gou are mostly elites and people from industrial and commercial fields who assume Gou will contribute to Taiwan's economic development and better handle the relations with the Chinese mainland and the US, Zhang told the Global Times. However, Zhang also noted that both candidates' supporters have a common consensus in defeating Tsai Ing-wen, which makes Gou's withdrawal beneficial for the solidarity within the KMT party.Tsai Ing-wen, the current leader of Taiwan region has confirmed that she will run for Taiwan's top leader in 2020. For the three years Tsai has been in office, Taiwan has made little progress in improving living standards. Currently, Taiwan people are more concerned about the economy and their living standards as well as the improvement of cross-Straits relations, rather than the closeness between the island of Taiwan and the US, which the Tsai authority often brags about, observers said.Former Taiwan ""vice-president"" Lu Hsiu-lien also announced on Monday that she will run for the 2020 Taiwan regional leadership election as an independent candidate.

Gou probably will stand up for Han as his next step,"" Yang said.Gou announced April 17 that he would run in the 2020 Taiwan regional leadership election.Enthusiasm for Gou was interpreted by Chinese mainland analysts as evidence that the people in the island want a respite from the worsening cross-Straits situation caused by the pro-secession DPP which currently governs the island.

Photo: VCG RELATED ARTICLES: Terry Gou announces election bid Terry Gou is unlikely to split the Chinese Kuomintang (KMT) party and will probably support Han Kuo-yu who just won the KMT party primary poll to run in the 2020 Taiwan regional leadership election, a Chinese mainland expert said on Monday.The KMT announced Monday that Han, mayor of Kaohsiung in the southwestern Taiwan region, had won the KMT primary poll and would represent the KMT in the 2020 Taiwan regional leadership election.Han won with an average support rate of 47 percent, defeating his challenger Gou, founder of Foxconn Technology Group, by nearly 20 percent in the party's primary, said udn.com.""Unlike the strong anti-mainland stance of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Han gained a lot of hardcore supporters because of his relatively pragmatic cross-Straits policy and effective improvement of people's livelihood on the island,"" said Yang Danzhi, an expert on Asia-Pacific strategy at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.""The Chinese mainland, however, must have a clear understanding of the two-faced behavior of politicians in Taiwan, and treat them calmly and in a smart way.""Han previously rejected the ""one country, two systems"" proposal in June and said Taiwan would only accept it ""over my dead body.""Han will compete with the island's current elected leader Tsai Ing-wen, to run in the 2020 Taiwan regional leadership election.Gou later issued a concession statement, saying that he congratulated Han on winning the primary poll and blessed him, but he did not mention what his next step would be.""It is unlikely that Gou will quit the KMT and compete as an independent candidate for next year's leadership election,"" Yang said.""He joined the election at a pretty late time and it seems that he was just trying to test the water of public opinion of Taiwan. Gou probably will stand up for Han as his next step,"" Yang said.Gou announced April 17 that he would run in the 2020 Taiwan regional leadership election.Enthusiasm for Gou was interpreted by Chinese mainland analysts as evidence that the people in the island want a respite from the worsening cross-Straits situation caused by the pro-secession DPP which currently governs the island.

"China ‘highly appreciates’ Solomon Islands’ cutting Taiwan tiesnSolomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare. File photo: VCG China on Monday said it highly appreciates the Solomon Islands' decision to cut the ""diplomatic ties"" with the island of Taiwan and acknowledge the one-China principle.""We support the important decision made by the Solomon Islands as an independent sovereign country,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a statement released at the website of the ministry Monday night.The decision to acknowledge the one-China principle and establish diplomatic ties with China once again proved that the principle corresponds with the will of the people and the irresistible trend of the times, said Hua.China would like to make efforts with the Solomon Islands to explore a broader future of the development of relations between the two countries, said Hua.The Solomon Islands congress will break ""diplomatic ties"" with the island of Taiwan and switch to Beijing, Taipei-based news agency CNA reported on Monday.Taiwan's ""Foreign Minister"" Joseph Wu said in Taipei late Monday that it would immediately close down its ""embassy"" and recall all its diplomats, Reuters reported on Monday.The switch takes Taiwan's ""diplomatic allies"" down to 16.Taiwan is suffering strong diplomatic unrest under the Tsai Ing-wen authority, losing five ""diplomatic allies"" since Tsai was elected leader of the island in 2016.Chinese mainland observers of Taiwan affairs and Pacific politics noted that the move was in line with a general trend that the international community recognizes the one-China principle.Rumors of the Solomon Islands' shift from Taiwan to the Chinese mainland have spread for months.The Solomon Islands' break from Taiwan is a heavy blow to secessionists, especially leader Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election in January with her Democratic Progressive Party, Yang Lixian, a research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center of Cross-Straits Relations, told the Global Times on Monday.Li Fei, a professor at the Taiwan Research Institute of Xiamen University in East China's Fujian Province, told the Global Times that if the Chinese mainland agrees to build diplomatic ties with the Solomon Islands, it will be seen as a move to punish the Tsai authority for its close involvement in the Hong Kong unrest.Secessionists in Taiwan and Hong Kong should understand their attempts to split China go against the general trend and are ""doomed to fail,"" Li said.More countries in the South Pacific may join the Solomon Islands in cutting ties with Taiwan.""Considering the strong influence of the US in the Caribbean Sea, it may take some time for Taiwan's remaining 'diplomatic allies' to sever ties with Taiwan,"" Li said.""Haiti may be next,"" said Li.Haiti was planning to cut ties, Wang Hau-yu, a ""councilor"" of Taoyuan city in Taiwan, posted on Facebook. A wooden house in the world heritage site of East Rennell in Solomon Islands. (Photo: Xinhua) Building ties with the Chinese mainland favors the general public on the Solomon Islands, said Yu Lei, a chief research fellow at the research center for Pacific island countries of Liaocheng University in East China's Shandong Province.The Solomon Islands is a country with a small territorial area and population, Yu said, and its economic development depends heavily on foreign aid.""In recent years, the country has developed good economic and trade ties with the Chinese mainland,"" he said.Countries like the US, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France and the UK still try to influence island countries, he noted.They force countries to buck ties with the Chinese mainland by means such as threatening to cut aid altogether, economic sanctions, supporting anti-government forces or using local NGOs to pressure governments.The Solomon Islands' move shows that countries with ""diplomatic ties"" with the island of Taiwan have a ""general feeling of insecurity,"" Lü Cuncheng, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times.The international community recognizes the one-China principle and worries about the rampant tendency of ""Taiwan independence,"" Lü said.It was the general trend to develop friendly relations with the Chinese mainland, he believed.""The island of Taiwan worries about the situation and will step up to maintain ties, but they cannot change the general trend,"" Lü said. ""Countries will build relations based on their own national interests.""There might not be much more cutting of relations with Taiwan approaching the 2020 Taiwan election s, Lü predicted.""But for sure countries with 'diplomatic ties' with the island will be fewer and fewer,"" he said.There is no specific data about the number of ethnic Chinese or Chinese nationals on the Solomon Islands. But a database from the China Center for Economic Research indicated thousands of Chinese people living there.Li Lin, an employee at a mining company on the Solomon Islands, told the Global Times that many Chinese reside there. She said at least 70 percent of shops in the capital Honiara are run by Chinese.Most Chinese were looking forward to diplomatic ties, Li said.""People here have been gossiping about the news recently. Local newspapers are also reporting it,"" Li said.""We of course hope the Chinese mainland could build diplomatic ties with the Solomon Islands as soon as possible.""Li complained there was ""no embassy"" for Chinese on the islands.""The embassy is the backbone of Chinese people abroad. With diplomatic ties, we can feel secure.""Chinese nationals currently must go to the embassy in Papua New Guinea, said Zheng Yangxu, a teacher from East China's Shandong Province.Chinese tourists like visiting small South Pacific islands, an employee from a Chinese travel agency, who preferred to be called Lee, told the Global Times.""No tourist packages to the Solomon Islands can be found on online travel platforms,"" Lee said.An email to the Solomon Islands' Ministry of Foreign Affairs and External Trade from the Global Times had not received a reply as of press time.

"127 of the world’s top 500 firms have wrong listing of Taiwan, HK and Macao: researchnA map of China with caption reading ""China without any part left out"" Photo: People's Daily Sina Weibo account Among the world's top 500 companies in 2018, 80 percent of them that mark the geography of China's Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan on their official sites or their apps' China maps, have wrong or inappropriate referencing of the three regions, a report of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) showed.The study themed ""the condition of multinational corporations' complying with the one-China principle"" found that out of 2018 world's top 500 companies, 158 of them have relevancy on the matter, but 127 of them are either making mistakes or not appropriately referencing the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Macao SAR, and the island of Taiwan, accounting for more than 80 percent.Among the 127 companies with incorrect or inappropriate listing of China's Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan, seven are Chinese companies, including AIA Group, Midea Group, Quanta Computer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, CK Hutchison Holdings, Wistron Corp, and Fubon Financial Holdings.Only 30 foreign companies have the correct referencing of the three regions. A total of 34 out of 44 US companies use the wrong listing, 29 of them list Taiwan separately, 27 of them list Hong Kong separately, and six of them list Macao separately. There is no single US company that lists Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao as parts of China at the same time, the survey showed.The survey was jointly carried out by the Institute of Law of the CASS and the Internet Development Research Institution of Peking University. The survey's results will be collected in the 2019 Blue Book on Rule of Law in Cyberspace.The one-China principle is a legal fact recognized by international law. All international public or private sector actors, including multinational corporations should comply with this principle, Zhi Zhenfeng, a researcher with the CASS and the chief editor of the ""Blue Book"" told the Global Times on Tuesday.But the condition of multinational corporations' complying with the one-China principle is not optimistic, Zhi said.In August, international famous brands like COACH, Versace and Swarovski were exposed of listing Hong Kong and Taiwan as countries, prompting strong criticism. Afterwards, many of them apologized and changed their listings.The Civil Aviation Administration of China mailed 44 foreign airlines in April 2018, asking them to correct their mistakes on their official websites that were against the one-China principle and Chinese law on their official sites.This year marked the survey's second release. Comparing the results of the two surveys, 67 percent of top companies, such as Nissan Motor Co and Hitachi, didn't correct their mistakes; 13.4 percent of companies, including as Citigroup, ArcelorMittal, and Auchan, got worse and began making mistakes in referencing the three regions; and 10.9 percent of companies didn't list Hong Kong out of China last year but made the mistake this year, such as Societe Generale and MetLife Inc.The latest survey also found that some multinational corporations had corrected their mistakes, such as Siemens, Royal Dutch Shell Group, and Procter & Gamble.More companies have started to realize the importance of respecting the one-China principle, Zhi said, but the overall condition is still not optimistic.The study group said to curb the misuse or inappropriate reference, such behaviors need to be punished severely. The inspection of related departments and the self-check of companies should be enhanced. The public is also encouraged to report and monitor any breaches.Global Times "	9/11/19	0	0	-0.9589	-1
"Mainland clients seeking IVF services in Taiwan probably to halve after suspension of individual tripsnAdvances in preimplantation genetic screening in China, where the world's first test-tube baby was born using this technique in 2012, are giving infertile couples greater IVF possibilities closer to home. Photo: CFP Taiwan's in vitro fertilization (IVF) industry, popular with some mainland patients seeking children, has been hit by suspension of visits for mainland individual trips to the island starting August 1.A staff member at Taipei Medical University Hospital told the Global Times on Monday that she had noticed an apparent decline in mainland patients since the suspension.Mainland residents must now spend up to about one month applying for a medical visa to Taiwan whereas previously they could use a three-to-five day exit-entry permit for IVF treatment in Taiwan.The change hit Taiwan IVF providers with mainland clients, especially smaller hospitals and clinics that specialize in IVF treatment but cannot help mainland clients with a medical visa, a staff member told the Global Times reporter who pretended to be a potential client.To obtain a medical visa, patients must provide materials including certificate of spouse relationship: a more complicated procedure than an exit and entry permit, according to a second staff member at Lee Women's Hospital in Taichung.Meanwhile on the mainland, an employee of an IVF service agent based in Shenzhen, South China's Guangdong Province, told the Global Times that some clients have decided to go to other countries such as Thailand where they could receive similar treatment at a similar price but with a simpler procedure.Many mainland spouses who have difficulty in conceiving reportedly chose Taiwan for IVF therapy especially after the mainland's second-child policy was fully implemented in October 2015.IVF industry staff employed in both Taiwan and the Chinese mainland estimated that the suspension would probably halve mainland clients seeking IVF services in Taiwan in the short term.How much mainland business for the Taiwan IVF industry was allowed to recover by Beijing would likely depend on the results of the 2020 Taiwan election , they predicted.

"US will never ‘free’ HK, only destabilize China: expertnHong Kong police confiscate a shopping cart filled with makeshift weapons after dispersing a crowd of illegal protesters in Causeway Bay on Sunday night. Photo: Wang Cong/GT US role As US politicians continue to fan the flames in Hong Kong, Sunday's mass rally, aimed at pushing the US into passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, showed how protesters broke the bottom line, observers noted.The protest followed a series of violent clashes over the past few nights when mobs vandalized subway stations and other facilities, engaged in arson on the streets and violently charged police officers.At about 2:40 pm, hundreds deviated from an assembly point in Chater Garden and moved toward the US Consulate General located in Central Hong Kong.Some bus services were suspended and public places in the vicinity were closed.Black-clad individuals with their faces covered in black masks attended the scene.Some held iron sticks, a common makeshift weapon used by radicals over the past few weeks.Many protesters held US flags and some held photos of US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.On one of Trump's photos, he was pictured alongside guns.More English slogans such as ""Free Hong Kong"" could be seen than in those of previous protests. Some protesters also called for the US to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. UK and German flags could also be spotted on the scene.""The Americans will not 'free' Hong Kong, but will only destabilize China, including Hong Kong, so as to hit hard their perceived competitor,"" said Chan Yung, vice-chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong.Clear-minded Hong Kong citizens must say 'no' to selling Hong Kong this way, Chan told the Global Times on Sunday.Tian Feilong, an associate professor at Beihang University in Beijing and an expert on Hong Kong studies, believes the appeal by Hong Kong protesters is evidence that they collude with external forces to jeopardize Hong Kong's international status and fundamental interests.The city government announced on Wednesday a four-action plan to start dialogue with all walks of life to ease the current situation.But US politicians have continuously fanned the flames. Both Republican and Democratic members of the US Congress are pushing for the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act as soon as possible. Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Ben Cardin are among those sponsoring passage of the bill.The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act is an amendment to the Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 which allows the US government to afford Hong Kong trade and business privileges.One of the most important provisions of the proposed bill is that officials of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government who are found suppressing Hong Kong's democracy, human rights or citizen freedoms can have their assets in the US frozen and be denied entry to the US.On Twitter, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi posted ""If we don't speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interests, we lose all moral authority to speak out elsewhere,"" referring to the introduction of the act and bipartisan consensus around it.Regarding the statement, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said at Friday's media briefing that China deplores and firmly opposes US senators' attempted move to push the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act as interfering in China's internal affairs.Tian said the US-proposed act is an evident show of interference in China's domestic affairs which violates international law and international relations principles.However, it is very likely that the US will pass the bill, Tian noted. ""After the trade issue, the next card the US is to play is Hong Kong and Taiwan affairs,"" said Tian.Tian also suggested China should prepare for financial risks and the possible change of Hong Kong's financial status amid US interference, speed up development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and further expand its support for Hong Kong. A view of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) special section at the China International Financial Expo in Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong Province.

It can also list them as unwelcome people and ban them from entering Chinese territory,"" Tian noted. "	9/8/19	0	0	-0.7657	-1
"PLA conducts joint land assault exercises near TaiwannAmphibious armored vehicles attached to a brigade of the PLA Navy Marine Corps make their way to the beach-head during a maritime amphibious assault training in the west of south China's Guangdong Province on August 17, 2019. Photo: eng.chinamil.com.cn The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) recently conducted a joint land assault exercise featuring multiple military branches near the island of Taiwan, which military experts said on Sunday shows the Chinese military is ready to unleash its full potential against Taiwan secessionist forces and intends to send a stern warning to countries that intervene in China's internal affairs.The 74th Group Army of the PLA recently held a joint land assault exercise off the eastern coast of South China's Guangdong Province, with the navy and air force joining the simulated attack, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Thursday.Led by the navy's amphibious assault ships, with additional air support, a combined arms brigade of the army launched a joint assault on a coastal area.Navy minesweepers and obstacle breaking boats first cleared a path through the sea, and amphibious assault vehicles of the army stormed to the coast from multiple directions.As the army closed in on the coast, warplanes, artilleries and tanks launched simulated joint strikes from multiple points and successfully seized the position.While the defending team attempted counterattacks, the army called in air strikes from a communications command platform, guiding fighter aircraft and long-range rockets that eliminated the defender's threat.""We upgraded our system so that battlefield data can be shared in real time. Intelligence gathered by the navy, air force and ourselves on the battlefield can be reported to the command center, and shared between basic units,"" Liu Shuyi, staff officer of the combined arms brigade, told CCTV.Joint operations are essential in modern warfare, especially during landing missions, which are usually complicated as defenders usually have the advantage, an anonymous military expert told the Global Times on Sunday.The PLA used to conduct exercises within single military branches during which the army, navy and air force were trained on their own, the expert said, noting that joint training exercises could help the PLA make the best of its full potential.Although the report did not identify an imaginary enemy for the exercises, Chinese internet users noted the location of the exercises was close to the island of Taiwan.After the US approved a plan to sell $2.22 billion worth of tanks and missiles to the island in July, the PLA also conducted military exercises off the coast of Guangdong.The US went on to approve an $8 billion sale of fighter jets to the island in August, military analysts predicted at that time that a new round of military drills was likely to follow.

Netizens expressed their disappointment and anger at Lung for siding with protesters and blaming mainland people for ravaging Hong Kong.""Lung showed her sympathy for protesters without respecting mainland people's voice and feelings,"" a net user living in the island of Taiwan said on Facebook.""Who is ruining the social order in the name of democracy?

Or she means only Western police have the right to enforce the law while Hong Kong police deserve to be beaten by rioters, Huang said.People's Daily on Wednesday questioned on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo why Lung ""only sees eggs while turning a blind eye on petrol bombs.""""Protesters burned streets, destroyed subway facilities and paralyzed the airport…They are not eggs but hammers,"" the newspaper said, noting Lung was driving a wedge between Hong Kong and the mainland.""Lung and some celebrities like her used selective reports to incite conflict between Chinese mainland and Hong Kong residents for their own political purposes,"" An Yukang, a Beijing-based cultural critic, told the Global Times on Thursday.These people are an important reason for the escalating chaos in Hong Kong, said An.She blamed the mainland for not showing sympathy to rioters when the central government and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government are highly restrained, An said.

"US accountable for all Taiwan arms sales consequences: spokespersonnRELATED ARTICLES: US arms sales to Taiwan will lead to serious consequences The United States is accountable for all consequences of its arms sales to Taiwan, a spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense said Thursday.The one-China principle is the political foundation for the China-US relationship, said the spokesperson Ren Guoqiang at a press conference when asked about the US approval of arms sales to Taiwan.It is a pity that the United States repeatedly violated the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques, Ren said.Arms sales to Taiwan will not change the historical trend of China's reunification, Ren said, noting that the move will only send wrong signals to ""Taiwan independence"" forces and deteriorate the situation across the Taiwan Strait.""We have resolute will, abundant confidence and sufficient ability to defeat any form of interference of enternal forces and separatist acts of 'Taiwan independence,'"" Ren said.""We will take all necessary measures to safeguard our interests.

"EY two-faced about stance on China’s territorynPhoto: IC If the Big Four accounting firms cannot clarify their stance on China's territory and sovereignty to be both externally and internally correct, their businesses in the Chinese market cannot be sustained, analysts told the Global Times.In the internal system of Ernst & Young (EY), one of the Big Four accounting firms, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan are listed as ""countries"" independent of China in the geography search, according to several screenshots that an employee of EY's Hong Kong branch sent to the Global Times over the weekend.Such listings have caused mounting dissatisfaction among its employees in Hong Kong who respect the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and firmly support the ""one country, two systems"" principle, the source said, speaking anonymously.EY said in a note sent to the Global Times on Sunday that it has clearly revised its categorization method in the area of ""country/region"" for related lists in terms of its internal system.""EY firmly stands for the principle of 'one country, two systems' and the Basic Law,"" it said.The Global Times found that on EY's official website, Hong Kong is referred as HKSAR and the SAR, along with the island of Taiwan and Macao SAR, is listed under the Greater China category.The EY staff also urged the company, as one of the Big Four accounting firms whose business focus is in the Chinese mainland, to take measures to penalize its anti-government employees and secessionists.""The global accounting firm is obviously showing a two-faced stance on recognizing China's territory since its official website and internal system represent two different attitudes,"" said Dong Shaopeng, a deputy managing editor of Securities Daily and an advisor to the China Securities Regulatory Commission.If the company retains its secessionist stance toward the internal staff and does not correct its mistake after a deep understanding, its business in China will not be sustainable, according to Dong.""Respecting a nation's sovereignty is the basic knowledge that a global company should have,"" Dong added.As some international companies often purchase IT kit packages for listing countries and regions directly from developers, the wrong listing could be a result of mistakes made by the original developer, a staff member of a Hong Kong financial institution, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Global Times on Sunday.""But EY's IT system manager and the company's internal management teams should have a monitoring mechanism to take care of such issues. They must realize that respecting China's territorial sovereignty is its Chinese clients' bottom line,"" the staff member said.He said he also suspected the accounting firm did it intentionally.Although EY has established an office in Hong Kong, its main business is in the Chinese mainland, the employee said, indicating that EY could face strong criticism and pay a hefty price in China for such an incorrect listing. ""EY should correct such listings immediately.""The Global Times also found that on the websites of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and KPMG that China is separated when choosing an office site.China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan are four parallel items when clicking ""choose a territory"" as shown on the website of PwC.A PR representative told the Global Times on Sunday that ""territory is different from country.""PwC was the first one to come out and clarify the protest situation in Hong Kong, claiming that it is not supporting the riots in the SAR. The statement was issued in early August after some Chinese people said the company's previous statement was a fence-sitting approach in dealing with the Hong Kong protests.For KPMG, Taiwan does not fall under China although Hong Kong and Macau do. The company did not reply to a Global Times email inquiry as of press time. "	8/25/19	0	0	0.9203	1
"China vows to impose sanctions on US firmsnA US-made F-16V fighter jet takes off from the freeway in Changhua county, Taiwan, as a crowd takes photos during the annual Han Kuang drill on May 28, 2019. Photo: AFP China has vowed to impose sanctions on US firms participating in arms sales to Taiwan after the US State Department announced that the Trump administration had given formal approval for the sale of fighter jets and other military aircraft to the island worth $8 billion.The Trump administration's approval of another major arms sales to Taiwan, which includes 66 F-16 fighter jets, could be the heaviest-ever test of China-US relations, observers said on Wednesday.At a press conference on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said, ""US arms sales to Taiwan severely violate international law and the basic principles of international relationships, the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués, especially the August 17 communiqué.""China firmly opposes the arms sales which ""constitutes severe interference in China's internal affairs and undermines China's sovereignty and security interests,"" Geng said.""China urges the US to fully recognize the harmful nature of the arms sales to Taiwan, immediately cancel the planned arms sales, stop selling weapons and end military contact with Taiwan,"" said Geng, warning that ""otherwise, the US will have to bear all the consequences.""CNN reported Wednesday that the weapons sales received strong bipartisan backing in Congress. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the sale of the F-16s ""is consistent with the arrangements, the historical relationship between the US and China, [and] our actions are consistent with past US policy. We are simply following through on the commitments we've made to all of the parties.""The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), which oversees US foreign military sales, said in a statement that the State Department has made a determination approving a possible foreign military sale to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office for 66 F-16C/D Block 70 aircraft and related equipment - including F-110 General Electric engines - and support for an estimated cost of $8 billion. The DSCA delivered the required certification notifying Congress of the possible sale on Tuesday.The contentious arms sales to Taiwan shows a lack of basic respect for China's sovereignty, said Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University's Institute of International Relations in Beijing.In July, the US also approved an arms sale to Taiwan worth $2.22 billion, including 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger portable surface-to-air missiles, CNN reported.After the US approved the tank and missile sales in July, China conducted military exercises in waters near the island of Taiwan. China also announced sanctions on US enterprises participating in the sale.""This round of US arms sales to Taiwan will likely impact China-US bilateral ties to the greatest extent ever, given the deteriorating state of trade relations, which were once considered the ballast of overall bilateral ties,"" Li said.Also on Tuesday, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) posted on its Facebook account pictures of its head officer Brent Christensen visiting Zuoying Naval Base in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The US official took pictures of a Kee-Lung-class guided-missile destroyer and AAV7 Assault Amphibious Vehicle at the base, which were both acquired from the US.AIT also said in the post that ""The US sells Taiwan defense equipment in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act to maintain regional peace and stability. But did you know that US-Taiwan security cooperation includes much more?""Such a provocative move is designed to further hype the Taiwan question, creating bad blood across the Taiwan Straits, to create an unstable atmosphere to hinder China's development, Li said.The US arms sales are sending dangerous signals to the island's secessionist forces, and the ultimate goal is to contain China's growth by creating cross-Straits tensions, said Li.The US has become more willing to play the Taiwan card as ties with China worsen, since less common interests are at stake when doing so, Zhang Jiadong, deputy director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, told the Global Times.Stephen Bryen, who served as a senior staff director of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a signed article published in Asia Times on Monday that ""while not finally decided, Taiwan will be training with the new F-16V aircraft in the US, on the west coast, and learn how to coordinate their F-16Vs with American F-35s.""Bryen proposed that Taiwan's ""lack of the F-35 does not remove the F-35 from the game. In fact, the new F-16's ability to work with US-run F-35s is an important advantage for Taiwan and changes the defense environment profoundly.""Instead of Taiwan relying on a far-off, belated arrival of a US aircraft carrier to bail out a Taiwan under siege, US warplanes and Taiwan's upgraded fleet could coordinate their operations in a crisis, he said.Chinese military expert Wei Dongxu noted that ""such coordinated training of F16Vs and F-35s is more symbolic than actual use.""""In actual combat, the theoretical information sharing between the two types of fighter jets would become unrealizable, as the F-16, which is non-stealth, will be easily taken down by China's J-20 over the horizon,"" Wei said.The Chinese mainland enjoys a vast military advantage over the island of Taiwan despite the island's purchase of the 66 new fighter jets from the US, observers said.

"China’s ‘unreliable entity list’ imminentn China is preparing to launch a widely anticipated ""unreliable entity list,"" the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said Thursday, as expectations for the mechanism to severely punish companies that have undermined China's national interests continue to grow. While initiated as a response to the US crackdown on Chinese tech companies, the mechanism, once launched, could also be deployed to punish companies that hurt China's sovereignty regarding Taiwan and Hong Kong, and the punishment could be crippling given China's massive economic power, Chinese analysts noted. The ""unreliable entity list"" mechanism is currently going through internal deliberations and ""will be announced in the near future,"" Gao Feng, a spokesperson for MOFCOM, told a press briefing on Thursday. Gao did not provide a timetable for the release of the list, first announced in May and widely viewed as China's response to the US ""entity list."" The US has used the list to crack down on Chinese companies such as Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies. Aiming to increase pressure on Huawei, the US Commerce Department Monday added 46 affiliates of the Chinese telecom giant to its ""entity list."" Gao reiterated Thursday China's firm opposition to the US move to ""deploy"" its state power to crack down on Chinese companies ""without any justification."" More candidates Gao's comment comes as an increasing number of foreign companies have drawn Beijing's ire for allegedly conspiring with the US government to undermine China's national interests. The latest case is US courier delivery company FedEx, under investigation in China after a package that FedEx delivered was found to contain a handgun. The company has also been accused of helping the US crack down on Huawei after it misrouted packages belonging to the Chinese company. Asked whether FedEx will be included in the ""unreliable entity list,"" Gao said that officials will consider four factors which have been previously disclosed. The factors include whether the entity is engaged in other discriminative actions such as cutting supplies, whether the entity violates market rules and breaches contracts for non-commercial reasons, whether the entity damages Chinese companies and whether the entity threatens China's national security. Many companies, including US suppliers of Huawei, meet those standards. UK-listed bank HSBC has also been floated as a potential target after it was reported that the bank had conspired with US officials in the case against Huawei. Standard Chartered, Citigroup and French Bank BNP have also been reported as playing a role in the case. The scope of the ""unreliable entity list"" will not be limited to the Huawei case as other foreign companies have also been accused of undermining China's national security regarding ""secessionist actions"" in Hong Kong and arms sales to Taiwan, Bai Ming, a research fellow at MOFCOM's Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times on Thursday. ""Those who ignore or challenge the one-China principle will all fall under its scope,"" Bai said. Companies in Hong Kong including airline Cathay Pacific, as well as Amazon, Facebook and Twitter, have all been criticized for supporting violent protesters in Hong Kong. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday said that China could impose sanctions on US companies involved in arms sales to Taiwan. Severe punishment Companies included in the ""unreliable entity list"" could face a potentially crippling punishment from China, which wields great power in the global economy, Chinese analysts said. ""Being added to the list will make a big dent on their businesses development not only in China but also in other markets where they have operations. For example, fundraising in local markets will be impacted,"" said Gao Lingyun, an expert with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. Punitive measures could include hefty penalties, cancellation of business licenses that are compulsory to do business in China, and a temporary or permanent ban from the Chinese market, Gao said. The ban from doing business in the massive Chinese market alone could mean huge losses for many of the companies that rely heavily on revenues from China, Gao noted. Chinese officials stressed the move was not aimed at those that operate within the law, and China still welcomes foreign companies to conduct business. The delay in the launch of the mechanism could also mean Chinese officials are trying to take a balanced approach and minimize collateral damage, analysts said. ""According to my observation, the MOFCOM is soliciting inputs among related departments on the list. The ministry will revise it based on the advice and launch it soon,"" said Gao Lingyun. Gao noted that China will likely launch the mechanism first instead of listing the companies. ""The list is not that difficult to generate but we need to take multiple factors into consideration,"" Huo Jianguo, a vice chairman of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies, told the Global Times. China is likely waiting for an appropriate time to unveil the list, Huo said. "	8/22/19	0	0	-0.9899	-1

Most analysts believe that it will only take the PLA hours to take down the island if the mainland resorts to force.

The major arms purchase could probably bring the island greater risks instead of security.Taiwan must never try to promote de jure independence. If the island goes toward the direction with the salami-slicing strategy, it will only accumulate risks for itself. Taiwan must not act as a puppet of the US to contain the Chinese mainland.

[fighting]""On social network platforms like LIHKG and Telegram which are often used by anti-government groups, internet users in Taiwan take photos of their identity cards and send cheerful notes to encourage young Hongkongers to continue taking to the streets.On social network platforms like LIHKG and Telegram which are often used by anti-government groups, internet users in Taiwan take photos of their identity cards and send cheerful notes to encourage young Hongkongers to continue taking to the streets.Anti-government forces and secessionists from the island of Taiwan are coordinating with each other to challenge the central government in Beijing and the ""one China, two systems"" policy, the Chinese experts warn.Hong Kong protesters broke into the Legislative Council Complex on July 1, spray-painting slogans such as ""Sunflower HK,"" referring to the 2014 ""Sunflower Movement"" against the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement signed between the mainland and Taiwan.Lin Fei-fan, a Taiwan activist who led the Sunflower Movement, right away defended rioters on social media.Some media on the island of Taiwan and in Hong Kong also called it ""Taiwan Sunflower Movement in HK"" as it recreated a scene reminiscent of the takeover of the ""Legislative Yuan"" in Taipei in 2014.Taiwan has now become a haven for rioters who fled Hong Kong to seek asylum on the island after breaking the law by storming LegCo on July 1, according to media reports.Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen has tweeted frequently on Hong Kong, saying ""the international community is seriously concerned about the clashes between police and protesters in Hong Kong.""Some Taiwan people have been channeling funds and supplies to Hong Kong anti-government protesters.On social media, pictures have suggested that some people on the island are holding fundraising activities for Hong Kong protesters: Sales of hard hats and gas masks are reportedly rising rapidly.Protesters from Hong Kong also buy their supplies from stores in Taipei and ship them to the city.Taiwan companies like ForFun Creative authorized some souvenir pin products as a way of supporting the protesters and part of the revenue is said to be channeled to the movement.Chiu Yi, a former Kuomintang legislator, said Tsai ""behind the scenes"" has been providing financial support and training for guerilla-style street fights and violent attacks, helping agitate and mislead the public while backing asylum for Hong Kong secessionists.Tsai has four purposes for her behavior, Chiu explained.""First, she coordinates with the US to play the Hong Kong card to show to the US that she is an obedient and useful pawn,"" Chiu said.""Second, she aims to destroy 'one country, two systems' and jeopardize cross-Straits expectations of reunification. Third, she wants to stoke anti-mainland sentiment in Taiwan so as to win support for next year's election. Fourth, by collaborating with Hong Kong secessionist forces, she can easily get down to her 'two countries' path,"" Chiu said.Chan King, vice president of the Hong Kong Chinese Importers' & Exporters' Association, told the Global Times that the Hong Kong unrest resulted from ""collusion between pro-secession activists in the two regions.""Meddling in Hong Kong affairs and leading the city into chaos meant ""Tsai was trying to prove that 'one country, two systems' is a failure and hinders the peaceful reunification of the island of Taiwan with the Chinese mainland,"" Chan said.He urged the public to have a clearer view of such motives behind the anti-government movement in Hong Kong.Wang Jiang, an associate research fellow at the institute of law, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, said he believes that Taiwan authorities played the card of freedom and democracy to attract the eyeballs of some Western countries.""The mainland's suspension of individual trips to the island of Taiwan has already been a countermeasure,"" Wang said.Wang Wenwen contributed to the story "	8/21/19	0	0	0.5627	1
"China vows to impose sanctions on US firmsnA US-made F-16V fighter jet takes off from the freeway in Changhua county, Taiwan, as a crowd takes photos during the annual Han Kuang drill on May 28, 2019. Photo: AFP China has vowed to impose sanctions on US firms participating in arms sales to Taiwan after the US State Department announced that the Trump administration had given formal approval for the sale of fighter jets and other military aircraft to the island worth $8 billion.The Trump administration's approval of another major arms sales to Taiwan, which includes 66 F-16 fighter jets, could be the heaviest-ever test of China-US relations, observers said on Wednesday.At a press conference on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said, ""US arms sales to Taiwan severely violate international law and the basic principles of international relationships, the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués, especially the August 17 communiqué.""China firmly opposes the arms sales which ""constitutes severe interference in China's internal affairs and undermines China's sovereignty and security interests,"" Geng said.""China urges the US to fully recognize the harmful nature of the arms sales to Taiwan, immediately cancel the planned arms sales, stop selling weapons and end military contact with Taiwan,"" said Geng, warning that ""otherwise, the US will have to bear all the consequences.""CNN reported Wednesday that the weapons sales received strong bipartisan backing in Congress. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the sale of the F-16s ""is consistent with the arrangements, the historical relationship between the US and China, [and] our actions are consistent with past US policy. We are simply following through on the commitments we've made to all of the parties.""The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), which oversees US foreign military sales, said in a statement that the State Department has made a determination approving a possible foreign military sale to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office for 66 F-16C/D Block 70 aircraft and related equipment - including F-110 General Electric engines - and support for an estimated cost of $8 billion. The DSCA delivered the required certification notifying Congress of the possible sale on Tuesday.The contentious arms sales to Taiwan shows a lack of basic respect for China's sovereignty, said Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University's Institute of International Relations in Beijing.In July, the US also approved an arms sale to Taiwan worth $2.22 billion, including 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger portable surface-to-air missiles, CNN reported.After the US approved the tank and missile sales in July, China conducted military exercises in waters near the island of Taiwan. China also announced sanctions on US enterprises participating in the sale.""This round of US arms sales to Taiwan will likely impact China-US bilateral ties to the greatest extent ever, given the deteriorating state of trade relations, which were once considered the ballast of overall bilateral ties,"" Li said.Also on Tuesday, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) posted on its Facebook account pictures of its head officer Brent Christensen visiting Zuoying Naval Base in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The US official took pictures of a Kee-Lung-class guided-missile destroyer and AAV7 Assault Amphibious Vehicle at the base, which were both acquired from the US.AIT also said in the post that ""The US sells Taiwan defense equipment in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act to maintain regional peace and stability. But did you know that US-Taiwan security cooperation includes much more?""Such a provocative move is designed to further hype the Taiwan question, creating bad blood across the Taiwan Straits, to create an unstable atmosphere to hinder China's development, Li said.The US arms sales are sending dangerous signals to the island's secessionist forces, and the ultimate goal is to contain China's growth by creating cross-Straits tensions, said Li.The US has become more willing to play the Taiwan card as ties with China worsen, since less common interests are at stake when doing so, Zhang Jiadong, deputy director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, told the Global Times.Stephen Bryen, who served as a senior staff director of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a signed article published in Asia Times on Monday that ""while not finally decided, Taiwan will be training with the new F-16V aircraft in the US, on the west coast, and learn how to coordinate their F-16Vs with American F-35s.""Bryen proposed that Taiwan's ""lack of the F-35 does not remove the F-35 from the game. In fact, the new F-16's ability to work with US-run F-35s is an important advantage for Taiwan and changes the defense environment profoundly.""Instead of Taiwan relying on a far-off, belated arrival of a US aircraft carrier to bail out a Taiwan under siege, US warplanes and Taiwan's upgraded fleet could coordinate their operations in a crisis, he said.Chinese military expert Wei Dongxu noted that ""such coordinated training of F16Vs and F-35s is more symbolic than actual use.""""In actual combat, the theoretical information sharing between the two types of fighter jets would become unrealizable, as the F-16, which is non-stealth, will be easily taken down by China's J-20 over the horizon,"" Wei said.The Chinese mainland enjoys a vast military advantage over the island of Taiwan despite the island's purchase of the 66 new fighter jets from the US, observers said.

"Global Blue becomes latest firm to risk Chinese consumer boycott over sovereigntynGlobal Blue, a Switzerland-based tourism shopping tax refund company, triggered outrage among Chinese netizens after it listed Hong Kong as an independent country in its refund system, and one of its customer service staff later claimed that China's island of Taiwan is also ""an independent country.""The company on Saturday officially responded on Chinese Weibo that they would sack the staff member immediately and noted that the company firmly supports China's territorial integrity and sovereignty. However, Chinese netizens are not satisfied with what they consider to be a glib statement and are urging the company to show proof of the firing and correct related mistakes.A Chinese customer earlier found that Global Blue listed China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region as an ""independent country"" in the company's refund system. In an email the customer sent to the company, he urged them to correct the mistake as soon as possible.However, a customer service representative named Eva J answered that there have been cases of Macao, Hong Kong and Taiwan passport holders being refused by customs after filling in China on their tax return forms. ""Taiwan is an independent country and not part of China,"" she added.The screenshots of the email have been circulating on China's Twitter-like social media platform Weibo.""A single statement on Weibo is not enough, the company should post apologies on overseas social media platforms as well,"" some netizens said. ""The executive of the customer service department should also be fired.""Global Times reporters noted that Hong Kong is now been shown as ""Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China"" on the company's website, while Taiwan could not be found in the selection as of Sunday noon.Global Blue is not the first to harm Chinese consumers' national sentiments recently. Foreign brands, including some world-renowned fashion houses, have been found making similar mistakes and then lining up to issue statements to clarify that they agreed that Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan are inalienable part of China.Yang Qingshan, an expert at the luxury research center of the University of International Business and Economics, told the Global Times in a recent interview that China's territorial integrity and sovereignty is a solid red line which can never be crossed by any country or company.

"Mainland company sends zhacai to Taiwan economist who mocked mainlanders as poornPhoto shows Wujiang Fuling Zhacai sold in a supermarket in Shanghai. Photo: VCG A Chinese mainland company has sent a box of zhacai, or pickled vegetables, to the headquarters of a Taiwanese talk show program after a Taiwan economist made an appearance on an episode to mock the idea that mainland residents cannot afford zhacai.Zhaicai is one of the most commonly eaten foods that mainlanders eat together with rice, porridge or instant noodles. A bag of zhacai weigh about 80 grams usually costs three yuan ($0.4), while per capita disposable income of Chinese mainland residents is 28,228 yuan.Huang Shicong, an economist in Taiwan said on a talk show program ""Crucial Moment"" on August 7, that ""people in the mainland always eat zhacai together with instant noodles, but now they can't afford it.""Huang said the decline in the share price of Fuling Zhacai, a famous Chinese zhacai maker in Fuling, Southwest China's Chongqing Municipality, showed that mainland people were too poor to eat zhacai. He wrongly pronounced Fuling as Peiling.Mainlanders could not afford zhacai sounds like a gimmick, but this notion reflects that many Taiwanese are ignorant about the overwhelming development of Chinese mainland during the past tens of years, instead they blindly cling to their own prejudices, an employee of the Fuling Zhacai company who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Wednesday.""We sell more than one million tons of zhaicai, or billions of bags of zhaicai, every year,"" the employee said.The revenue of Chongqing Fuling Zhacai Group in 2018 is more than 1.9 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of about 26 percent, according to the company's annual reports.Fuling Zhacai announced on Sina Weibo on Sunday that they had delivered a box of zhacai to the program, saying that ""we are not only able to afford zhacai, but also to treat you all in the program with zhacai.""""Thanks for your efforts to promote zhacai and Chinese language culture,"" the company also said on its Weibo account.The zhacai joke is not the first case that Taiwan programs use food to mock the mainland people.On August 11 some Taiwan analysts said in another program that the price increase of Wuliangye, a well-known Chinese liquor, indicates that Chinese mainland residents are drowning their sorrows amid economic downturn.In 2011, Gao Zhibin, a scholar in Taiwan, said that tea-boiled eggs, at about 2.5 yuan a pop, are luxury food and most mainland people could not afford them.Huang's speech made a big splash on Chinese mainland social media. The trending topic of ""Taiwan program claims mainland people cannot afford zhacai"" has been viewed 980 million times as of press time.Netizens rushed to post photos of themselves being surrounded by bags of zhaicai they bought while asking ""am I rich enough?""

Celebrity Yi Yangqianxi (also known Jackson Yee) later also announced he was ending his association with Givenchy.Coach's behavior has had a serious impact on Chinese sentiment, and its behavior should be severely condemned, Liu Wen said in a statement on Sina Weibo.The products in question are T-shirts from the Coach 1941 series, featuring a list of countries and their cities on their reverse side, including ""Chicago, United States"" and ""Milan, Italy.""Four cities in China are on the list. But while Shanghai and Beijing are listed under China, Taipei is listed as ""Taipei, Taiwan,"" in a manner that separates the island of Taiwan from China. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is listed separately as ""Hong Kong,"" with no country name. A screenshot of Coach website that lists Hong Kong as a country Photo: a screen shot of Coach official website Such disrespect for China's territorial integrity is also clear on Coach's website, where it was found to list Hong Kong and Taiwan as independent countries under its ""search country"" option.

""Coach"" has become a top-trending hashtag on China's Twitter-like Weibo.Later that day, netizens also discovered similar mistakes of Givenchy and Asics, which also apologized online later.""China's territorial integrity and sovereignty is a solid red line which can never be crossed by any country or company,"" Yang Qingshan, an expert at the luxury research center of the University of International Business and Economics, told the Global Times on Monday.""It's not that they don't know, they are blatantly challenging China's bottom line,"" a netizen on Weibo said.Coach, Givenchy and Asics are not the first group of brands embroiled in controversy this week for mislabeling Chinese cities as countries.

The brand was removed from online retailers in China, such as Alibaba's Tmall and JD.com, after the event.Products or marketing strategies of these world-renowned fashion brands were all taken out after careful consideration and reflect the companies' values, Yang said, adding that if these had political motives, Chinese consumers would boycott them.The People's Daily on Monday said in a brief commentary that companies operating in China should abide by Chinese laws. These ""coincidental"" mistakes, especially during the current ""sensitive moment,"" when Hong Kong is being assaulted by secessionists, are even more egregious, and will only dim the prospects of their brand prestige in the Chinese market.""Hong Kong and Taiwan are China's territories.

"Chinese mainland suspends films, film personnel from participating in Taiwan’s Golden Horse AwardsnFeng Xiaogang poses for photos after winning the Best Director award for his movie ""I Am Not Madame Bovary"" at the 53rd Golden Horse Awards in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan, Nov. 26, 2016. The awarding ceremony of the 53rd Golden Horse Awards was held here on Saturday. (Xinhua) Chinese mainland film authorities have banned Chinese mainland movies and artists from participating in November's 56th Golden Horse Film Festival on the island of Taiwan.The China Film Administration gave no further details in its announcement of the ban.The announcement came exactly a week after mainland authorities halted a pilot program for individual mainland tourists from 47 cities to visit Taiwan.Long Mingbiao, vice director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council said the latest decision was a ""temporary suspension"" rather than a ""total severance,"" Taiwan-based news site ettoday.net reportedLong said the reason behind the suspension was clear to all, which was that the ""politi­cal situation and political ecolo­gy of Taiwan would breed many problems.""Mainland filmmaking industry insiders linked the ban to secessionist comments made at last year's film festival in November.Many Chinese mainland internet users expressed outrage last year when Taiwan filmmaker Fu Yu expressed her support for ""independence of Taiwan"" in her award acceptance speech.Later in the evening, Chinese mainland actress Gong Li, the jury chair, expressed her opposition to Yu by refusing to take the stage and present an award. And following that, mainland filmmakers and actors did not attend a dinner in protest that same evening.The festival will be in a ""very awkward position"" without Chinese mainland personnel and movies, as ""more and more movies from the Chinese mainland are winning applause worldwide and are making their presence in the film festival,""Shao Zhong-hai, a former head of the school of social sciences at Chinese Culture University in Taiwan, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Politics has affected the judgment of this film festival in recent years, asserted Shi Wenxue, a teacher at Beijing Film Academy.""Film personnel in the mainland used to take the festival as an 'art palace,' while some people in Taiwan take it as 'chance to preach politics,'"" Shi told the Global Times on Wednesday.The festival is losing its appeal on the Chinese mainland anyway, Shi said, noting that without the participation of Chinese mainland films, it is just a ""self-entertaining regional festival.""Even before the Chinese mainland film authority's statement, many Chinese mainland filmmakers already made it clear they would steer clear of this year's festival, Shi said.The Zhang Yimou movie One Second and Lyceum Theatre, starring Gong Li, were not registered for the festival, according to previous media reports.Awards from this festival are ""just a bonus,"" said a Chinese mainland independent film director, who requested anonymity.It is more important for filmmakers from the Chinese mainland to make a gesture and fight back against inappropriate behavior and comments by some artists at the festival, he said.The Chinese mainland ban sends a tough message against secessionists, Yang Lixian, a research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center of Cross-Straits Relations, told the Global Times.The executive committee of the Golden Horse Awards informed the Global Times Wednesday that they regretted the ban but festival activities would continue as usual.

"Taiwan travel industry in doom and gloom at losing mainland touristsnTourists stand in front of a store in Taiwan. File photo: IC A pilot program that allowed residents from 47 cities on the Chinese mainland to visit Taiwan as individual tourists was suspended from Thursday. Industry insiders said the travel industry in Taiwan will suffer huge losses as a result.The decision was made in light of current cross-Straits relations, said the mainland-based Association for Tourism Exchange across the Taiwan Straits, according to the notice by the association that was posted on the website of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.""The move will cause huge losses to the travel industry in the island of Taiwan, which is 40 percent dependent on the mainland, using a conservative estimation,"" an industry insider told the Global Times on Thursday on condition of anonymity. ""In terms of proportion, individual tourists and group tourists are half and half.""The pilot program was launched in 2011 as a positive measure to expand exchanges across the Taiwan Straits in the context of the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, said Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, during a press conference on Thursday.""The actions of the Democratic Progressive Party, which promotes Taiwan secession, incites hostility toward the mainland and provokes confrontation between the two sides and has seriously undermined the basis of the trial run,"" said Ma.Some 2.7 million mainland tourists visited Taiwan in 2018, the lowest number in six years, according to the office of transportation and communications of Taiwan.

"Taiwan accused of manipulating HK unrest for harboring riotersnRadical protesters in Hong Kong block a road and assault police. Their behavior was widely condemned. Photo: Fan Lingzhi/GT While busy inciting and participating in a series of riots and other illegal activities in Hong Kong over the past two months, radical forces were seemingly also trying to find themselves a hiding place outside of Hong Kong, as reports revealed that some 30 individuals have already escaped to Taiwan.Analysts believe that the island of Taiwan openly shields members of mobs, proving that Taiwan has become the sheltered paradise for Hong Kong criminals.According to Hong Kong media, several radicals and Hong Kong secessionists have fled to Taiwan. Among them were secessionist Joe Yeung Yat-long, the former president of the Hong Kong Shue Yan University student union, and Wayne Chan Ka-kui, convener of ""pro-independence"" alliance Students Independence Union, who jointly launched the siege of the Hong Kong police headquarters on June 26.Yeung was arrested the next day for allegedly assaulting police, after he led protesters to surround the gates of police headquarters. Just two days after his arrest, he jumped bail and escaped to Taiwan where he sought asylum.Yeung continued contact with secessionists in Hong Kong after he fled to Taipei, and he even organized several further riots on Telegram. Yeung allegedly ""guided"" his group members to storm the Legislative Council building on July 1 and steal hard drives from computers in the building, when he was already in hiding in Taipei, according to Wen Wei Po.Yeung and other secessionists have long been eyeing Taiwan as their escape route. Yeung had secretly visited Taiwan to meet with secessionists there in recent years, and had already paved his way to Taiwan.Cheng Wai-shing, who followed Yeung in several riots and even pretended to be a journalist to escape arrest, also went to Taiwan to seek political asylum although he was turned away in mid-July by Taiwanese authorities.After returning to Hong Kong, he continued to appear on the frontlines of several protests in a high-profile manner, which was expected to pave way for his reapplication for political asylum in Taipei.Brian Leung Kai-ping, who provoked the storming of Hong Kong's Legislative Council on July 1, fled to Taiwan the next morning.After the storming of the Legislative Council, several Hong Kong secessionists posted on social media that they could help those in need flee to Taiwan to ""stay away from trouble."" It's believed that more will seek help to flee Hong Kong.Taiwanese authorities call these asylum-seekers ""friends from Hong Kong,"" and said that related departments would deal with the situation based on ""humanity.""However, Taiwan is not the ultimate destination for these individuals, as they plan to urge the US to pass a so-called ""Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act,"" so that they can flee to the US eventually.Tung Chee-hwa, former Hong Kong Special Administration Region chief executive, said that there is reason to believe that Taiwan and the US are the masterminds behind the current Hong Kong disturbance, which escalated quickly and was well organized.Tung made the remarks during a luncheon organized by the Our Hong Kong Foundation on Wednesday.Tung said that foreign politicians and anti-China forces have been seeking to destroy the relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland, with the ultimate purpose of making Hong Kong a battleground for international games, a base against the central government and a pawn to contain China. He called on Hong Kong residents to remain reasonable and to draw a line between themselves and violence.Global Times "	8/2/19	0	0	-0.9903	-1

"DPP’s extreme policies hurting islandnA guide introduces the do's and don'ts in the Taiwan Island to two mainland tourists of the very first group of individual visitors who left from Shanghai on June 28, 2011. Photo: IC The Chinese mainland announced Wednesday that a pilot program allowing residents from 47 mainland cities to visit the island of Taiwan as individual tourists was set to be suspended starting August 1. The decision was made ""in view of the current cross-Straits relations,"" the mainland explained. The Taiwan island authority responded quickly, accusing the mainland of exerting pressure on the island and impacting people-to-people exchanges through politics.In the past three years, Tsai Ing-wen's authority has made no contribution to cross-Straits exchanges. Instead, suppressing and undermining such interactions has been the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)'s basic line.Aside from riding the US and Japan's coattails, the Tsai authority has launched a so-called New Southbound Policy, attempting to pull Taiwan away from the mainland by strengthening economic ties with ASEAN and Australia. ""De-Sinicization"" is an overt clamor raised by Tsai and her team.The Tsai authority's retrogression on cross-Straits relations has seriously undermined cross-Straits cooperation in various fields, including promoting mainland visitors' individual trips to Taiwan. Current cross-Straits cooperation relies mainly on previously existing projects. With an increasingly broken political foundation, whether these projects can continue is uncertain.Individual trip was opened up by the previous Taiwan authority. Almost 10 years after, individual tourists account for around 60 percent of mainland visitors to the island. If cross-Straits ties develop normally, such a travel mode would definitely propel a strong increase in mainland tourists to Taiwan.But the DPP authority has politicized mainland visitors in the past two years, considering their trips to Taiwan as the mainland's political and intelligence penetration. An increasing number of mainland tourists have been investigated and obstructed; some were even traced and monitored. As the island's ""presidential election"" approaches, it is highly possible that Taiwan secessionist forces will stir things up using mainland visitors.Mainland tourists have made up around 25 percent of Taiwan's inbound tourists and brought great wealth to the island. But public opinion controlled by the pro-secession camp, and the DPP authority itself, has never shown any gratitude. The DPP has constantly incited anti-mainland sentiment, largely infecting ordinary Taiwan people's attitudes toward mainland visitors. Complaints from mainland tourists about the unfriendly treatment they received in Taiwan have increased drastically.The mainland's decision to suspend the program demonstrates the government's responsibility for tourists' personal safety during the special period. Individual visitors are more prone to various attacks than those in tour groups. And they may fall into the trap set by Taiwan secessionist forces to undermine cross-Straits relations. Such preventive measures are quite necessary in the current situation.The program was launched to benefit local economy, but the island's attitude has made it meaningless. The Tsai authority needs to bear the consequences of its frantic political line.Suspending individual trips might cause inconvenience to some young people who planned to visit Taiwan. But we believe that people will understand the government's goodwill and sense of responsibility.The government's decision is meant to safeguard national interests and people's fundamental interests. It is a necessary response to DPP's extreme cross-Straits policy.Mainland tourists to the island are considered the epitome of cross-Straits exchanges. The DPP will cause Taiwan society to suffer losses by undermining such exchanges. This shows that the cross-Straits policies of Tsai and the DPP cannot be sustained long-term. "	8/1/19	0	0	-0.9473	-1
"Taiwan currying favor with US would only anger the Chinese mainlandnPhoto: Liu Xuanzun/GT China issued on July 24 a white paper on national defense, China's National Defense in the New Era. On the same day, the US military said that it sent a navy warship through the Taiwan Straits, which is the sixth such voyage in 2019. Some media outlets regarded the US sail as a response to the white paper on national defense.It cannot be ruled out that the US deliberately sent a warship through the straits on the day China's white paper was issued so as to flex military muscle. But it also might be a coincidence that the two events occurred on the same day. There is no need to overreact.US warships have crossed the Taiwan Straits about once a month in 2019. The message it conveys, such as containing China and supporting the island of Taiwan, is nothing new.Playing the Taiwan card has been a part of US policy toward China. Washington believes as long as it doesn't cross the red line of the one-China principle, Taiwan is the most effective card to provoke China without incurring a heavy cost.The US would like to act as an outside balancer, which is to maximize its self-interest at a minimum cost by sowing discord among countries in a certain region. Currently, on the East China Sea and the South China Sea issues, Washington doesn't have many leverages and can hardly find countries willing to confront China.Tokyo is easing ties with Beijing. The Philippines and Vietnam are unwilling to cooperate with the US to provoke China. Countries like Singapore have begun to gradually adjust their policies to strike a balance between China and the US.However, the situation in Taiwan is different.The Taiwan question concerns China's core interests. As cross-Straits ties have been strained, Taiwan's regional leader Tsai Ing-wen relies only on the US to confront the Chinese mainland, which has created space for the US to play tricks. Any trick played by the US would anger China. But the US believes that as long as it doesn't cross the red line, China will not resort to force or other drastic measures. Washington also believes that the Chinese mainland must take into consideration the sentiment of ordinary people on Taiwan island. If the Chinese mainland is too tough on Taiwan, it may in turn help Tsai to win reelection.That being said, Washington is convinced that stirring up trouble on the Taiwan question is the best way to contain China. Supporting Taiwan authorities against the Chinese mainland through diverse means has been a US strategy. As long as US President Donald Trump is in office and Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party is ruling the island, Washington will continue to play the Taiwan card.In comparison to China's white papers on national defense issued in 2013 and 2015, the latest one devotes more text to show the mainland's position toward the island of Taiwan, using harsher language.This change is determined by the current situation of the Taiwan Straits and China-US ties.In both 2013 and 2015, Ma Ying-jeou served as the regional leader of Taiwan. During his tenure, cross-Straits relations had been improving, with frequent interactions and cooperation across the straits.The current situation is totally different. Tsai has been working with the US against the Chinese mainland, refusing reunification and pursuing Taiwan independence. In the 2020 Taiwan regional leadership election campaign, Tsai will definitely play the card of ""Taiwan's sovereignty"" and step up the strained cross-Straits relationship so as to gain more votes.Now that both China-US relations and cross-Straits ties are regressing, observers predict they will deteriorate further.The Chinese mainland's attitude toward Taiwan should thus not be the same as it was in 2013 and 2015. The Taiwan question is facing more urgent and graver challenges. By issuing the latest white paper on national defense, the Chinese mainland took a clear and firm stance toward Taiwan.The author is deputy director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	8/1/19	0	0	0.9915	1
"Taiwan travel industry in doom and gloom at losing mainland touristsnTourists stand in front of a store in Taiwan. File photo: IC A pilot program that allowed residents from 47 cities on the Chinese mainland to visit Taiwan as individual tourists was suspended from Thursday. Industry insiders said the travel industry in Taiwan will suffer huge losses as a result.The decision was made in light of current cross-Straits relations, said the mainland-based Association for Tourism Exchange across the Taiwan Straits, according to the notice by the association that was posted on the website of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.""The move will cause huge losses to the travel industry in the island of Taiwan, which is 40 percent dependent on the mainland, using a conservative estimation,"" an industry insider told the Global Times on Thursday on condition of anonymity. ""In terms of proportion, individual tourists and group tourists are half and half.""The pilot program was launched in 2011 as a positive measure to expand exchanges across the Taiwan Straits in the context of the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, said Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, during a press conference on Thursday.""The actions of the Democratic Progressive Party, which promotes Taiwan secession, incites hostility toward the mainland and provokes confrontation between the two sides and has seriously undermined the basis of the trial run,"" said Ma.Some 2.7 million mainland tourists visited Taiwan in 2018, the lowest number in six years, according to the office of transportation and communications of Taiwan. Shops across Taiwan Province have seen a sharp drop in revenue since 2016 as a result of fewer mainland tourists, and many full-time tour guides have switched to other businesses, Taiwan media outlets have reported.After the notice, some travel agencies have stopped to offer individual travel services to Taiwan. Global Times reporter on Thursday found that travel platforms such as CAISSA Tourism Group's website has shown no results when consumers search individual travels to Taiwan.""Tourist numbers will continue decreasing and local Taiwan GDP could drop 0.2-0.3 percentage points because of the reduced mainland tourists,"" said the insider. ""Not only travel agencies will struggle, but also related industries such as airlines, catering services and the lodging industry.""""Customers are angry about DPP leader Tsai Ing-wen's purchase of US arms using money from mainland tourists and they have been demanding refunds of airplane tickets and accommodation costs,"" a salesperson surnamed Su from Beijing-based Heping World International Travel Service told the Global Times on Thursday. ""After the notice, almost all individual travelers decided not to visit Taiwan, even in travel groups, which have not been suspended.""""I just arrived in Taiwan today and I already heard people complaining 'business is going to die',"" Xue Qingde, a Taiwan businessman who has been investing in the Chinese mainland, told the Global Times on Thursday.""Yes, we do have mounting concerns over the reduced travelers from the Chinese mainland because half of our customers traveled as individual tourists,"" an employee of the Taipei-based travel agency South East Travel Service Corp told the Global Times on Thursday.""We have seen the notice and we are closely observing the impact,"" a staff at another agency, Right One Travel, based in Taipei told the Global Times on Thursday.

"Revised high-school history books highlight territorial integritynA teacher arranges books at a classroom at Jianshan Middle School in Chongqing, southwest China, Aug. 29, 2017. (Xinhua/Qin Tingfu) Revised Chinese high-school history textbooks for this year's fall semester highlight national sovereignty, territorial integrity and ethnic unity, as the textbooks more clearly state that the regions, including the Diaoyu Islands, South China Sea, Xinjiang , Tibet and Taiwan, have been part of China since ancient times.The history of China as a united multi-nationality country has been underlined in the new textbooks, and the content of the administration of successive dynasties over border areas, including the Diaoyu Islands, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Tibet Autonomous Region, South China Sea and Taiwan, has been strengthened, Ye Xiaobing, a history professor at Capital Normal University and director of the History Teaching Professional Commission of the Chinese Society of Education who participated in publishing the high-school history textbooks, told the Global Times on Thursday.For example, the new history textbooks for junior high-school students state that the Diaoyu Islands and South China Sea have been Chinese territory since ancient times, and China first discovered, named and operated those regions, Ye said.China began long-term jurisdiction over the Diaoyu Islands and their affiliated islands since the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), and those islands have been included in Chinese maps since then. Since the Western Han Dynasty (206BC-AD25), the ancient Chinese people sailed and discovered the South China Sea islands.""Highlighting such content aims to strengthen education on national security and territorial integrity to high-school students to help them form a correct historical cognition and build national and cultural identity,"" Ye said.The new history textbooks will be distributed and used by all high schools in the Chinese mainland starting September, according to Ye.People's Education Press, the main publisher of national textbooks, and the Xinhua Bookstore in Beijing told the Global Times that the new history textbooks will be available by the end of this month.The new history textbooks were prepared amid secession movements in Hong Kong and the island of Taiwan. Observers believe that strengthening national territory and unity education is significant at the moment for young people in the Chinese mainland to further strengthen their patriotism and concept of national unity.The Ministry of Education (MOE) published the list of Chinese language, history and politics textbooks for junior and senior high schools in May and July, respectively, and said that textbooks on the three subjects in primary, junior high and senior high schools in the Chinese mainland use national textbooks, its website said.A new guideline to improve the quality of compulsory education from the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and State Council in July said compulsory education - six years primary and three years secondary - should cultivate the students' core socialist values, traditional Chinese culture and mental health. Schools should strengthen education in patriotism, collectivism and socialism, and guide children and teenagers to follow the Party.Senior high-school textbooks were also revised. The MOE has revised textbooks on politics, Chinese and history as of June, the MOE website said. "	8/1/19	0	0	0.9919	1
"How will mainland stars meet their Taiwan lovers after travel suspension?nChinese mainland fans are hotly discussing on social media how dating star couples, comprised of one from the mainland and the other from the island of Taiwan, will meet after mainland authorities temporarily suspended issuing travel permits for individual mainland travelers to go to the island.On Sina Weibo, a topic hashtag ""How can Li Ronghao go to Taiwan"" has been generating some amusingly funny posts.Li, a mainland singer, made a high-profile proposal to Taiwan singer Rainie Yang on July 11, but they are not yet married.""Book a group tour,"" wrote a netizen, noting that tourists are still able to travel to Taiwan when they travel as a group.""But what if the tour guide insists Li visit Taipei 101?"" another replied suggesting that Li isn't likely interested in visiting typical tourist attractions like Taipei's tallest building.A pilot program allowing residents of 47 Chinese mainland cities to travel to the island of Taiwan on individual trips was suspended starting Thursday due to ""the current cross-Straits ties.""However, group tours and married couples are not affected by the ban on individual travel to Taiwan, leading some commentators online to give Li and Yang advice to marry as soon as possible.Not understanding that the travel restrictions don't applied to married couples, netizens also came up with travel suggestions for Wang Xiaofei and Barbie Hsu, Chen Xiao and Michelle Chen, and Nicky Wu and Liu Shishi.""Let Chen Xiao and Li Ronghao book a group tour and then have Wang Xiaofei and Liu Shishi join them. They can fill out their tourist group with their agents,"" a Weibo user wrote. "	8/1/19	0	0	-0.0979	-1

It is not known if the two military activities mentioned by the Maritime Safety Administration are related to the drill announced earlier by the Defense Ministry.Experts previously told the Global Times that the drills announced by the Defense Ministry are expected to be big, involve all military branches of the PLA, and serve as a warning to Taiwan secessionists.

"Taiwan's Cloud Gate dance group stages outdoor performancenThe Cloud Gate, Taiwan's first modern dance group, staged an outdoor performance for the public on Saturday evening in downtown Taipei, attracting around 40,000 audience members who sat on the ground in a public square. The performance, an annual July event since 1996 with support from Cathay Financial Holdings, is the 24th of its kind and the 2,432nd of all the performances staged by the group. It is also the final outdoor public performance to be headed by group founder and choreographer Lin Hwai-min before he retires as the group's artistic director at the end of the year. Dancers presented selected works of Lin at the show with rich and expressive body language, with their inclusion of Chinese martial arts-style moves winning wide applause. Lin also arranged for other performers who are about to leave the group to perform their signature dances as a tribute to their contributions over the years. In his speech delivered before the show began, Lin said he has been working hard to choreograph dances that can hold the audience's gaze, because otherwise they tend to move around during outdoor performances. ""You could say that my choreography has been formed by outdoor performance audiences,"" he said. The Cloud Gate group was founded by Lin in 1973, the first of its kind in Taiwan. Cloud Gate dancers are trained in meditation, martial arts, modern dance, ballet and more, according to the group. The group has won a number of international prizes and it tours extensively around the world. "	7/28/19	0	0	0.9814	1

"Come what may, reunification of Taiwan with mainland is the goalnPhoto: Xinhua Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at a ceremony commemorating the 40th anniversary of issuing Message to Compatriots in Taiwan at the start of 2019. In his speech, Xi proposed exploring the ""two systems"" formula for Taiwan island and enriching peaceful reunification.The principle is centered on the idea that only a ""two systems"" can be explored. A ""one country"" solution is not included.The principle of ""one country"" concerns sovereignty, which is not negotiable. There is only one China in the world. Taiwan is part of it. Historical and legal facts cannot be changed by any person or force. The flexibility aspect involves the premise of how ""one country"" provides a platform for dialogue on a ""two systems"" plan that fits with Taiwan public opinion and provides benefits to the compatriots.In the past, some Taiwanese have challenged the principle of one country, two systems. Some of them have opposed the concept of ""one country."" Some are utilizing their opposition against one country, two systems principle as a tool to win more votes and shape Taiwan public opinion. Both are intolerable.For those against one country, two systems principle, what are they opposing? Is it one country or two systems? If they can't accept one country, then there's nothing to negotiate as reunification is inevitable.There are many paths to reunification, and a peaceful one is the best. Yet if Taiwan is unwilling to unite with the Chinese mainland in a peaceful manner, resorting to force would be the only option. Both options aim at the same goal - reunification of Taiwan with the Chinese mainland.Likewise, one country is the core of one country, two systems. It can only be one country regardless of how many systems in it. If Taiwan cannot accept two systems, then China should try to move forward with ""one system"" plan - implementing socialism in Taiwan after reunification. This would be an easy task for the mainland, where socialism has been successful and recognized worldwide.The one country, two systems principle proposed by former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, is a courageous innovation and exploration of the state system. The principle shows the mainland's most significant goodwill and sincere gesture to Taiwan compatriots. It is a principle to maximize their interests.What choices would Taiwan have if it gave up on the one country, two systems? Either it becomes a foreign country's vassal state or colony, or it the only other option - accepting one country, one system. There is no third choice. With a strong Chinese mainland in place, Taiwan independence is a path that leads to nowhere.The principle of one country, two systems was initially aimed at the Taiwan question, but was first implemented in Hong Kong. After decades of exploration, the conclusion has been reached that one country is a prerequisite to reach the final goal.It would be unnecessary to overly stress two systems and ignore one country. For reunification, we must strengthen education on national consciousness among the younger generations in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao. Born in Chinese territory, they should not think about independence and separatism.Colonization should be eliminated in Hong Kong, and the Taiwan independence forces should be eliminated in the island. The Chinese mainland will respect public opinions. However, where reunification is concerned, the general opinion of all Chinese will be respected, instead of only a few regional opinions.We should stand by forces that support reunification. We should support them morally and through policies and funding. We should not allow these people to incur losses nor live in fear to voice their opinions. Otherwise, there would be fewer people supporting reunification. Without a public opinion foundation for reunification, how could it be realized?The US is trying to strengthen its bond with Taiwan. Washington recently agreed to sell weapons to Taiwan, a clear violation of the China-US joint communiqué signed on August 17, 1982.The resolution of Taiwan question has been delayed for seven decades. How much longer can this continue? Taiwan's veterans who were forced to leave their homeland are now in their twilight years. They should return when they still have a chance. It is time to shoulder historical responsibilities.China sincerely hopes that for all of those who possess noble aspirations in Taiwan and the mainland can work together, voice their positions, and wave the reunification flag.If Taiwan independence separatists behave openly and wantonly, then what is wrong with promoting reunification? Personal gains and losses are temporary. National reunification is the eternal lasting enterprise.The author is vice president of the China Strategy Culture Promotion Association. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	7/23/19	0	0	0.9929	1

"Pop star fans fight online popularity competitionnJay Chou Photo: CFP The difference between social media celebrities and traditional stars became a hot topic last weekend as singer Jay Chou from the island of Taiwan soared to the top of discussions on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo.Through nearly 75 million credits and more than 3 million followers, Chou overtook idol Cai Xukun on Sunday morning after a fierce 16-hour online popularity battle among fans. Cai mustered 5.6 million credits and 4.5 million followers.The hashtag ""Jay Chou fans are pushed to do business"" was viewed 1.8 billion times.The contest started from July 16 when an internet user asked on Chinese media review site Douban why it was so difficult to buy concert tickets to Chou when it seemed he was not so popular on Weibo.This provoked a contest between traditional singers who attract fans with products and social media celebrities who first gather online attention then use it to cash in.Some Chou fans said that the reason they devoted so much to the campaign was to show younger fans that social media did not mean everything.The online data on singers and actors with proper professional performance skills is possibly not so good on social media, analysts said, but the popularity they earned among the public with excellent products was not available to online celebrities who rely on fans to fake data on Weibo.

"Mainland sea bridge built with hope of linking TaiwannPicture of Pingtan cross-strait road-rail bridge. Photo: VCG A cross-sea bridge from East China's Fujian Province was completely connected on Wednesday after the last phase of concrete pouring, moving Chinese mainland infrastructure a step closer to linking with the island of Taiwan.The bridge in East China's Fujian Province is regarded as a vital route which in the future might link the island of Taiwan via the Beijing-Taipei expressway, the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council said on Sina Weibo on Wednesday.In a short video released by the commission, a construction worker from the China Railway Construction Corporation Limited who participated in the project said, ""I firmly believe this bridge will link Taiwan eventually. As an infrastructure worker, I'm ready! Taiwan will be reunited.""The bridge has a six-lane expressway on top and at the bottom a railway for bullet trains traveling as fast as 200 kilometers per hour.The 16.34 kilometer bridge connects Pingtan Island and four nearby islets to the mainland and is expected to be open to traffic by the second half of next year, the Xinhua News Agency reported.The bridge will shorten the route from Fuzhou, capital of Fujian, to Pingtan - an island about 126 kilometers from Taiwan and the Chinese mainland's nearest location. People can take a boat or plane from Pingtan to Taiwan.The bridge could be an important venue in the future that helps link his home with the mainland, Cheng Po-yu, 32, from Taiwan, who works in Beijing, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Picturing a future where people could drive from Taiwan to the Chinese mainland, Cheng said, ""Driving to the Chinese mainland is a totally different experience from flying. That time will mean a true integration of people from across the Straits.""In March, Wu Zhiming, chairman of Fujian provincial Party committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, suggested that a submarine tunnel from Pingtan to Taiwan could boost business and cultural relations.It could also act as a deterrent to secessionists on the island, Wu said.

Photo: VCG A cross-sea bridge from East China's Fujian Province was completely connected on Wednesday after the last phase of concrete pouring, moving Chinese mainland infrastructure a step closer to linking with the island of Taiwan.The bridge in East China's Fujian Province is regarded as a vital route which in the future might link the island of Taiwan via the Beijing-Taipei expressway, the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council said on Sina Weibo on Wednesday.In a short video released by the commission, a construction worker from the China Railway Construction Corporation Limited who participated in the project said, ""I firmly believe this bridge will link Taiwan eventually. As an infrastructure worker, I'm ready! Taiwan will be reunited.""The bridge has a six-lane expressway on top and at the bottom a railway for bullet trains traveling as fast as 200 kilometers per hour.The 16.34 kilometer bridge connects Pingtan Island and four nearby islets to the mainland and is expected to be open to traffic by the second half of next year, the Xinhua News Agency reported.The bridge will shorten the route from Fuzhou, capital of Fujian, to Pingtan - an island about 126 kilometers from Taiwan and the Chinese mainland's nearest location. People can take a boat or plane from Pingtan to Taiwan.The bridge could be an important venue in the future that helps link his home with the mainland, Cheng Po-yu, 32, from Taiwan, who works in Beijing, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Picturing a future where people could drive from Taiwan to the Chinese mainland, Cheng said, ""Driving to the Chinese mainland is a totally different experience from flying. That time will mean a true integration of people from across the Straits.""In March, Wu Zhiming, chairman of Fujian provincial Party committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, suggested that a submarine tunnel from Pingtan to Taiwan could boost business and cultural relations.It could also act as a deterrent to secessionists on the island, Wu said.

"China’s sanctions to show teeth to US firmsnPhoto: IC The Chinese foreign ministry said on Friday that China will impose sanctions on US firms selling weapons to the island of Taiwan. The announcement made a splash in the US. A US State Department spokesperson said on Monday it will ""closely monitor any actions that would unfairly disadvantage US firms"" while tried to find excuses for the arms sale to the island.Although China hasn't released details of sanctions, the US feels the pressure. According to VOA Chinese, US Representative Ted Yoho said in the past 40 years US presidents have approved 86 arms sales to the island of Taiwan, implying that China should get used to that and not overreact. However, what's wrong is wrong. The world has no reason to adapt to wrongness.The third joint communiqué between China and the US signed on August 17, 1982 demanded the US to gradually reduce its arms sales to Taiwan until the issue is completely resolved.But Washington violated the communiqué by repeatedly expanding its arms sales to the island. This has had a destructive impact on cross-Straits peace.If the US insists on doing so, the Chinese mainland is destined to adopt increasingly resolute countermeasures against it.The US attaches more importance to China's recently announced sanctions on US firms selling arms to the island of Taiwan than before, because China is growing stronger. We are more capable of safeguarding our national interests and launching precise counterattacks on entities that harm China's interests and national security.We are no longer in the era in which only the US can impose sanctions on Chinese enterprises but not vice versa. China announced on May 31 the establishment of an ""Unreliable Entity List"" to prevent China's interests from being jeopardized by US firms. Regardless of how much we can punish relevant US companies, China has made itself clear and heard. The game between China and US is now bilateral rather than unilateral.US weapons companies that participate in arms sales to Taiwan have to pay the price, now or later. They have reaped handsome profits by selling outdated but overpriced equipment to Taiwan. These weapons dealers have become the major promoter, as well as biggest beneficiary of US arms sales to Taiwan.Some Chinese doubt the effect of sanctioning US weapons companies, but the actual result may not be what they think.The four US arms companies involved this time can't turn a blind eye to the Chinese market. For example, General Dynamics owns the world's largest business jet maker - Gulfstream Aerospace - of which China is the third largest market. Aircraft rescue and fire fighting vehicles produced by Oshkosh Corporation are used in more than 60 airports in China.Sanctioning US companies that undermine China's national interests will serve as a warning to other American companies which may do the same thing. In the long run, individuals who harm China's interests and cross the legal redline could also be the target of China's sanctions. These people should take note. "	7/16/19	0	0	-0.8658	-1

"Desperate Taiwan leader clutches at US straw amid a struggling economynPhoto: AP Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen kick-started her four-country visit to the Caribbean on July 11 with a transit stop in New York on the first leg and another in Denver on her way back. It has been reported that Tsai would spend four nights in the US. For the Tsai authority, visiting Taiwan's ""allies"" is not the purpose of the trip, a decent stopover in the US is. Tsai has confirmed she will run for Taiwan's top leader in 2020. What matters the most to her is the reception she received on her transit stops in the US and the level of US support she could garner. For the three years Tsai has been in office, Taiwan has made little progress in improving living standards. All Tsai and her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) can do is to play the security and diplomatic ""cards."" However, the less said about her diplomatic achievements the better. Given Tsai's refusal to agree to the 1992 Consensus, the basis of cross-Straits political engagement has been lost and Taiwan can no longer keep its observer status at annual World Health Assembly (WHA) events now. Now only 17 countries have diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Forced by the current predicament, Tsai is making more efforts to cozy up to the US, hoping to showcase her accomplishments through the so-called progress in ties with the White House. Unfortunately, although the Tsai authority has been consistently cooperating with Washington and opening its coffers wide to purchase US arms, Washington treats the island only as a pawn and tends to make empty promises. Washington is incapable of helping Taiwan arrest flagging support from allies as their number keeps decreasing. When it comes to economic and trade issues, the US refuses to make any compromise with the island of Taiwan. According to a March article in Taipei Times, ""Taiwan's restrictions on imports of pork and beef from the United States remain a major barrier to trade between the two sides."" It also noted, ""Taiwan has not followed international standards or a bilateral protocol with the US on the issue of American meat imports."" The US Commerce Department said on July 2 that it would impose duties of up to 456 percent on certain steel produced in South Korea or the island of Taiwan that is then shipped to Vietnam for minor processing and finally exported to the US. Ironically, Chen Ming-tong, ""head"" of the Mainland Affairs Council of Taiwan, delivered a speech on the same day at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, saying that deepening Taiwan-US relations provide solid backing for cross-Straits peace. Moreover, people of Taiwan are not interested in Tsai's diplomatic approach. Some Taiwan media outlets said every visit of Tsai to ""allies"" is extremely expensive and brings little benefit. To maintain ""diplomatic relations"" with Panama, Taiwan has paid huge amounts of money to the country. Yet Panama snapped ties with the island in 2017. Currently, Taiwan people are more concerned about the economy and their living standards as well as the improvement of cross-Straits relations, rather than the closeness between the island of Taiwan and the US, which the Tsai authority often brags about. Taiwan had experienced rapid economic development in the last century and was once called one of Asia's four little dragons. But in the 21st century, the island's economic growth has been continuously decelerating. Worse, wages of its people, especially the youths, have stagnated. The real average monthly salary of employees in Taiwan's industrial and services sectors in 2018 was even below that in 2001. Instead of ""stopover diplomacy"" in the US, policymakers in Taiwan should concentrate on resolving the island's economic issues and improving living standards. They should adopt a proactive approach to cross-Straits ties so as to seek more opportunities for Taiwan's development rather than creating confrontation across the Straits in pursuit of their own interests.

Photo: Xinhua Firm opposition RELATED ARTICLES: US arms sale card endangers Taiwan The US is deploying a double standard by calling China's proposed sanctions on US companies for arms sales to Taiwan a ""foolish action,"" Chinese mainland analysts said on Sunday, pointing out that the sanctions could not only cut base material supply to these companies including rare earths but also block their non-military products from entering Chinese markets.After the US government approved a plan to sell $2.22 billion worth of arms to Taiwan, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang announced at a routine press briefing on Friday that to safeguard national interests, China would impose sanctions on US enterprises participating in the sales.Citing data released by the US Department of Defense, Chinese state-owned media identified these firms as Raytheon that provides Stinger missiles, General Dynamics that provides M1A2T tanks, and BAE and Oshkosh that provide tanks equipment.US Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told media that it was a foolish action as the companies that would possibly be sanctioned were not very much going to be engaged in defense industry sales to China, according to a short video VOA Chinese posted on its Twitter account on Sunday.In response, Xu Guangyu, a senior consultant at the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told the Global Times on Sunday that these US arms companies seem to not have an arms trade connection with China, but this is just in terms of final product.A final product is based on many components built by a whole industrial chain in which China plays important roles, Xu said, noting that China could freeze the industrial chains related to these companies, or stop providing certain base materials.Rare earths, the industry which is largely controlled by China, are imperative in making advanced weapons and equipment. For instance, the M1A2 tank of General Dynamics uses samarium-cobalt in its navigation system, according to a UK-based Daily Telegraph report in 2011.The US Department of Defense is assessing the US rare earths capability to secure a stable supply amid the country's trade conflict with China, Reuters reported on Saturday.Industry insiders warned that these companies' non-military businesses could also be affected. General Dynamics is not only the manufacturer of the M1A2 tank, but also the parent company of Gulfstream, an aircraft company whose private jets are reportedly favored by Chinese billionaires.Gulfstream is the earliest foreign business jet-maker that entered the Chinese market decades ago and certain types of its jets such as the Gulfstream G650 are now popular among China's wealthiest, a senior executive of a Beijing-based business aviation integrated service provider told the Global Times. He asked not to be fully named.A business jet is priced between $20 million and $70 million, he said, which means that losing the Chinese market could strike a huge blow to the US company.Industry insiders said that one of the punitive measures could be ordering Chinese banks and financial institutions to reject loans to transactions related to Gulfstream, as almost all business jets are sold via a mortgage financing model.Gulfstream's Chinese clients include the founder of Alibaba Jack Ma Yun and Wanda Chairman Wang Jianlin, media reported.The website of General Dynamics China branch became inaccessible on Sunday.""US arms sales to Taiwan constitute a serious violation of international law and the basic norms governing international relations. This is a serious violation of the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiqués,"" Geng said on Friday.He also expressed China's opposition to Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen's transit in the US, urging the US side to cancel arms sales immediately and stop the official exchange with Taiwan.Chinese mainland analysts stressed that the decision to launch sanctions underlined China's firm opposition to arms sales to Taiwan.The simplest measure to punish these companies was to ban their business in China, Shi Yinhong, director of Renmin University of China's Center for American Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday.Lessons could also be drawn from precedent. On December 17, 2015, then foreign ministry spokesperson Hong Lei announced that neither Chinese governments nor Chinese enterprises would cooperate with companies involved in US arms sales to Taiwan. Companies involved at that time were Raytheon and Lockheed Martin.Apart from sanctions, some Taiwan media is also interpreting an exercise by the People's Liberation Army near the southeast coast as the Chinese mainland's expression of opposition to arms sales.The Chinese Ministry of National Defense said in a statement Sunday that the exercise was part of their regular arrangement according to the annual schedule.By criticizing China's sanctions on US arms firms as foolish action, the US is obviously applying a double standard as the US has imposed sanctions on China that are even more useless and stupid, the analysts said.In September 2018, the US imposed sanctions on China's Equipment Development Department, the military branch responsible for weapons and equipment, and its director, Li Shangfu, for buying Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 surface-to-air missile system from Russia, claiming this was against a US sanctions law punishing Russian government for meddling in the 2016 US election , Reuters reported.

The People's Liberation Army (PLA) air force conducted patrol training over China's island of Taiwan on Friday. Su-35 fighter jets flew over the Bashi Channel in formation with the H-6Ks for the first time, which marks a new breakthrough in island patrol patterns, said Shen Jinke, spokesperson for the PLA air force. Photo: Xinhua The latest US approval of arms sales to the island of Taiwan will hurt delicate China-US relations at a sensitive time when China and the US are to resume trade talks, and Taiwan secessionists should know that they are only being used as a card by the US, Chinese experts warned Tuesday.Even if the island acquires US weapons, the Chinese mainland still has an overwhelming advantage over the island in military strength, and Taiwan secessionists should not expect US protection in case of a military conflict, they stressed.At a routine press conference on Tuesday, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang urged the US side to immediately cancel the plan to sell arms to Taiwan and end its military links with the island, before it causes more harm to China-US ties and the peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.The US arms sales to Taiwan severely violate international law, the basic norms governing international relations, the one-China principle, the three China-US joint communiqués and interfere in China's internal affairs, undermining China's sovereignty and security interests, Geng said.""The Chinese side is strongly dissatisfied with and firmly opposed to the US plan to sell arms to Taiwan. We have lodged stern representations with the US side on this,"" Geng said.The US should immediately withdraw its arms sales to Taiwan and stop sending the wrong signals to ""Taiwan independence"" separatists, the Chinese mainland's Taiwan Affairs Office said on Tuesday.The US State Department approved a possible $2.2 billion arms sale to the island of Taiwan. The potential sale includes 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks, plus related equipment, and 250 Stinger missiles, CNN reported on Tuesday.The tanks are worth about $2 billion, and the portable surface-to-air missiles cost $223 million, CNN reported.Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump agreed on June 29 to restart trade consultations on the sidelines of the G20 Osaka summit, after a yearlong trade war between the world's two largest economies.""The arms sale approval shows the US is increasingly disregarding China-US relations… The US is adjusting its China policies toward confrontation on all fronts,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University's Institute of International Relations in Beijing, told the Global Times.In the first Taiwan arms sale deal under Trump's presidency, the US went ahead with a $1.42 billion arms sale to the island of Taiwan involving missiles and torpedoes in June 2017.The US then sold $330 million worth of spare parts for warplanes in September 2018 and a $500 million package in April involving pilot training.The latest deal is the biggest in sum, and China should realize that the US will unlikely stop such sales anytime soon, which is bad for China-US relations and cross-Straits relations, Li said, noting that arms sales to the Taiwan region have been used by Washington since it established diplomatic relations with Beijing.Taiwan also applied for 66 F-16V fighter jets at the recommendation of the US in February, but the deal was put on hold due to tensions between China and the US, Taiwan News reported.""If the US continuously sells weapons to the Taiwan region, it would wrongly encourage Taiwan secessionists to further misjudge the situation and may eventually lead to military confrontations. This will hurt everyone's interests,"" Li said.At a gathering marking the 40th anniversary of the issuance of the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan in January, Xi pledged ""utmost sincerity and greatest efforts"" for the prospect of peaceful reunification, but he made no promise to renounce the use of force. A US-made F-16V fighter jet takes off from the freeway in Changhua county, Taiwan, as a crowd takes photos during the annual Han Kuang drill on May 28, 2019. Photo: AFP Military experts said the Chinese mainland military enjoys overwhelming superiority to the island's, even if Taiwan gets US weapons.The People's Liberation Army, which retains ""liberation"" in its name, has developed rapidly in the past years with certain weapons and equipment able to rival the US' ones; and it could simply outnumber Taiwan troops, a mainland military expert, who asked not to be named, told the Global Times.The arms sale also received a negative reception within the island, as some netizens there said the island's authorities should spend the $2.2 billion on economic development.Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen ""used our tax money [for useless things],"" read a comment.""A Stinger missile costs $38,000, and the US is selling it for $900,000."" ""That is more than 20 times more expensive. Isn't that bad business?"" another posted.The M1A2 tanks are also not suitable for Taiwan. Wei Dongxu, a Beijing military analyst, said that the 60-ton tank, although technologically advanced, is too heavy for an island like Taiwan that has a dense river network and weak roads.To counter a potential mainland amphibious landing, Taiwan could only deploy the tanks on shores, but this will only make them targets for mainland missiles, Wei said.""The potential weapon purchase is merely the island's attempt to pay more protection money to the US. However, this will not save Taiwan secessionists,"" Wei said.China and the US are stuck in a trade war and the US is playing all kinds of cards to create trouble and pressure China. Taiwan is one of them and nothing more, analysts said.The US is using Taiwan secessionists to obtain its own interests, Li said, noting that the secessionists do not care about China-US relations, so they could take the US bait and risk it all.But the US will only let the people of Taiwan suffer the consequences if the risk spirals out of control, Li noted.Wei said that the arms sale could give secessionists in the island an illusion of US support, but the US military will by no means fight for Taiwan, especially against an opponent as powerful and determined as China.China and the US, the two largest economies in the world, are playing a game, and while China sees the island of Taiwan as an inalienable part of itself, the US only sees it as a pawn, analysts stressed.

"Tsai plays puppet of US in NY stopovernPhoto: AFP RELATED ARTICLES: US arms sale card endangers Taiwan During her trip to Caribbean countries, Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen on Thursday made her first stopover in New York since assuming office. Tsai and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) are feeling ecstatic. She became the third Taiwan ""president"" to have stopped over in New York, following similar trips by former leaders Chen Shui-bian and Ma Ying-jeou.But Tsai sees fewer restrictions on her activities in New York, which include meeting UN ambassadors from Taiwan's ""allies."" The pro-independence Green camp on the island calls it a ""major diplomatic breakthrough.""Leaders of the Taiwan region often visit their ""allies"" in the Caribbean, yet their real aim is to get to stop over in the US. The US is using Taiwan as a card against the Chinese mainland. The arrangement over the location and treatment of Taiwan regional leaders' stopover has become a US tactic to play the card. Allowing Tsai to make a transit stop in the US and enhance her profile there is by far the highest-level stopover the US has provided to leaders from the island. Obviously, this is related to the China-US trade war.It can be assumed that Washington has prepared an even worse ruse to play the Taiwan card - making arrangements for the Taiwan regional leader to stop over in Washington DC. If so, and if public activities are also allowed during the stopover, it will be nothing short of an official visit to the US. But the uncertainty over how the US receives the Taiwan regional leader is restricted by the uncertainty over how Beijing would react to US moves. Tsai is nothing more than a puppet controlled by Washington.The US is becoming increasingly proactive in playing the Taiwan card, which shows that Washington is struggling with Beijing. Thus, it needs to make use of the most sensitive issue in China-US ties. On the other hand, China's strength has been growing substantially and the range of its major power games with the US is getting wider. The strategic influence of the Taiwan card is waning.In the face of Tsai's performance in the US and the latter's tricks to utilize the event, the Chinese people do not see an overwhelming crisis, but tend to think low of the US and Taiwan.China's strategic confidence over the Taiwan Straits has been boosted. China adheres to the policy of peaceful reunification, but its strong military has reinforced the stateliness of its peaceful policy.The Chinese mainland's bottom line is that Taiwan must never try to promote de jure independence. If the collusion between the US and Taiwan goes too far, the Chinese mainland might adjust its Taiwan policy. If the DPP administration's tactics keep snowballing, military strikes will be carried out by the mainland sooner or later. Pro-independence forces in Taiwan should hope the mainland withdraws its deterrence against Taiwan, rather than continue to show off its closeness to the US. "	7/12/19	0	0	0.9439	1

"US arms sale card endangers Taiwan if line crossednPentagon said on Monday that the country has approved arms sales worth $2.2 billion to Taiwan, including 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles. When US media reported the story, they said the plan was approved ""amid trade tensions with Beijing.""It is the fourth arm sale to Taiwan by the administration of US President Donald Trump in the past two years. Compared to previous US administrations, the $2.2 billion deal is neither too big nor too small, yet bigger than three previous arms sales by the Trump administration to Taiwan, indicating an upward trend.US arms sales to Taiwan were once restricted by the August 17 Communique signed in 1982, which stipulates that Washington must gradually reduce its arms sales to Taiwan until the issue was fundamentally resolved. But the US later turned its back on the commitment.The Chinese mainland must depend on itself to resolve the issue of US arms sales to Taiwan. The Chinese mainland's military power is getting strong enough to make Taiwan's newly purchased weapons of no military significance. The island's meager military spending is no longer capable of providing a military balance across the Straits.Moreover, the Chinese mainland's enhanced strength enables us to use more leverages to suppress external arms sales to the island.The US has several goals in selling weapons to Taiwan - make money, maintain US influence on the island and contain the Chinese mainland. Washington is aware that arms sales have long been meaningless for helping maintain military balance across the Taiwan Straits. But the focus of US policy has shifted from defending Taiwan's security to a power game with China.Maintaining ties with the US is the basis of Taiwan authorities' cross-Straits policies. They are aware that the People's Liberation Army has an overwhelming advantage over Taiwan's military. If the Chinese mainland decides to liberate the island, it would be easier than the liberation of Beiping in 1949. What Taiwan wants now is a psychological effect by declaring its close relationship with the US. But cutting a large slice of Taiwan's military spending to US arms dealers is like kowtowing to the US and paying the US for protection.The Chinese mainland increasingly dominates the cross-Straits situation while exercising restraint. But it has the capability to change the rules of the game across the Straits.The US and Taiwan must not step out of line; otherwise, a price must be paid. We might as well make a bold assumption. If an arms sale between the US and Taiwan is not acceptable to the Chinese mainland, if the latter announces it would resolutely destroy the equipment once they are placed on the island, what would happen?It is without question that Taiwan will be the first to flinch, because even if the Chinese mainland and the US can withstand a clash in the Straits, Taiwan will find it unbearable.Taiwan's security depends on how it deals with cross-Straits relations and avoids military confrontation with the mainland. The Chinese mainland has been adhering to the policy of peaceful reunification. Taiwan authorities should not force the mainland to abandon such a policy. "	7/9/19	0	0	0.9361	1

Photo: Xinhua The latest US approval of arms sales to the island of Taiwan will hurt delicate China-US relations at a sensitive time when China and the US are to resume trade talks, and Taiwan secessionists should know that they are only being used as a card by the US, Chinese experts warned Tuesday.Even if the island acquires US weapons, the Chinese mainland still has an overwhelming advantage over the island in military strength, and Taiwan secessionists should not expect US protection in case of a military conflict, they stressed.At a routine press conference on Tuesday, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang urged the US side to immediately cancel the plan to sell arms to Taiwan and end its military links with the island, before it causes more harm to China-US ties and the peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.The US arms sales to Taiwan severely violate international law, the basic norms governing international relations, the one-China principle, the three China-US joint communiqués and interfere in China's internal affairs, undermining China's sovereignty and security interests, Geng said.""The Chinese side is strongly dissatisfied with and firmly opposed to the US plan to sell arms to Taiwan. We have lodged stern representations with the US side on this,"" Geng said.The US should immediately withdraw its arms sales to Taiwan and stop sending the wrong signals to ""Taiwan independence"" separatists, the Chinese mainland's Taiwan Affairs Office said on Tuesday.The US State Department approved a possible $2.2 billion arms sale to the island of Taiwan. The potential sale includes 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks, plus related equipment, and 250 Stinger missiles, CNN reported on Tuesday.The tanks are worth about $2 billion, and the portable surface-to-air missiles cost $223 million, CNN reported.Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump agreed on June 29 to restart trade consultations on the sidelines of the G20 Osaka summit, after a yearlong trade war between the world's two largest economies.""The arms sale approval shows the US is increasingly disregarding China-US relations… The US is adjusting its China policies toward confrontation on all fronts,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University's Institute of International Relations in Beijing, told the Global Times.In the first Taiwan arms sale deal under Trump's presidency, the US went ahead with a $1.42 billion arms sale to the island of Taiwan involving missiles and torpedoes in June 2017.The US then sold $330 million worth of spare parts for warplanes in September 2018 and a $500 million package in April involving pilot training.The latest deal is the biggest in sum, and China should realize that the US will unlikely stop such sales anytime soon, which is bad for China-US relations and cross-Straits relations, Li said, noting that arms sales to the Taiwan region have been used by Washington since it established diplomatic relations with Beijing.Taiwan also applied for 66 F-16V fighter jets at the recommendation of the US in February, but the deal was put on hold due to tensions between China and the US, Taiwan News reported.""If the US continuously sells weapons to the Taiwan region, it would wrongly encourage Taiwan secessionists to further misjudge the situation and may eventually lead to military confrontations.

"Bottle cap challenge hits ChinanDonnie Yen Zidan in the Bottle Cap Challenge Photo: screenshot of video on Donnie Yen Zidan Sina Weibo account Initiated by UFC fighter Max Holloway on Saturday, the Bottle Cap Challenge has gone viral in China recently with celebrities and netizens rushing to try it.The challenge requires participants to untwist a bottle cap from a bottle using a back-spin kick only.While many Chinese netizens believed that no one would be able to beat Hollywood action star Jason Statham at the challenge, Hong Kong martial arts superstar Donnie Yen Zidan, 55, managed it, while blindfolded.Yen shared a video of himself on Sina Weibo on Wednesday in which he showed off his impressive martial arts skills by popping off a bottle cap while blindfolded. He then finished the move with his Ip Man kung fu stance.After watching Yen gracefully knock off the bottle cap without even being able to see it, it was clear that a champion had emerged, commented one netizen, whose opinion represented the views of many other commentators.The trending topic ""Yen Zidan's Bottle Cap Challenge"" has been viewed more than 60 million times as of press time.Inspired by Yen, many netizens posted their own challenge videos, some successful, some less so.While most netizens were crazy about mastering the game, famous Chinese comedian Pan Changjiang raised eyebrows in an unexpected way.

"Taiwan separatists warned against helping HK secessionistsnTourists enjoy the scenery of Yangming Mountain Park in Taipei on February 27, 2019. Photo: Xinhua Experts warned secessionists from the island of Taiwan to abandon their illusion of colluding with secessionists from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) to justify their separatist actions and attempt to subvert the ""one country, two systems"" framework for national reunification.The Chinese experts also stressed that Western forces have been ""active"" in meddling in Hong Kong and Taiwan affairs, but the future of the SAR and the island will not be held hostage by secessionists and their supporters.Recent violent protesters in Hong Kong have been slammed and condemned for jeopardizing the city's stability and rule of law, but they have been echoed by Taiwan's regional officials and secessionist forces.The protests are aimed at an extradition bill, which was meant to address a homicide involving a Hong Kong resident murdered in Taiwan and to plug loopholes in Hong Kong's overall mechanism in juridical assistance. The bill will enable Hong Kong to transfer fugitives to Taiwan and the Chinese mainland.Some radical protesters took to the streets using opposition to the extradition bill as an excuse to storm and vandalize the LegCo chamber, severely trampling on Hong Kong's legal system and disrupting the region's social order.Taiwan officials chimed in, attempting to exploit events in Hong Kong for their own political gain. Regional leader Tsai Ing-wen has vowed to ensure the island's defense, warning of lessons from Hong Kong. Su Tseng-chang, the chief of Taiwan's executive body, has warned the island of following Hong Kong's footsteps for small gain, media reported.In June, Huang Kuo-chang, a major figure in the 2014 ""Sunflower Movement"" against the cross-Straits service trade agreement, and Hsu Yung-ming, a Soochow University political scientist, funded the so-called ""Taiwan-Hong Kong alliance front under Taiwan's Legislative Yuan"" in Taipei out of ""concern for their counterparts"" in Hong Kong.Hong Kong legislators, including Nathan Law Kwun-Chung and Joshua Wong Chi-fung, student leaders of the Hong Kong Occupy protest, attended a tea party to ""celebrate the establishment of the organization.""Since the Hong Kong secessionists launched the illegal Occupy protest, they have never stopped trying to separate Hong Kong from China. Some of them have fled to Taiwan to support Taiwan secessionists and collude with them to challenge the central government and the ""one China, two systems"" policy.Analysts believe the move is the latest evidence of the continuing collusion between pro-secession activists in the two regions.Yang Lixian, a research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center of Cross-Straits Relations, told the Global Times on Wednesday that some Taiwan secessionists, along with Tsai Ing-wen and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), hyped Hong Kong's protest to win support ahead of the upcoming 2020 election. ""They have their own agenda,"" Yang said.After Tsai publicly supported the radical Hong Kong protest, polls suggested that Tsai's approval rating has been rising.By hyping the protest and tarnishing ""one country, two systems,"" Tsai hopes to steer public attention away from many problems Tsai's party is facing, such as a lackluster economy, Yang noted.Echoing Yang, Chang Ya-chung, a professor at the National Taiwan University, told the Global Times that ""the politicians and media in Taiwan just simplify the situation in Hong Kong to incite the Taiwan people's hatred and antagonism toward the Chinese mainland.""In late June, the program of Taiwan TV commentator Huang Chih-hsien was suspended after she said Hong Kong police were violently beaten up by protesters. Huang claimed her show is the first in Taiwan to dare expose the truth, and she believes her show was suspended because it messed up the collusion plans of secessionists from Hong Kong and Taiwan.But Chang noted the majority of Taiwan residents just focused their attention on the situation in Hong Kong and did not show any support to Hong Kong secessionists.

"Mainland, HK can solidify ties by opening marketsnIllustration: Luo Xuan/GT China and the US agreed to resume trade talks during the G20 summit in Japan, breaking the stalemate between the two countries since May. But as more American politicians adopt a hard-line attitude toward China, it may become harder to reason with the US, which has increasingly given up free trade policies to advocate protectionism.But China should not abandon its commitment to further opening its markets. As uncertainties remain in future trade talks, the US may find an opportunity to use Hong Kong as leverage against China.With this in mind, the mainland should foster freer flows of talent and capital within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and beyond.A better policy combination to encourage free movement of talent is essential. According to Hong Kong's Census and Statistics Department, the Special Administrative Region's population has been growing steadily and now stands at nearly 7.5 million. Its unemployment rate, since the beginning of last year, has stayed low at around 2.8 percent. This means that Hong Kong has a healthy, near fully employed labor force. However, it hints at a nearly saturated labor market because future job creation appears slow.The Greater Bay Area is expected to generate more job opportunities in industries including technological innovation, financial services, professional services and logistics. The Funding Scheme for Youth Internships on the Mainland - a program that provides internships on the mainland enabling young people from Hong Kong to gain experience in a working environment and get to know the working culture - has sponsored 149 internship projects in the 2019-20 year.The funding scheme is expected to benefit 3,800 youngsters from Hong Kong. Programs like this serve as a good start in helping the youth from Hong Kong to tap into mainland industries and prepare for the job market in the Greater Bay Area.The mainland should further drop the complicated procedures required to obtain a residence permit, allowing more people from Hong Kong, especially young people, to gain access to job opportunities in the vast mainland market. Since September last year, residents from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan are able to apply for new mainland ID cards if they have lived on the Chinese mainland for six months. It is a step in the right direction. The new card allows them to enjoy more public facilities and services including the convenience of their children going to school and being able to buy houses.Another imperative issue is the free movement of capital. Investment from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan is treated as foreign investment. This situation needs to change.The Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) was intended to foster economic integration and development of both mainland and Hong Kong in the areas of trade, investment and technology cooperation. The trade in goods and services facilitation has come a long way, but investment liberation still has a way to go.The mainland and Hong Kong signed an agreement on investment at the end of June in 2017, committing to enhancing the CEPA. The new investment agreement, which took effect at the beginning of 2018, promised to give Hong Kong national treatment in all non-service sectors except 26 measures.As the blueprint of the Greater Bay Area was rolled out earlier this year the investment agreement can further bolster the boom in the region.Under the background of the trade war, Hong Kong, the financial hub rated as the world's freest economy and one of the economic pillars of the Greater Bay Area, has more potential to cooperate with the mainland.Hong Kong investors set up 39,868 companies on the mainland last year, a 120.68 percent increase from the previous year. The actualized investment from Hong Kong was $89.92 billion, taking up 66.6 percent of total actualized foreign investment.Despite the current efforts, the mainland needs to carry on this trend to land more infrastructure projects such as the Hong Kong Railway Express Link, lift policy barriers and build financial facilitation, making talent and investors from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan more attracted to opportunities in the Greater Bay Area and other regions in the mainland.Only when Hong Kong and the mainland enjoy freer movement of talent and capital can the two sides promote mutually beneficial cooperation.The author is a reporter with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	6/30/19	0	0	0.9993	1

"Election looks difficult for Tsai despite nominationnThe 2020 Taiwan regional election would be difficult for current Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen because of her low support on the island, an expert said on Wednesday, after Tsai's nomination as the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate.DPP nominated Tsai as candidate for the 2020 Taiwan regional election on Wednesday, haiwainet.cn reported.Tsai delivered a speech at the DPP headquarters after being nominated.This was a routine announcement after Tsai defeated her challenger, former Taiwan administrative authority head Lai Ching-te, and won the DPP inner-party primary poll with 35.7 percent of 16,051 respondents, which reflected the low participation of the voters.""The 2020 election will be difficult for Tsai because of the DPP's poor performance in the past four years,"" said Yang Lixian, a research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center on Cross-Straits Relations.""The major defeat of DPP in the 'nine-in-one' elections showed that most people in Taiwan are not satisfied with Tsai's leadership, and there is little time left for Tsai to win them back before 2020,"" Yang said.Among the 22 county and city chief posts, the Kuomintang (KMT) won 15, the DPP six, and the remaining one went to an independent candidate in the ""nine-in-one"" elections on November 24, 2018.The KMT earlier announced five candidates, including Kaohsiung mayor Han Kuo-yu and Foxconn founder and CEO Terry Gou, for the party primary of the 2020 election, and the results will be announced on July 16, haiwainet.cn said.The latest surveys and reports from some Taiwan-based media outlets and institutions said the anti-secession political figures in the island, such as Han and Gou, are more popular than the pro-secessionist DPP candidates and Tsai.Tsai has been stiff against the Chinese mainland since she won the 2016 election, which has closed the door of communication across the Taiwan Straits and brought uncertainties to the region.The US used Tsai's strong pro-secession stance to increase its leverage in dealing with China.

"Taiwan’s DPP phone primary marred by low participationnThe Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) inner-party primary result is not a representation of the will of the people among those on the island since participation was extremely low, said a Chinese mainland expert on Taiwan studies.The DPP announced on Thursday the regional leader of the island, Tsai Ing-wen, had won the DPP primary poll by nearly 35.7 percent, defeating former head of the Taiwan administrative authority Lai Ching-te by 8.2 percentage points, chinatimes.com reported on Thursday.Although Tsai still needs approval from the DPP's executive committee to become the official candidate, her nomination is almost certain to be ratified for the upcoming 2020 election in January.According to the announcement, the result was determined by a public opinion phone survey that included 16,051 respondents, and involved 8,056 calls to landlines, and 7,995 calls to mobile phones.""The sample was really small compared to the population in Taiwan [about 23 million], and Tsai only got less than 36 percent among them to win the primary poll. This shows the DPP has really low support among the people on the island,"" said Li Fei, a professor with the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University, to the Global Times on Thursday.Voters on the island are not interested in participating in the ""election,"" especially after the poor performance from the DPP during the past four years, said Li.According to the Beijing Daily, Tsai manipulated public opinion by including cellphone users into the primary polls and postponing the poll date that was originally scheduled for late March, to secure her party nomination.Earlier this week, Tsai showed support on her Facebook account for the violent demonstrations in Hong Kong, which harm city's stability.The DPP is good at using Taiwan's so-called ""democracy"" as a tool for elections, Li said.Tsai has been assertive against the Chinese mainland with her strong pro-separation stance since she won the 2016 election, which brought tension and uncertainty to Cross-Straits relations "	6/14/19	0	0	0.892	1

"US laser weapons plan triggers arms race concernsnAn HH-60H Sea Hawk helicopter lifts off on March 13, 2011 from the guided missile destroyer USS Preble (DDG 88) after refueling. Photo: IC The US plan to equip its warships with high-energy laser weapons in 2021 is a typical tactic to seek military technological dominance by using China's reasonable military development as an excuse, and the unilateral actions of the US will likely trigger an arms race, Chinese military analysts said on Wednesday.The US destroyer Preble will be the first to be equipped with the High Energy Laser and Integrated Optical-dazzler With Surveillance system, or HELIOS, in 2021, US military newspaper Stars and Stripes reported on Monday.HELIOS will function as a faster close-in weapon that uses light beams to ""defend against Chinese or Russian cruise missiles,"" the report said, claiming that China's in-development drone swarm is also a target of the laser.This is the latest version of the ""China threat theory"" which the US uses to justify its pursuit of military technological dominance, analysts said.It is normal and reasonable for China to steadily develop its military capability consistent with its economic development. But the US is again using the ""China threat theory"" as a scaremongering tactic to gain more funding for new weapons, Li Daguang, a professor at the National Defense University of the People's Liberation Army, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Compared with the aggressive military build-up of the US, China's military capability building is mainly defense-oriented. But to balance US moves of seeking dominance, China will be forced to respond and strengthen its defense capability, analysts said.Based in Pearl Harbor, the Preble is a US Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer, which sailed through the Taiwan Straits and the South China Sea multiple times in May amid the ongoing trade war between China and the US, Reuters reported.US naval ships have been warned off by China which perhaps made the US realize its ships are not good enough, so they now want lasers, Li noted.China might have to develop measures to counter the new US weapon, Li said, stressing the US is to blame for a possible arms race.China is also developing high-energy laser weapons, including the LW-30. Built by the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, the LW-30 vehicle-based laser defense system can shoot a directional-emission high-energy laser and intercept many kinds of aerial targets, including missiles and drones.

"Type 055 destroyer ‘pillar’ of North China Sea fleet: reportnThe guided-missile destroyer Nanchang of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy takes part in a naval parade staged to mark the 70th founding anniversary of the PLA Navy on the sea off Qingdao, east China's Shandong Province, on April 23, 2019. Photo: Xinhua China's first 10,000-ton-class Type 055 destroyer Nanchang is reportedly joining the North China Sea Fleet of the People's Liberation Army Navy, a move that Chinese military experts hailed as crucial to the fleet's combat capability.They also predicted that other Type 055s will also be commissioned into the East China Sea and South China Sea fleets.Nanchang made a brief appearance in an introduction video released by the North China Sea Fleet on Thursday afternoon.Although the video did not elaborate, Weihutang, a column on military affairs affiliated with China Central Television, reported Sunday that the warship would likely join the North China Sea Fleet and become ""one of the pillars to the fleet's combat capability.""The first Type 055 could be commissioned into the North China Sea Fleet as it can form an aircraft carrier combat group around the carrier Liaoning, Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, told the Global Times on Sunday.Nanchang could serve as lead escort to Liaoning, which is based in Qingdao, East China's Shandong Province, Li noted.Another reason behind the naval vessel's potential commissioning in the North China Sea Fleet was that China has already commissioned other advanced warships in the East China Sea and South China Sea fleets.Deploying the first Type 055 destroyer to the North China Sea Fleet balances up the allocation of military resources, according to Li.With a strong air defense capability, Nanchang could protect the Chinese capital region from warplanes or missile attacks in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea areas, analysts pointed out.Future Type 055s will likely also join the South China and East China fleets, Li expected, as the US have frequently sent warships to the South China Sea and across the Taiwan Straits to cause stirs under the excuse of freedom of navigation recently.

"China slams US maritime provocationsnTwo Su-35 fighter jets and a H-6K bomber fly in formation. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) air force conducted patrol training over China's island of Taiwan in May, 2018. (Xinhua/Han Chao) Provocations from the US around China's territorial waters have grown, and Chinese experts warned on Thursday that such actions will only increase the risk of military conflict and do nothing for regional stability and peace.The Chinese side has closely followed and fully grasped the situation of US warships traversing the Taiwan Straits, and the related department has lodged solemn representations, Lu Kang, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said at a routine press conference on Thursday.Lu's remarks came after the US sent two naval vessels through the Taiwan Straits on Wednesday.""The Taiwan question is the most important and sensitive issue in China-US relations. We urge the US to abide by the one-China principle and the three joint communiqués between China and the US and handle them cautiously and properly, so as not to have a negative impact on Sino-US relations,"" Lu warned.Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the PLA Naval Military Studies Research Institute, told the Global Times on Thursday that the US is trying to enlarge its military presence in the Asia-Pacific region under the guise of freedom of navigation, which violates international law and is doomed to fail.Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University's Institute of International Relations in Beijing, told the Global Times that it is not surprising at all that the US will comprehensively put pressure on and provoke China not only in trade, but also in the field of security.The US is ready to sell its idea of Indo-Pacific strategy and probably launch accusations at China on security issues at the upcoming Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, so these actions are also creating an intense atmosphere for the US at the security forum on May 31, Li said.Aside from the Taiwan question, US politicians are also trying to hype issues related to other parts of China's territorial waters.US Senator Marco Rubio told the South China Morning Post that US senators from both political parties are expected to reintroduce an act on Thursday committing the US government to curb Chinese individuals and entities involved in activities in the South China Sea and East China Sea.China firmly opposes the proposal, which violates the basic norms of international law and international relations, Lu said on Thursday, adding, ""we urge the US to refrain from promoting the review of relevant proposals and avoid further disrupting China-US relations.""He noted that China's construction of islands and reefs on its own territory in the South China Sea is entirely within the scope of sovereignty.

"US lacks clear consensus on China policyn Illustration: Liu Rui/GT In the past few days, two striking news in China-US relations have been catching people's attention. One is US side's abrupt decision to suspend China-US trade negotiations and continue to impose tariffs on Chinese goods; the other is the US House of Representatives passed two Taiwan-related bills, noting Washington should ""conduct 'regular sales and defense articles' to Taiwan and backing Taiwan's participation in international organizations,"" according to Reuters. As the timing of the two events is very close, it gives the impression that the US government and US Congress will unite and jointly exert pressure on China.Has current US government changed its attitude toward China significantly? Has the US reached a clear consensus on its China policy? Or is the Taiwan card played by the House in line with Washington's trade diplomacy? What is the role of this Taiwan card in the House? How do we respond?First, I don't think the tone of current administration's China policy has changed. To make a deal, to make a big deal remains the basic logic and keynote of US President Donald Trump's China policy. Trump will not hesitate to make a deal if it can boost domestic employment and his approval ratings. In terms of timing, Trump's policy also embodies the electoral politics, because the third year in office is often important for the incumbent president in his re-election campaign in the coming year. So, Trump also needs to make political achievements and fight for votes.Second, the US has yet formed a clear consensus on its China policy. The House's act is an isolated incident. It is not meant to support administration's diplomacy but objectively speaking, it is possibly an act of domestic politics by the US elite establishment to thwart Trump.The Taiwan-related bill passed by the House is an example. The Taiwan card is the most powerful but also the most dangerous card that the US anti-China forces can play. The anti-China establishment is also exerting vigorous influence on the Trump administration's policy toward China. However, from an objective perspective, by playing the Taiwan card, Congress is in fact stirring up troubles for Trump. The US establishment elites understand that the Taiwan question is related to China's core interests, and China has no room for concessions or negotiations on it. Playing the Taiwan card is a strategic attempt to block Trump's economic and trade achievements, and to prevent his re-election next year.For this reason, I believe that the Taiwan Assurance Act of 2019 and the House Resolution 273 reaffirming the US commitment to Taiwan and the implementation of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) are merely the wishful thinking of the US establishment elites. It won't strengthen Taiwan's security. Instead, they may embolden Taiwan secessionist forces to take risks, resulting in a full-scale conflict and a catastrophic head-on collision between China and the US.This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of China-US diplomatic relations. In general, China-US relations are an asymmetrical relationship. The US seems to have been domineering and proactive with quite a few options at its disposal and loud voices. China, on the other hand, has been relatively passive. It does not have many good cards to play or a strong discourse. But at the same time, it is noticeable that the development and changes in China itself are, in many cases, the key variables affecting China-US relations.For example, in 1969, China sent a positive signal to improve relations. In 1972, then president Richard Nixon's China tour broke the ice in China-US relations. When China decided to open its door of reform and opening-up, it marked the formal establishment of China-US diplomatic relations in 1979. After the international financial crisis in 2008, China's proactive response has resulted in active China-US cooperation within the framework of the G20 . Thus, China can play an active role in shaping China-US relations.We must make it clear to the anti-China US establishment that their tricks will not succeed. The traditional ""3T"" cards, namely the Taiwan card, the Tibetan (human rights) card and the trade card, are no longer working well. In the context of globalization, China and the US are inextricably linked.The fundamental strategic cooperation (global security and peace, regional hotspot issues, energy, climate change, etc.) between China and the US, the two most powerful nations in history, cannot be ignored. Therefore, the failure of China-US relations is an unbearable disaster for both countries and the world.The author is dean of the College of International Relations, Huaqiao University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	5/14/19	0	1	0.9831	1

(Xinhua/Zheng Huansong) Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen asked US defense industry companies to help the island produce aircraft and vessels at a recent meeting, and Chinese mainland military observers said on Tuesday that this will damage regional peace but will not narrow the gap in military strength between the mainland and the island.According to the website of the island leader's office, Tsai met with a defense industry delegation from the US-Taiwan Business Council (USTBC) on Monday.Tsai said in order to ""maintain cross-Strait peace and regional stability, Taiwan has been proactive in building its defense through arms purchases, and increasing its defense self-sufficiency by pursuing the domestic production of aircraft and sea vessels.""Tsai said she hopes the USTBC could help Taiwan and the island's defense manufacturers link up with ""the global supply chain and sell to a global market.""The US business delegation is in Taiwan for the second Taiwan-US Defense Business Forum, expected to be held on Wednesday in Taoyuan, Taiwan, to discuss ""granular issues of bilateral cooperation in the defense industry supply chain,""according to the USTBC website.Tsai has always been criticized by people of the island for spending huge money to ""buy useless and outdated weapons from the US,"" said Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military analyst, noted that since Tsai wants to get the support of US defense giants to upgrade F-16 fighter jets and build a submarine in the island, it is much easier to cooperate with US companies than with the US government.The US won't trust Taiwan and offer any advanced technologies, because once the reunification of China is achieved, these technologies will fall into the hands of the mainland, Li noted, while adding ""Cooperation with US defense companies could improve Taiwan's military capability to some extent, mainland's overwhelming military advantage won't be affected at all,"" Li said.

"Reunification will be achieved irrespective of who wins 2020 Taiwan electionsnReunification will be achieved irrespective of who wins 2020 Taiwan elections Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou said on Wednesday that he will run for Taiwan regional leader in 2020. This will make the election more dramatic. The Kuomintang (KMT) and the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) primary elections are competitive, and whether Han Kuo-yu will be drafted by the KMT into the election is still unknown. Gou is a world-famous entrepreneur. Although he has been with the KMT for 50 years, Gou is a political neophyte. Foxconn has most factories and millions of workers on the Chinese mainland. Gou has good personal relations with US President Donald Trump. Foxconn invested heavily and built factories in the US after Trump took office. Gou said Wednesday that he supports cross-Straits peace. In popularity stakes, Gou's ratings match Han's but are much higher than current Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen's. If Gou becomes Taiwan regional leader, cross-Straits tensions would be eased. But the mainland should not expect that the election will restrain ""Taiwan independence"" forces to a great extent. Due to the island's political system, the rotation of ruling parties on the island will lead to intermittent changes in its cross-Straits policies. Chen Shui-bian left a mess after his 8-year tenure; Ma Ying-jeou put an end to that; but Tsai Ing-wen brought back tensions. The cycle could repeat no matter who is elected in 2020. Who will win the election is crucial for cross-Straits relations in the short term. But in the long run, it is not that important as it would only be another part of the political cycle. Neither the KMT nor DPP can rule the island for long due to the system. Beijing must constantly enhance dominance of cross-Straits relations by building up strength and proper policies toward the island. The Chinese mainland has now become the world's second-largest economy with second-biggest military budget after the cross-Straits crisis in 1996. Currently, the island is much less capable of making trouble while it is increasingly difficult for the US to interfere in Taiwan affairs. From a macroscopic point of view, only such power structural changes can shape the direction of the Taiwan question. Political games inside the island will eventually be left behind by history. Hence, the Chinese mainland doesn't need to be concerned about such unnecessary distractions, but should focus more on what is actually critical. The mainland is committed to the reunification. If Taiwan authorities are moderate, the mainland can execute the task in an unhurried manner. If Taiwan authorities are radical, the task will be more urgent. But the task will eventually be carried out in any case. The mainland welcomes forces willing to maintain the 1992 Consensus to hold power in Taiwan. But it is no big deal if the incoming authority continues the current radical policies or undertakes even more extreme ones. It will force us to take measures earlier. In the games that involve the Chinese mainland, Taiwan and the US, the mainland is obviously least afraid of Taiwan resorting to a face-off.

The news was received with wide-scale support from within the island. Being a businessman and now delving into politics, local people anticipate positive change in the economy with him at the helm.This enthusiasm makes it very evident that the people in the island are eager for a change and want a respite from the worsening cross-Straits situation caused by the pro-secession Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) which currently governs the island, experts noted.Gou, the richest man in Taiwan also known as Guo Taiming, announced his decision on Wednesday to run as a candidate of the pro-reunification KMT party.Gou said he decided to run after receiving instructions from Mazu in his dream. Mazu is the Chinese goddess and patroness of the sea who is widely worshiped by people of coastal regions in China.""I had a dream in which the goddess of the sea encouraged me to 'come forward' to support cross-Straits peace and do good things and bring hope to young people,"" Gou said, according to Taiwan's Central News Agency.The 68-year-old businessman, who now leads Foxconn, the world's largest original equipment manufacturer and a major contractor for US tech giant Apple, has a large business footprint on the Chinese mainland. Gou's decision has sparked hot discussions across the Taiwan Straits.""He is not stepping down [from Foxconn] but switching to a non-leading position, making more room for young people while still focusing on strategic directions,"" a Foxconn spokesperson told the Global Times Wednesday.Gou also said at a media event that he wasn't thinking about the elections until six months back, but later he began to feel that young people on the island needed a future, Forbes reported on Wednesday.Gou said that ""peace, security, economy and the future"" should be the key focus while solving the Taiwan question, and promised a bright future to the young generation if he is elected to the position of Taiwan's regional leader.Gou is a renowned business leader who enjoys close ties with the political and business circles both in the Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan, and is well-known in the international community, Zhu Songling, a professor at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of Beijing Union University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.""He will help stabilize cross-Straits relations if he becomes the leader of the island,"" Zhu said.An online survey conducted by Taiwan-based news portal udn.com, where about 27,000 web users participated, showed at press time that more than 80 percent of netizens in Taiwan are in favor of Gou as the leader. A comment on his personal Facebook account said, ""Taiwan has been lost for some time now, and it is time to get it back on the right track.""As a famous entrepreneur, Gou's popularity shows Taiwan's public opinion has undergone subtle changes since 2016 [when DPP took power]. Now the public is calling for those who can bring peace and development across the Taiwan Straits to become leaders of the Taiwan region, Zhu told the Global Times.Han Kuo-yu, another KMT senior party member and the mayor of Kaohsiung, received more than 5,000 votes in the survey following Gou, and he is also a supporter of the one-China principle. He visited the mainland and met with the mainland officials in March.Gou has benefited from economic exchanges across the Taiwan Straits in the past years, and he is bound to witness cross-Straits relations moving toward a better direction, Wang Jianmin, a fellow researcher from the Institute of Taiwan Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said.Gou founded Hon Hai/Foxconn Technology Group in the Taiwan region in 1974 and opened his first factory in the Chinese mainland in 1988. Gou and Foxconn seized the opportunity of the mainland's opening-up and moved up in the global economic chain. By August 2017, Forbes listed his net worth at $10.6 billion.Hon Hai-related stocks rose elsewhere in the region on Wednesday. Foxconn Industrial Internet Co. climbed by the 10 percent daily limit in Shanghai. FIH Mobile Ltd. jumped 25 percent as of 3:34 pm in Hong Kong, and is all set for the biggest gain since November 2012, reported by Bloomberg on Wednesday.Some raised the question whether Gou, with no previous political experience, can be a successful regional leader. There are also people who compared Gou to US President Donald Trump, who also transitioned to politics from business.Business leaders are more pragmatic and down-to-earth than traditional politicians, and are expected to bring some hope to the pressing economic and livelihood issues in Taiwan, Wang said""Gou is the chairman of the leading high-tech conglomerate that boasts the global vision and open-minded ideas. His business accomplishments are universally acclaimed in business circles. He can be more flexible in making relevant policies and strategies if he is the one to hold power some day,"" Zhu said.Tsai Ing-wen, the current leader of Taiwan region, will have a high probability of losing the election if she locks horns with Gou, but the mainland should not pin its hopes on eliminating the risk of Taiwan independence through the election on the island, experts on Taiwan studies from the mainland said.The increase in military deterrence and economic pressure from the mainland are the most important factors to contain secessionists in Taiwan, which is also the foundation of the peace in the Taiwan Straits, so the pressure of the mainland needs to be strong enough to remind Taiwan people that confrontation with the mainland and seeking secession is a dead end, experts noted.

Now the public is calling for those who can bring peace and development across the Taiwan Straits to become leaders of the Taiwan region, Zhu told the Global Times.Han Kuo-yu, another KMT senior party member and the mayor of Kaohsiung, received more than 5,000 votes in the survey following Gou, and he is also a supporter of the one-China principle. He visited the mainland and met with the mainland officials in March.Gou has benefited from economic exchanges across the Taiwan Straits in the past years, and he is bound to witness cross-Straits relations moving toward a better direction, Wang Jianmin, a fellow researcher from the Institute of Taiwan Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said.Gou founded Hon Hai/Foxconn Technology Group in the Taiwan region in 1974 and opened his first factory in the Chinese mainland in 1988. Gou and Foxconn seized the opportunity of the mainland's opening-up and moved up in the global economic chain. By August 2017, Forbes listed his net worth at $10.6 billion.Hon Hai-related stocks rose elsewhere in the region on Wednesday. Foxconn Industrial Internet Co. climbed by the 10 percent daily limit in Shanghai. FIH Mobile Ltd. jumped 25 percent as of 3:34 pm in Hong Kong, and is all set for the biggest gain since November 2012, reported by Bloomberg on Wednesday.Some raised the question whether Gou, with no previous political experience, can be a successful regional leader. There are also people who compared Gou to US President Donald Trump, who also transitioned to politics from business.Business leaders are more pragmatic and down-to-earth than traditional politicians, and are expected to bring some hope to the pressing economic and livelihood issues in Taiwan, Wang said""Gou is the chairman of the leading high-tech conglomerate that boasts the global vision and open-minded ideas. His business accomplishments are universally acclaimed in business circles. He can be more flexible in making relevant policies and strategies if he is the one to hold power some day,"" Zhu said.Tsai Ing-wen, the current leader of Taiwan region, will have a high probability of losing the election if she locks horns with Gou, but the mainland should not pin its hopes on eliminating the risk of Taiwan independence through the election on the island, experts on Taiwan studies from the mainland said.The increase in military deterrence and economic pressure from the mainland are the most important factors to contain secessionists in Taiwan, which is also the foundation of the peace in the Taiwan Straits, so the pressure of the mainland needs to be strong enough to remind Taiwan people that confrontation with the mainland and seeking secession is a dead end, experts noted.

"Foxconn chairman: Sea goddess Mazu inspires me to run for Taiwan leadernFoxconn chairman: Sea goddess Mazu inspires me to run for Taiwan leader Terry Guo, chairman of Foxconn, said he will run for Taiwan leader in next year's local elections on the island after receiving instructions from Mazu, the Chinese goddess of the sea, media reported Wednesday. ""I had a dream in which the goddess of the sea encouraged me to 'come forward' to support cross-Straits peace and do good things and bring hope to young people,"" he said. The 68-year-old businessman, who now leads Foxconn, the world's largest original equipment manufacturer and a major contractor for US tech giant Apple, will reportedly step down from his current position, sparking speculations that the move could be related to his political ambitions. ""He is not stepping down but switching to a non-leading position, leaving more room for young people while still focusing on strategic directions,"" a Foxconn spokesperson told the Global Times Wednesday. Guo is currently the richest man on the island of Taiwan but has a large business footprint on the Chinese mainland. He said at a media event that he wasn't thinking about the elections six months ago, but four months ago, he began to feel that young people on the island needed a future, Forbes reported Wednesday. Shares of Foxconn-related stock surged following reports about Guo's announcement to run for office in 2020. The stock price of Foxconn Industrial Internet increased 10 percent at mid-day trading.

"US using Taiwan question as ruse to interfere in China’s internal affairsnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT According to CNN on Tuesday, the US State Department has approved a possible deal with Taiwan to renew a $500 million training program for Taiwan's F-16 pilots and maintenance crews. It is also worth noting that April 10 marks the 40th anniversary of the US' unilateral creation of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). To commemorate the piece of legislation that lays down how Washington was supposed to deal with the island, the US acted quite conspicuously. The American Enterprise Institute issued a report calling for strengthening US relations with Taiwan, and likely, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the Brookings Institution as well as senior officials in the US government participated in commemorative seminars. Moreover, former House speaker Paul Ryan will lead a delegation to visit Taiwan for TRA events. How is one to understand the US' eagerness to deepen its ties with Taiwan?First, it needs to be understood in the broader context of a change in the US policy toward China. The US regards China as a ""strategic competitor."" It has tried to raise the heat on China in the fields of economy, people-to-people contacts, international order and military security.Due to the US' stubborn Cold War mentality, China-US relations face severe challenges. The US' policies toward China are aimed at undermining the international environment for China's rapid development.The Taiwan question is a key component of the US' overall policy toward China. It is noteworthy that the US observed the 40th anniversary of relations with China pretty quietly while similar commemorative events over Taiwan have been designed to steal the spotlight.Second, in the past two years, the US' Taiwan-related policies have been chipping at its ""one China"" policy. The US is gradually changing its earlier way of obscuring ""one China"" connotations, and dangerously trying to promote its ""one China, one Taiwan"" leaning. To the US, ""one China"" more and more refers to the Chinese mainland.In 2018, the US Congress and the government have used the Taiwan Travel Act and the National Defense Authorization Act to promote relations with authorities on the island, enhance Taiwan's so-called international activity space, and encourage reciprocal visits between warships. All this has diluted the ""one China"" consensus on Taiwan-related issues formed since the establishment of China-US diplomatic relations 40 years ago.From 2018, the US has on several occasions broken the convention of maintaining only unofficial links with Taiwan, manifested in its State Department officials' high-profile and frequent visits to the island. The US' arms sale and possible warship visits to Taiwan make it more difficult to solve the Taiwan question in a constructive way. The US proclivity for changing its approach to Taiwan verges on the dangerous and can lead to instability in the Taiwan Straits.Third, the US is trying to retard China's development momentum by intensive policy adjustments on Taiwan-related issues. There is only one China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. This should form the crux of stable China-US relations. The US has been constantly making trouble on the Taiwan question. It amounts to interference in China's internal affairs.Social stability and economic prosperity in China have come about thanks to the country's reforms and opening-up, which is inseparable from its territorial integrity and sovereignty. The US is bent on provoking tensions in the Taiwan Straits and stirring up disputes. Aggravating internal strife, triggering chaos and queering the pitch for China's prosperity and development is what the US wants by raking up the Taiwan question.Since the late 1940s, the US has never given up attempts to use Taiwan to intervene in China's internal affairs. The US way of dealing with Taiwan-related issues smacks of a colonial mind-set. The times are changing. China has undergone profound changes. Hence, the US approach to Taiwan will end in complete failure.Fourth, it is likely that this year the Taiwan question will be the focus of China-US disputes, like last year's trade friction. The US is very likely to raise the number and frequency of US officials visiting Taiwan. It is also likely to carry out the so-called mutual warship visits to Taiwan in a disguised manner.Given Trump's personality, using the Chinese island as a bargaining chip with Beijing on other issues such as China's participation in the US-Russia nuclear disarmament agreement can't be excluded. The Taiwan question involves China's core interests and is the political foundation for stable China-US relations. Any changes in the US policy on Taiwan will have a huge impact on this relationship, which is closely related to regional and global order.Therefore, the US needs to exercise prudence on Taiwan and abide by the one-China principle based on the three joint communiqués between China and the US. Any US provocative move in the Taiwan Straits is detrimental to the interests of all parties. We hope to form a mutually beneficial China-US relationship, which needs efforts by both sides.The author is a professor with the Institute of International Relations, China Foreign Affairs University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	4/16/19	0	0	0.7584	1
"PLA drills around Taiwan help cross-Straits stability: spokesmannPLA drills around Taiwan help cross-Straits stability: spokesman The recent encirclement drills of vessels, bombers and reconnaissance aircraft from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command recently undertook around the island of Taiwan helps with cross-Straits peace and stability, according to a military spokesperson. The encirclement is a necessary training, and tests the combat capability of integrating multiple military branches, said Zhang Chunhui, spokesperson of the PLA Eastern Theater Command. Zhang said that it is a normal annual arrangement and is totally in line with a sovereign country's legitimate rights. The PLA Air Force and Navy will continue conducting frequent island encirclement exercises. The drill this time, just as previous ones, aims to create a formidable military deterrence against Taiwan separatists, said an anonymous expert from National Defense University of the PLA. The drill came after two PLA fighter jets crossed the ""middle line"" of the Taiwan Straits on March 31, which Taiwan called the mainland's ""provocative"" actions that ""seriously impact regional safety and stability,"" according to Taiwan's Military News Agency. Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council said on April 10 that this is a normal training arrangement of the PLA. Protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity is a sacred duty of the PLA and benefits compatriots across the Straits, said Ma. The anonymous military expert told the Global Times that the ""middle line"" is only a psychological line which separates the Taiwan Straits, and neither side usually crosses the line. Both sides are Chinese territory, plus the Chinese mainland has never recognized the line. Global Times "	4/15/19	0	0	0.9559	1
"Actress apologizes after suspected of supporting 'Taiwan independence'nXu Weining Photo: IC Taiwan actress Xu Weining apologized on Thursday after she liked tweets suspected of supporting Taiwan secession on Instagram, which received different reactions on social media.Xu, a mixed-blood of Chinese, American and Italian, recently liked a tweet of a photo of a Japanese view, and caption containing content regarding Taiwan as an independent country on Instagram, which was slammed by Chinese mainland netizens.Xu posted an apology and explanation on Sina Weibo on Thursday.""I just found myself making a stupid mistake… I just liked the tweet habitually without paying attention to the caption…My ancestral home is Wuhu in (East China's) Anhui Province…Residents across strait are family…"" wrote Xu, promising she would be more careful about her words and acts.Xu soon closed her account on Instagram claiming it was for introspection. Xu's office also published an apology letter handwritten by Xu.Some netizens joyfully accepted her apology. ""Her apology is sincere, her explanation is clear and reasonable,"" wrote a netizen on Sina Weibo, also calling other netizens not to be overly nationalistic and critical.Some Taiwan people said Xu's statement did not clear her political stand of the One-China principle. ""Many Taiwan people are originally from the Chinese mainland. And we are exactly all China descendants,"" commented a Taiwan netizen on Instagram.""It's a typical case of double-dealing,"" a Beijing-based employee in the entertainment industry, who asked for anonymity, told the Global Times, claiming that she made similar multiple mistakes on Instagram.The apology is more like surrendering to public pressure rather than someone showing true repentance, she said.

"Impact of Taiwan Relations Act dwindlingnApril 10 marks the 40th anniversary of the US' Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which both the US and the island of Taiwan place great emphasis on. This act, a US domestic law, took effect a few months after China and the US established diplomatic relations in 1979. The act has served as the ""legal basis"" for the US to interfere in China's internal affairs and make moves in the Taiwan Straits, including arms sales to the island. ""Taiwan independence"" forces have regarded the TRA as their spiritual prop and also a stabilizer of ties between the island and the US. The act is actually a sign of the US' declining ability to contain the Chinese mainland. Taiwan was once a public US ally. In the late Cold War, however, the US had to turn to Chinese mainland as its ability to contain the Soviet Union was not equal to its ambition. The TRA provided pivot for the US' retreat. Superficially, the TRA is taken seriously by Washington. The US even enacted the Taiwan Travel Act and the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018 on the basis of the TRA to interfere in China. But, overall, the TRA's actual impact on the situation in the Taiwan Straits is declining. The US has not only lost its dominance in the Straits, but also faces an irreversible decline in its coercive power politically and militarily in this region. An act can only be effective with strong implementation power. In 1979, the US enjoyed overwhelming military and economic advantages in the Western Pacific region. But now, the Chinese mainland's strength in the Straits and its surrounding areas has grown extraordinarily. The TRA has historically lost its power. The mainland was once not powerful enough to project its influence on the island. It was Taiwan's military strength and the TRA that emboldened ""Taiwan independence"" forces. At that time, the Chinese mainland defense of the one-China principle mainly depended on the US' adherence to the three joint communiqués between China and the US. Even the tiniest move of the US was given importance. The Chinese central government passed the Anti-Secession Law in 2005. The mainland's growing comprehensive strength and military power have provided more ability to enforce this law. Today's mainland has increasing capabilities to ensure that the one-China principle is widely recognized. When China-US relations were better, the US placed particular emphasis on the three joint communiqués. Now it stresses the TRA more often. The TRA is bound to collapse if the US uses it to confront the China's Anti-Secession Law. Should Taiwan authorities believe the TRA's vague commitment of protecting the island, or should they fear the Anti-Secession Law's warning of employing non-peaceful means to suppress ""Taiwan independence?"" The latter's deterrence is obviously more credible. The future of the cross-Straits situation does not depend on Washington's explanation of the TRA, or on how much it will enhance its relations with the island. It depends on how fast the mainland's attraction for Taiwan grows, and on support of the one-China principle provided by the mainland's increasing military strength. People's Liberation Army fighter jets crossed the ""middle-line"" of the Taiwan Straits recently, and this is only a warning. The mainland can take further military action much more powerful than the political show performed by the US and the island. The two should view the TRA realistically, or else they will be dragged into an unaffordable cross-Straits situation. "	4/10/19	0	0	0.9931	1

""We urge the US not to make wrong practices,"" Lu said.In a video teleconferencing speech given to US think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies on Tuesday, Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen urged the US to make it clear that protecting the security of Taiwan is vital to ""the defense of democracy.""Mainland experts warned that the US should realize the TRA will become a serious burden to Washington when the mainland has no choice but to solve the Taiwan question militarily or the day China's reunification is realized.China's reunification is certain, which is only a matter of time, and if the US strictly follows the Act, then the Act could draw the US into unnecessary conflicts with China when the reunification is realized or during the process of reunification, so weakening the Act's influence is a wise choice for the US, said analysts.The TRA is meant to maintain US economic and trade interests with the island after the two sides ended their diplomatic ties. However, the TRA doesn't include definite promise to Taiwan or clear obligation of the US should military clash erupts between mainland and the island, despite allowing the US to sell defensive weapons to the island.The TRA has offered an alleged domestic legal basis for the US to interfere in cross-Straits affairs, analysts noted. When the US follows the TRA, it will unavoidably challenge the bottom line of China by breaking the three joint communiqués and weaken the one-China principle.From a practical point of view, the US tends to implement a ""two China"" policy in accordance with the TRA, Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University, said.Chinese analysts said that after 40 years, the influence of the TRA has been gradually weakened as China has the capability to exert its influence on regional affairs and cross-Straits situation doesn't depend on what the US says .Xin believes the US will continue to abide by the TRA, including its promise to the island, such as selling arms to the island, and the US will also continue to remain ambiguous on the cross-Straits question.But Jin Yi, an expert at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that the role of the TRA will be gradually weakened and the US will restrain itself on the Taiwan question.

""Taiwan secessionists should be clear that they won't get an absolute security guarantee from the US under this circumstance, but might be bankrupted from purchasing expensive but useless US weapons, and this would only benefit arms dealers.""The US reportedly gave its tacit approval to Taiwan's request to buy more than 60 US-made F-16V fighter jets.

An investigation team spoke with the main members of the Fuzhou E-Fly Education Agency (E-Fly) and ""ruled out the possibility"" of Chen Kuo-hsing signing a contract with the platform or giving lectures to students, read a notice from the Fuzhou Education Bureau. Chen, a teacher from Taiwan, is involved in the alleged seduction case of Lin Yi-han, a former student of his. Lin later wrote about the incident in the book Fang Si-Chi's First Love Paradise before committing suicide in 2017. Chen said in May 2017 that he had ""an affair with Lin for two months in 2009,"" and claimed it was a ""romantic relationship"" and not a teacher seducing a female student, Taipei Times reported. Since Friday, netizens began reporting online that Chen Kuo-hsing had changed his name to Chen Yi and set up the ""Chen Yi Chinese Language online education platform"" at a training institution in Fuzhou. E-Fly invited a group of Taiwan teachers, which included Chen, to share their teaching experience on March 3. Chen later gave online lectures to E-Fly teachers on four occasions, sharing training methods free of charge. As the online platform is open to the public, some parents also attended the class, according to Fuzhou's education bureau. The bureau required E-Fly to rectify the situation immediately and thoroughly, and will punish the agency according to related regulations and laws. It said that the reporting system used to hire teachers would be stricter and requirements with regards to teachers' moral standards would be set higher. "	4/8/19	0	0	-0.0422	-1
"Thousands evacuated after Taiwan chemical plant explosionnThousands evacuated after Taiwan chemical plant explosion More than 10,000 villagers had to be evacuated after an explosion rocked a chemical plant in an industrial zone in Mailiao township, Yunlin county in central-southern Taiwan Sunday afternoon. The explosion at an aromatics plant of Formosa Chemical and Fiber Corp at about 2 p.m. shattered glass in nearby buildings and shook houses kilometers away, local police and fire fighters said. Though there have been no immediate reports of human death or injuries, authorities have ordered the evacuation of more than 10,000 villagers of five nearby villages due to gas leak after the explosion. Footage posted online by witnesses showed dense plume of black smoke billowing into the sky, and loud explosions were heard far from the chemical plant. ""The explosion was very powerful as it was heard across the county,"" Cai Chang-kun, head of Mailiao township, told the press after the blast, adding he had demanded the chemical plant suspend operation and investigate the cause of the accident. Fire fighters and police arrived at the scene about 20 minutes after receiving an explosion report. Preliminary investigations show a gas leak due to a fracture in a liquefied natural gas pipeline could have led to the explosion, according to local TV reports. Zhang Li-shan, magistrate of Yunlin county, said she has instructed a special team to look into the accident and strengthen the monitoring of air pollution to decide whether the black fume would cause damage to humans. The chemical plant was handed a preliminary fine of 5 million new Taiwan dollars (about 162,000 US dollars) over the violation of air pollution regulations by the county government.

"Mainland student tells of harrowing espionage trial in TaiwannNight view of Taipei Photo: IC Editor's Note: Editor's Note: GT: Will you please introduce yourself and explain your current situation? On March 9, 2017, Zhou Hongxu, a student from the Chinese mainland studying in Taiwan, was arrested by the Taipei District Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of violating the ""National Security Act"" for ""buying information"" from an official from the "" Ministry of Foreign Affairs ."" Zhou denied the accusation, but pled guilty in July 2017 after being detained for four months.Zhou was transferred to a local court in Taipei where he was accused of ""unsuccessful attempts to develop organizations in governmental institutions for the Chinese mainland"" on July 6, 2017. During the trial, Zhou said that the investigators took advantage of his eagerness for freedom to persuade him to plead guilty. Zhou received a sentence of one year and two months.Zhou's case sparked controversy across the Taiwan Straits, with many commenting that Taiwan local authorities fabricated proof in the case to stir up trouble.Zhou is currently forbidden from leaving Taipei by local authorities.In an interview with the Global Times (GT), he recalled the whole experience and said that local authorities in Taiwan hyped his case to show their loyalty to pro-independence Tsai Ing-wen and her Democratic Progress Party (DPP) and to distract local residents from their political failures.My name is Zhou Hongxu. I was charged with espionage by the Taiwan Prosecutor's Office. In March 2017, I was detained by the Taipei District Prosecutor's Offices for violating the ""National Security Act"".On September 15, 2017, I was sentenced to one year and two months in prison by the Taipei District Court, and released on May 8, 2018.But now, I am still in Taipei as the Taiwan authorities have banned me from returning to the Chinese mainland because of the investigation into the New Party Youth Committee case. Zhou Hongxu in Ilan County, Taiwan before he was arrested Photo: Courtesy of Zhou Hongxu GT: How did you end up studying in Taiwan? GT: Is there a direct link between your arrest with this previous experience? GT: Could you share your experience after being arrested? GT: What were the ""inappropriate procedures"" the Taiwan authorities did during the investigation and hearing in your case? GT: Why did the Taiwan authorities refuse to let you come back to the mainland? GT: Do you worry about your situation and your safety after revealing these things to the media? I am the only child in my family. I am making a living on savings and funds from my family because the Taiwan authorities won't allow me to work. Since 2017, it has cost me nearly 10,000 yuan ($1,486) per month no matter how much I save. My three Unionpay cards can't be used right now. The banks in the mainland say there is no problem with them, so it seems likely that Taiwan has done something. The funds from my family cannot be withdrawn. This is a great infringement on my subsistence rights.In addition, I have to report to the authorities twice a day, which takes me three hours. Fortunately, I am optimistic but can only spend my spare time writing and drawing.I am from Benxi, Northeast China's Liaoning Province. In 2009, while studying in Zhejiang University in Zhejiang, East China's Zhejiang Province, I went on an exchange program with Taiwan Tamkang University for several months. The kindness of Taiwan people impressed me a lot. After my graduation in 2012, I went to the department of business administration at Taiwan National Chengchi University for postgraduate studies.In 2014, the ""Sunflower Movement"" changed my impression of Taiwan. I was treated badly by my classmates after expressing some opinions against the movement. Sometimes they refused to greet me or even shouted harsh words at me. Still, there were two or three classmates who didn't dare talk to me because of the pressure but left messages for me on social media, saying, ""I'm sorry I can't support you in public, but my heart is with you"".I think I shouldn't have spoken my opinion. If my grandson asks me in the future what I did when facing Taiwan pro-independence activists, what should I answer? I later found a community called China Rise in National Taiwan University, in which the members shared the same opinions as students from the Chinese mainland.We gathered together frequently and sometimes made speeches. I made a lot of friends when I graduated from university. When I look back at that time, I realize that I had caught the attention of the authorities.The man who framed me appeared in May 2016. He told me that his name was Chen Chaowei, but who knows whether this was an alias. He said he was working for the ""Ministry of Foreign Affairs,"" but later I found out that he was from Taiwan's ""Military Intelligence Bureau.""He approached me through a girl who I had met at Tamkang University. He said that he was studying at Taiwan National Chengchi University and wanted to get to know students from the mainland and their ideas on the Belt and Road Initiative for his paper.Using this as an excuse, he began to get acquainted with many mainland students at National Taiwan University and Taiwan National Chengchi University but kept in touch with very few of them. I believe he finally chose to target me since I was talkative and did not keep my guard up.He invited me for dinner and sent me cakes as presents, which was noticeable. If I were really the spy the Taiwan authorities accuse me of being, isn't it more logical that it should be me who was actively inviting others?When we were in court, Chen denied the above facts by saying that he did not remember it, and the judge never verified his testimony. They acted like hoodlums in court, which was not open to the public.I returned to Taiwan in February 2017 as an executive of a company to make contact with my friends who wanted to start businesses. This was purely for business, and we were busy with social engagements with potential business partners.On March 7, Chen kept offering me drinks at a banquet and kept asking me to introduce officials from the mainland. He said he still worked at the ""Ministry of Foreign Affairs"" and hoped to arrange meetings with these officials overseas. I was annoyed by him and joked that ""I will introduce Japanese officials to you when you go to Japan!"" By saying this, I clearly expressed my boredom with him. After the banquet, Chen secretly passed me a bag with the Chinese characters ""Ministry of Foreign Affairs"" on it. I refused to take it.Then on March 9, I was arrested in a remote mountainous area. A lawyer told me later that the bag was bait and if I had taken it at that time, I would have been arrested on the spot.Some investigators broke into my house to search for business cards. Hundreds of them were from people in business circles and only three or four were from public servants from the Chinese mainland. I exchanged these cards at cross-Straits communication activities, and they meant nothing.But the investigators did not think so - they thought they finally had clues linking me with the mainland. The most ridiculous thing was that after finding nothing of value, they began asking me about my frequent contact with a person named ""Lao Han"" on my phone. ""Whose codename is this Lao Han? Your superior?"" I answered that ""it's my mother.""Without finding concrete evidence, they tried to force me to plead guilty by other means. An investigator told me in a car, ""Hongxu, you're about the same age as my son. You can't waste your youth this way. If you plead guilty, we can put in a word for you. Since the crime you committed was not that big, you can be sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison in accordance with the law. Since you did not commit the crime successfully, you will be sentenced to less than two and a half years. And considering your good attitude, the sentence will be reduced to one year and three months. There will be no chance of letting you go without you pleading guilty. You have to do it.""Honestly speaking, I was almost convinced because I had such a tough time since being detained on March 9, 2017.During my detention, I was kept in a room of less than five square meters shared with one or two people, in which we ate, drank, used the toilet and slept. When you slept, one person's shoulder would be right next to that of another person, who may have tattoos or be taking drugs. Everyone in the room got skin ulcers because of the humidity. Apart from the hearings, I stayed in the cell for six and a half months.The first was the entrapment operation. At the beginning, when I was arrested, I naively thought that I had made some wrong remarks during the banquet that had harmed Chen. Later, I found out that Chen had recorded our entire conversation but only showed the parts that would benefit himself.After Tsai Ing-wen ""took office"" in May 2016, some people in Taiwan's intelligence agencies wanted to show their loyalty, just like Chen. By using these methods, they could make as many ""spies"" as they wanted and needed.There were also so many loopholes during the investigation into my case. During the trial of the second instance, investigators said they did not touch my computer, which had been seized. But in May, they suddenly wanted to search it, and after that they found the so-called plan to ""develop organizations in Taiwan."" But it was only in December that they took actions to arrest the members. This was illogical. Why did they not move immediately after finding ""such important proof?"" When they searched my computer, why wasn't I or at least my lawyer there? They could have put whatever they wanted into my computer.I suffered a lot in the cell. I just got the chance to speak one or two sentences to the media when I was taken to court, and some media exposed the malpractice of the judicial organs. The court then decided to detain me and not allow me to meet anyone at the end of the trial for fear of my contact with the media.There are some words that I can use to describe my trial - unfairness and injustice. We all noticed that the trial was not open to the public, which also showed the suspicious attitude of the local authorities.Portraying me as a ""spy"" for the mainland is the political objective of the Democratic Progressive Party. Pro-independence groups in Taiwan want to hype up ""the threat of the mainland"" and the ""infiltration by the mainland"" to make an excuse for Taiwan independence. If people in Taiwan focused on ""the infiltration by the mainland,"" the Taiwan authorities would be given breathing room despite their terrible policies on the economy and other administrations. This may be their purpose, and they have to keep me in Taiwan.Why did the judge from the so-called democratic and free Taiwan release me and remind me ""to speak and act discreetly?"" Did they worry that I may say something? There is a chance that the authorities won't be happy about what I've told you and arrest me again. What kind of safety do I have now? They want to see that I'm frightened of them.I may have been persuaded to confess once, but then I refused, because if I confess to something that I did not do, the authority in Taiwan will often use this means to make so-called spies.If they are determined to make me a ""spy,"" I hope I am the last one!Global Times "	4/2/19	0	1	-0.9822	-1

"US has less cards to play in Taiwan StraitsnUS has less cards to play in Taiwan Straits US National Security Adviser John Bolton, the US State Department and the Pentagon all blamed People's Liberation Army (PLA) fighter jets for crossing the so-called ""middle line"" of the Taiwan Straits. What's ridiculous is how the US and the Tsai Ing-wen administration are continuously breaking the status quo in the Taiwan Straits, but Washington is accusing the PLA of doing that. Washington is following a wrong line in the Taiwan Straits. It is playing the Taiwan card because it regards China as a strategic rival. The US has overestimated its military power's deterrence of the mainland as well as Taiwan's wish to always serve as a US pawn. Washington has also underestimated Beijing's resolve and ability to take countermeasures. It has put itself in a dilemma. The root of the unstable cross-Straits situation is the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) refuses to accept the one-China principle and adopts policies to confront the mainland. The DPP's act is partly based on political ideals and partly on electoral tactics. But it's uncertain how long such radical policies can exist in Taiwan politics. Washington is unwise to bind its Taiwan policy to the DPP's radical line. As US warships repeatedly passed through the Taiwan Straits, why didn't they ever consider that the PLA would take countermeasures? It's Washington's blind confidence if it believes Beijing fears to act considering their relations. Although China hopes to maintain stable China-US relations in the long run, it is prepared for fiercer competition in some areas. China will not take the initiative in escalating disputes, but it will fight to protect its core interests, especially on the Taiwan question. Taiwan is close to the mainland, and the latter has abundant resources and strong strategic resolve. The US, however, should understand it doesn't have enough cards in Taiwan. Washington is choosing the wrong place, time and opponent to flex its muscle in Taiwan Straits. The PLA has many choices, including crossing the ""middle line,"" flying over the Taiwan island and even turn Taiwan into a Lebanon-like situation. These choices don't necessarily lead to war, they are enough to force Taiwan authorities to readjust their radical policies. The US is powerful, but how many choices does it have in the Taiwan Straits, except to send warships and upgrade its relations with Taiwan? If the US military returns to Taiwan, China's Anti-secession Law will be violated, and the PLA will launch a direct attack. We believe Taiwan authorities have no guts to accept the US military, because they know it will be the death knell of ""Taiwan-independence"" forces. The US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs again put forth a proposal on Taiwan on Monday. But if a military confrontation breaks out in the Taiwan Straits, the proposals will be meaningless and Taiwan's political pattern will be changed. The Taiwan Travel Act needs the coordination of radical Taiwan authorities, but this remains uncertain. Some radical Americans suggest selling more advanced aircraft to Taiwan, which is a dangerous move that breaks the status quo. The mainland will adopt stiffer countermeasures. Neither should the US overestimate the Taiwan military's loyalty. The advanced military technologies that the US sells to Taiwan will eventually come back to the mainland. Nor can US acts in the South China Sea and in the Taiwan Straits coordinate with each other. China is restrained in the South China Sea. But if the US threatens the security of China's islands, the PLA's military hardware will land on the islands overnight. The former US governments' policies toward Taiwan were basically prudent. If the current US government fails to understand the complexity of the Taiwan question and acts aggressively, it is bound to pay the price. "	4/2/19	0	1	-0.9143	-1

"Huawei’s HiSilicon to beat MediaTek as largest IC designer in Asia: reportnHuawei's IC design subsidiary HiSilicon may soon overtake Taiwan-based handset chip designer MediaTek Inc to become the largest IC designer in Asia in 2019, digitimes.com reported, citing industry sources. An industry analyst said on Tuesday that Huawei's focus on self-developed chips will help HiSiliconfurther grow, but Huawei also needs to expand its supply sources to ensure the quality of its products. The income gap between HiSilicon and MediaTek was nearly $300 million last year. HiSilicon's income rose 34.2 percent on a yearly basis in 2018 while MediaTek only secured a 0.9 percent year-on-year growth rate last year, according to recent information released by Digitimes Research. It is very likely that HiSilicon will become the largest chip designer in the industry in Asia in 2019 as Huawei attaches great importance to self-developed chips and it will increase investment in the industry based on its needs, Fu Liang, a Beijing-based independent telecom analyst, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Huawei's self-developed chips serve industries such as mobile phones, artificial intelligence, servers, routers and TVs. Huawei is using more of its own chips and cutting the share from suppliers such as Qualcomm and the ultimate goal is that in important chips, it can be self-sufficient, domestic news site finance.sina.com reported on March 20. As the US has continued to exert pressure on Huawei, the Chinese company has decided to step up the research and development (R&D) and mass production of its self-developed chips, the report said. The self-sufficiency rate of Huawei smartphones using the HiSilicon Kirin processor in the second half of 2018 was less than 40 percent, but the rate has increased to 45 percent so far this year and is forecast to reach 60 percent in the second half, according to the report. Huawei did not exclude Qualcomm, Fu said. ""Huawei will adopt HiSilicon's products if they are good enough. If not, it's possible Huawei will choose Qualcomm's."" Various supply sources will help Huawei guarantee the quality and stable development of its products, noted Fu. According to US-based research firm Gartner, Huawei increased its chip spending by 45 percent year-on-year to $21.1 billion in 2018, jumping in front of Dell and Lenovo to the third spot. Samsung Electronics and Apple ranked first and second. This year, Huawei will put 20 percent more investment than 2018 into R&D in chips as it aims to employ more of its own chips, media reports said. After releasing the world's first 7-nanometer mobile AI chipset Kirin 980 in August 2018 and Balong 5G01 modem chips in February 2018, HiSilicon is set to launch more advanced AI accelerator chips, server core processors and multimedia chip solutions in 2019, digitimes.com said. Industry insiders suggested that Huawei should increase production of its 7nm mobile AI chipset, not only for itself but also to supply other Chinese phonemakers in the country. "	4/2/19	0	0	0.9883	1

The Chinese mainland has never recognized it. Moreover, the two sides across the Straits probably have different definitions of the ""middle line."" Hence, even if PLA fighter jets did cross it, how the situation develops depends on Taiwan and US reactions. Washington has gone too far by sending warships to sail through the Straits thrice this year. Many people tended to think the PLA's move was a response to recent provocations by Taiwan and the US. If they restrain themselves, the crossing of PLA fighter jets over the ""middle line"" will be nothing serious. However, if the two continue to make provocative moves, the cross-Straits situation is bound to become more uncertain. The cross-Straits situation is complicated as three sides are involved, while the main players of the game are two of them - Beijing and Washington. Taiwan's real interest is long-term peace, which is always marginalized by the politics in the island. Some politicians in Taiwan prefer to put forward extreme policies to rival the mainland. The preconditions for such measures are peace where wars will not really break out. Taiwan authorities make people believe they fear nothing, but in fact, the island cannot withstand the cross-Straits situation going toward deep turmoil. China and the US are big countries who can afford military frictions in certain areas. But for the island, it won't be that simple. If the fighter jets of the PLA and the US Air Force have an encounter in the skies over Taiwan, it will have a strong psychological impact on Taiwan people. The mainland could also retaliate against US moves in the region. Recently, Chinese mainland scholars have been engaged in a broader discussion on how to cope with the growing provocations from the island and the US. More and more people suggest PLA fighter jets fly over the island. As cross-Straits military tensions intensify, the probability of occasional military frictions or limited military conflicts will rise. It's possible that the fighter jet will be shot down in a military clash, or PLA conducts targeted elimination at certain military base on the island that could threaten the mainland. Does this mean China is about to resolve the Taiwan question using military means? Not necessarily. A peaceful reunification is the mainland's basic policy toward the island. But it doesn't mean giving up using military forces. We don't need a real war to resolve the Taiwan question. The mainland can adopt various measures to make Taiwan ruled by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) turn into a Lebanon situation, which ""Taiwan independence"" forces cannot afford. If Washington sends wrong signals that lead to continuously escalating tensions in the region, it would be a nightmare for Taiwan authorities. If the DPP puts the island in the middle of a high-level military storm, can it sustain the rule? Once the cross-Straits crisis gets out of control, the Chinese mainland is capable of fighting to the end, while both the island and the US have something to worry about. The DPP fears that it would lose its power. Washington doesn't want to be involved in another major war and is also concerned that Taiwan people will no longer accept its support. Taiwan and the US must restrain themselves as the cross-Straits crisis has already turned into a gamble they cannot afford. "	4/1/19	0	0	-0.7381	-1

"Maps with boundary mistakes destroyednEmployees from customs authority in Qingdao, East China's Shandong Province, examine wrong maps. Photo: Courtesy of qingdaonews.com Almost 30,000 incorrect world maps, with problems including rendering Taiwan as a country and wrong depiction of the Sino-Indian border, were destroyed by the customs authorities in Qingdao, East China's Shandong Province.A total of 803 boxes of the 28,908 wrong maps were seized and destroyed, the largest amount to be disposed of in recent years, according to a news conference jointly held by the Ministry of Natural Resources, Shandong's Department of Natural Resources, Qingdao Customs and other related government agencies in Qingdao late last week, a Qingdao newspaper reported.The maps were produced by a company in East China's Anhui Province and were on the way to being exported to an unspecified foreign country.The crackdown was aimed at enhancing public awareness on national sovereignty and raising people's ability to distinguish such problematic maps, said the report.The problematic maps failed to show the correct territory of China and omitted South Tibet and the island of Taiwan, the Qingdao government found after an examination of the maps.Until now, related authorities have examined the domestic map market more than 100 times, and discovered over 10,000 incorrect maps, thus preventing them from being circulated inside the country and overseas.""What China did in the map market was absolutely legitimate and necessary, because sovereignty and territorial integrity are the most important things to a country. Both Taiwan and South Tibet are parts of China's territory which is sacred and inviolable based on the international law,"" said Liu Wenzong, professor from the department of International Law of China Foreign Affairs University.""If the wrong maps were circulated inside the country and abroad, it would have caused great harm to China's territorial integrity in the long run,"" noted Liu. ""Fortunately, China's map management regulations require authorities to strengthen supervision and regulation of activities related to maps, providing a legal foundation to prevent damage to China's national interests.""Since 2018, Qingdao has joined hands with other departments to establish an information sharing system for imported and exported maps, in order to quickly identify and take action against problematic maps.On December 14, 2015, the State Council issued a new set of regulations on maps, with the goal of tightening control over maps to safeguard state sovereignty. The regulations went into force on January 1, 2016. "	3/25/19	0	0	-0.9187	-1

"MAC apologizes for omitting Taiwan on map of China in promotional emailnMAC apologizes for omitting Taiwan on map of China in promotional email MAC Cosmetics, a New-York based cosmetics retailer under the Estee Lauder umbrella, has apologized for posting a map of China that omitted the island of Taiwan in a Women's Day promotional email campaign to US customers, saying it will resend a corrected version as soon as possible. The promotion consisted of maps of several countries with different types of make-up under the tagline ""Girl Power."" ""MAC always respects and supports the one-China policy,"" said the company on Saturday in a statement posted on its twitter-like Weibo account. MAC also said in the apology that the company will further strengthen its process management and staff training to prevent such incidents from happening. However, the claim that it ""sincerely apologizes to Chinese consumers and netizens"" and the swift responses were not enough to quash Chinese consumers' anger. Netizens said there were also omissions in the maps of other countries, such as the US map, which did not include Alaska or Hawaii. ""Can't MAC be more careful? Such a basic mistake,"" said a Weibo user named Dulianjiaolian. ""I'm Chinese first, then a consumer. Only if you respect the market can the market feed you back,"" a netizen named Mumusan posted. ""Haven't there been enough similar incidents in the past to learn from?"" a Weibo user named Yangguangshangdetaiyang posted. ""I believe that every Chinese employee at MAC is as clear as I am: No mistakes can be made on territorial questions. I hope that the (MAC) headquarters in the US can attach the same level of importance, correct the error as soon as possible, and never do it again,"" Zhang Yixing, MAC's brand spokesman in China, commented Saturday on MAC's post on Weibo. The pop artist also changed his Weibo profile image into a complete map of China. MAC is the latest of several companies that have apologized to Chinese customers. Italian fashion designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana apologized in a video on Chinese social media in November 2018 after promotional videos were seen as racist and subsequent insulting remarks made by the Instagram account of Gabbana drew public ire. US clothing retailer Gap in May 2018 apologized to China over a map on a T-shirt released in overseas markets that omitted South Tibet, the island of Taiwan and the South China Sea. ""Making mistakes first, then apologizing after a backlash,"" it's the same pattern in past similar incidents involving foreign companies, Wang Yong, an associate professor at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Sunday. No company or organization should follow this pattern any longer, whether the mistakes are intentional or not, Wang said, adding that those who want to muddy the waters should remember that there is no wiggle room at all.

"US will only hurt itself playing radical Taiwan cardnA total of 16 bipartisan US senators sent a letter to US President Donald Trump, asking him to send a cabinet-level official to Taiwan to attend an event commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act. The letter was initiated by Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Bob Menendez.Certain senators in Washington are attempting to use the Taiwan question to demonstrate their influence again. Aggressive clauses have not yet been applied by the Trump administration to enhance relations with Taiwan since the passage of the Taiwan Travel Act and Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018. It seems that the group of senators is seeking a breakthrough with this chance.The American Institute in Taiwan launched its new office in June. High-ranking US officials were expected to commemorate its opening. Nonetheless, the North Korea -US summit in Singapore captured overwhelming attention and this event was set aside with little media coverage or high-level official presence. Washington is developing its ties with the island overtly and covertly. With Congress taking the lead in passing bills, the US government is pressuring China with these acts as bargaining chips.A US cabinet-level official, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy visited Taipei to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act in 2014. Fortunately, with eased cross-Straits relations, McCarthy's trip did not result in a crisis. Mutual visits between US and Taiwan officials may touch the bottom line of the mainland, when the officials are at the cabinet level or US diplomatic and defense officials visit Taiwan or invite Taiwan ""diplomatic"" and ""defense"" officials to visit the US. These are prohibited by the principles agreed upon by China and the US when they established diplomatic ties.The Taiwan Travel Act is in open provocation with these principles. If the Trump administration implements this, Washington knows full well that it will deal a heavy blow to China-US relations. In February, a group of US senators called on Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to invite Tsai Ing-wen to address a joint meeting of Congress. The aggressive call, however, was largely considered flawed and did not catch attention.The US seems to be more willing to play the Taiwan card in a rather radical way. But such action is risky and will meet with retaliation from Beijing if it goes too far, which will in turn harm US interests. Such awareness has been playing a role in the US elite and policymaking circles.In 1995, the Senate voted 97 to 1 and the House 396 to 0 to urge then US president Bill Clinton to allow Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui to visit the US. But today the scale of those stirring up trouble around the Taiwan question in the Congress is not comparable to that of the past.It is the US political system that created decentralized power. If China concerns itself with every voice in the US, it will tire itself out by too much running around. Our resources should be focused on addressing Washington if it crosses the red line.The island is so close to the mainland that we can easily take punitive actions against collusion with the US. The Chinese mainland has struck out at Taiwan independence arrogance by sending People's Liberation Army Air Force's fighter jets to patrol around the island and implementing 31 preferential policies for Taiwan in 2018.The Democratic Progressive Party is still trying to boost its own influence by utilizing its relations with foreign forces. But relying on the US to confront the Chinese mainland will eventually not work as an election strategy. Eventually, the Taiwan question, once a major challenge to China's rise, will become history.

Mutual visits between US and Taiwan officials may touch the bottom line of the mainland, when the officials are at the cabinet level or US diplomatic and defense officials visit Taiwan or invite Taiwan ""diplomatic"" and ""defense"" officials to visit the US. These are prohibited by the principles agreed upon by China and the US when they established diplomatic ties.The Taiwan Travel Act is in open provocation with these principles. If the Trump administration implements this, Washington knows full well that it will deal a heavy blow to China-US relations. In February, a group of US senators called on Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to invite Tsai Ing-wen to address a joint meeting of Congress. The aggressive call, however, was largely considered flawed and did not catch attention.The US seems to be more willing to play the Taiwan card in a rather radical way. But such action is risky and will meet with retaliation from Beijing if it goes too far, which will in turn harm US interests. Such awareness has been playing a role in the US elite and policymaking circles.In 1995, the Senate voted 97 to 1 and the House 396 to 0 to urge then US president Bill Clinton to allow Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui to visit the US. But today the scale of those stirring up trouble around the Taiwan question in the Congress is not comparable to that of the past.It is the US political system that created decentralized power. If China concerns itself with every voice in the US, it will tire itself out by too much running around. Our resources should be focused on addressing Washington if it crosses the red line.The island is so close to the mainland that we can easily take punitive actions against collusion with the US. The Chinese mainland has struck out at Taiwan independence arrogance by sending People's Liberation Army Air Force's fighter jets to patrol around the island and implementing 31 preferential policies for Taiwan in 2018.The Democratic Progressive Party is still trying to boost its own influence by utilizing its relations with foreign forces. But relying on the US to confront the Chinese mainland will eventually not work as an election strategy. Eventually, the Taiwan question, once a major challenge to China's rise, will become history.

"Tsai’s Japan courtship will ‘fall’nTsai’s Japan courtship will ‘fall’ Tokyo unlikely to work with Taiwan on security matters: commentators Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen's ""fawning"" on Japan to win votes will ""likely fall on stony ground,"" experts noted, after Tsai brazenly claimed that she aims to ""cooperate"" with Japan on security issues. In an interview with Japanese media The Sankei Shimbun and JANPAN Forward on Thursday, Tsai said that she has asked for direct talks with the Japanese government to cooperate on cyber security and other national security issues, and that she expressed concerns over the increasing threat posed by the Chinese mainland. Japan is highly unlikely to respond to Tsai's remarks on Sino-Japanese relations heading towards a positive trend after high-level visits from both sides in 2018, Takashi Okada, a Kyodo News commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday. Japan is eagerly seeking greater cooperation with China in the economic field as it suffers from Trump's ""America First"" policy. Thus, it would be improbable for Japan to irritate China on the Taiwan question, Jin Yi, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday. The Japanese side thinks that Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je has more chances of winning the 2020 Taiwan's election, so Japan is unlikely to respond to Tsai, and would be unwise deteriorate the Sino-Japanese relationship because of the Taiwan question, Jin said. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) headed by Tsai suffered a major defeat in the ""nine-in-one"" elections on November 24, 2018. Taiwan held local elections, or nine-in-one elections, to elect representatives to nine levels of government, including mayors and councilors in November 2018. Among the 22 county and city chief posts, the Kuomintang won 15 seats, the DPP landed six, and the remaining one went to an independent candidate, the Xinhua News Agency reported, citing the island's election affairs authority. Tsai's move aims to use pro-Taiwan independence media to win votes. However, the possibility of Tsai losing the 2020 election is very high, Okada said. After the DPP became the ruling party of the island in 2016, cross-Straits relations have been volatile since the DPP refuses to recognize the 1992 Consensus - which embodies the one-China principle, and has pushed for ""desinicization."" What the DPP has done in recent years has failed the residents of Taiwan and caused strong discontent, Yang Lixian, a specially-appointed research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center on Cross-Straits Relations, told the Global Times previously. He said that the DPP's restrictions on cross-Straits exchanges in all fields, including trade, have affected the livelihood of the island's residents and failed to improve the island's economic development.

"At the MWC, I feel struggles of Taiwan telecom operatorsnAttendees at Chunghwa Telecom at the Mobile World Conference Photo: Chen Qingqing/GT Nowadays, 5G, the most promising technology for a connected world, has become a sensational topic on the island of Taiwan. In recent talks with a senior executive from the largest local telecoms carrier, Chunghwa Telecom (CHT), at the Mobile World Conference (MWC) in Barcelona, I got to know the company's struggles to catch up in technology amid a political dilemma.At the industry's largest event, CHT's display was subdued. On the MWC's official website, the firm is described as one of the largest carriers in Asia in terms of revenue. It has also been active at this annual gathering, having selected telecoms equipment provider Ericsson to accelerate Internet of Things development on Tuesday.Due to political pressure on the island, CHT had to choose Nokia and Ericsson as potential providers of equipment to build the next generation of wireless networks.CHT and Nokia plan to jointly build a 5G trial network at designated sites in 2018 and 2019 to meet their goal of launching a pre-commercial 5G network in 2020, the company said in an earlier statement.I was curious about its ambitions in 5G deployment on the island, especially after it had chosen European equipment providers that are more expensive than systems provided by vendors in the Chinese mainland.When I approached CHT, a company employee was introducing its 5G plan in Taoyuan county, including how to help local authorities gather data in the food, transportation, and industry management sectors and analyze it efficiently.When I asked for an interview as a journalist from the mainland, it seemed that CHT was initially reluctant to accept. This came as no surprise, because even before the MWC had kicked off, the island had protested because MWC's official website had referred to the island as part of China.Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen's leadership has worsened cross-Straits relations by using political pressure to discourage companies from the island from interacting with their counterparts in the mainland. I understood why they were unwilling to talk with me.Still, CHT found someone in charge of research and development, rather than corporate strategy, to talk with me for a few minutes, only focusing on the technical matters.This technician was very patient and explained possible 5G solutions and use cases, the current situation for 5G infrastructure on the island and the status of 5G base station deployment.I have traveled to the island twice, and I know that Taiwan had gained experience in developing its telecoms industry since the 1990s. In 2001, the island had 2,180 households that owned mobile phones. I was wondering if the island will also lead ahead in the 5G era.He did not seem to think so. As the market has matured with fierce competition, telecoms carriers see limited profit margins. Current mobile fees with unlimited data packages are not expensive. Consumers are unlikely to pay more for an upgraded mobile service, the technician said.In terms of 5G deployment, I asked him whether the selection of Ericsson and Nokia meant exclusion of Huawei, which has seen thousands of shipments of 5G base stations to its customers.""It's too sensitive,"" he said. He was not even willing to comment on Huawei's 5G technology from a technician's perspective.The MWC should be an event where industry representatives exchange their opinions on technological advancement, but political pressure loomed when they mentioned Huawei.I mentioned some statistics, such as the fact that Huawei's equipment could lower costs by at least 40 percent, as well as the fact that the company is the leader in 5G deployment. The technician from CHT did not deny this.Surprisingly, he said he hopes Huawei can take as much market share as possible so that maybe other equipment providers will have to lower the prices of their products.

However, Chinese mainland netizens responded widely that the Taiwan authorities' opposition is invalid.This year's MWC will start on Monday in Spain.

"US plays Taiwan card to contain China: expertsnUS plays Taiwan card to contain China: experts A top US Navy officer's visit to China includes a stop in Nanjing, East China's Jiangsu Province, which Chinese analysts believe is a sign that the US is highlighting the island of Taiwan in its military talks with China. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson began his visit on Sunday. After meeting Chinese navy commander Shen Jinlong and leaders of China's Central Military Commission in Beijing, Richardson will also visit Nanjing, which is the headquarters of China's Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army. Richardson tweeted on Monday that he and Shen ""completed a constructive and candid discussion, an ongoing dialogue we are both committed to continuing. Our two countries have many aligned interests and all countries benefit from a free, open and secure Indo-Pacific."" Richardson's visit to Nanjing is seen by many Chinese experts as a sign that the South China Sea issue and Taiwan Island are significant points that the US wants to discuss in this round of military talks, as most military frictions between China and the US happened at sea. Ni Feng, a deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of American Studies, told the Global Times that the US has been using the island of Taiwan as a strategic leverage to contain China. ""Since the US considers China a strategic competitor, the military has been one of its measures to contain China,"" Ni said. The US Navy's Pacific Fleet drew a classified proposal to carry out a series of operations in the Taiwan Straits as well as the South China Sea, US media reported in October. ""Although this did not happen after negotiations between the two sides, the US continues testing China's bottom line by provocative actions,"" Ni noted. China should not assume that the US would reduce its activities in the South China Sea and stop selling weapons to Taiwan, experts warned, noting that China should clarify its bottom line in case the US misjudged it. Peng Guangqian, a major general and strategist at China's Academy of Military Sciences, noted that the Taiwan Straits is China's strategic interest and ""we have made this point clear at previous bilateral talks."" ""Both the Taiwan Straits and South China Sea will be covered during Richardson's visit, and the important thing is finding out whether the US is serious about the talks,"" Peng said.

"‘Taiwan independence’ separatists to be classified war criminals: PLA generaln‘Taiwan independence’ separatists to be classified war criminals: PLA general The very few ""Taiwan-independence"" separatists would be classified as war criminals that must be punished if the Chinese mainland is forced to deal with the Taiwan question by force, a People's Liberation Army (PLA) general said on Wednesday. Lieutenant General He Lei, former vice-president of the Academy of Military Science of the PLA, made the remarks at a press conference of the State Council Information Office. ""I believe that the 'Taiwan-independence' separatists have no capability or means to separate the island from the mainland even they have the nerve to do so, as China's 1.3 billion people including the Taiwan compatriots will by no means tolerate it,"" He said. He urged the ""Taiwan-independence"" separatists to pull back before it is too late, otherwise they would be the ""chief culprits"" that must be punished by the mainland in resolving the Taiwan question by force. Some foreign forces that wish to interfere in China's internal affairs and play the role of ""world police"" will also be the ""chief culprits,"" He said. We sincerely hope that there will be no military conflict across the Taiwan Straits, and the PLA will prepare for any possible military conflict at any time, He said. ""We don't want any country to be foreign forces, but we are not afraid of it. The PLA has the resolve, confidence, capability and means to firmly safeguard the national sovereignty and security,"" He said. He made the remarks after Chinese President Xi Jinping's speech at a gathering in Beijing to commemorate the 40th anniversary of issuing the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan on January 2. ""We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means,"" Xi said. This does not target compatriots in Taiwan, but the interference of external forces and the very small number of ""Taiwan independence"" separatists and their activities, according to Xi.

The process won't take too long, because we Chinese people are wise and able. The two sides see close civil and economic interactions despite the current hostile status. Once the hostility ends, and Taiwan refuses to be a chess piece of the US, the two sides will integrate after three decades. Once the barrier is removed, how can politicians cut the blood relationship that has lasted for 5,000 years? GT: Is there any similarity between your politics and the ""Once country, two systems"" proposed at a gathering to commemorate the 40th anniversary of issuing the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan? How do you comment about the Tsai administration's response? Chang: ""One country, two systems"" is an innovative proposal and worth deliberation. However, the DPP maliciously misinforms the people, criticizing the proposal indiscriminately. Some people in the blue camp dare not to give an active response to the proposal for fear of the US. Tsai has a rather low support rate currently, there is no way for her to abandon ""Taiwan independence."" GT: You said that for both the blue camp and green camp, it is hard to get rid of the influence of the US once taking power. Will you be an exception if you win the election? Chang: I will definitely be an exception. Taiwan can maintain peace with the mainland while keeping a good relationship with the US. However, it doesn't mean that Taiwan has to be a card played by the US. Shaking off control of the US needs cooperation from the mainland. The US will surely not be happy to see the signing of a cross-Straits peace agreement. However, it depends on the will of the both sides, and it depends on how the Taiwan leader persuades the people. If I become the leader, I am able to and will make efforts to realize it. GT: Do you think you will be a ""dark horse"" even though the outside world holds a negative opinion? Chang: I believe I will be a ""dark horse."" Quite a few people think that I am nothing but a professor without political experience. The fact is that I have been participating in work involving elections since 1996. I drafted policies for Mr. Chen Li-an in the 1990s when Taiwan had its first direct leader election. After 2000, I organized and participated in a series of social movements and established an association to promote cross-Straits peace and integration. I know about the mainland as well as Taiwan, and I have knowledge on international law and politics. In the meantime, I am willing to make excellent plans, becoming a good communicator across the Straits. I am not merely an academician, I am a practitioner of social affairs. Honestly, it does not completely depend on me to win the election, but on the resolution of the Taiwan society. What I need to do is to awaken the resolution. "	1/8/19	0	0	0.9925	1
"Big data tech helps 101 Taiwan veterans find mainland relativesn A 97-year-old veteran from the island of Taiwan pays his respects to his parents in Luzhou, Southwest China's Sichuan Province in April 2017. Photo: Courtesy of Jinri Toutiao More than 100 veterans in the island of Taiwan have found their relatives in the Chinese mainland with the assistance of big data analysis technology. Liu Yaliang, director of the ""Finding missing relatives"" initiated by Jinri Toutiao, one of China's most popular social media platforms, told the Global Times on Sunday that the project has helped 101 Taiwan's veterans find their hometowns in the mainland, with the oldest one being 100 years old. Liu said one of the veterans has been separated from his relatives in the mainland for 80 years. In 1949, the Kuomintang (KMT) Party led by Chiang Kai-shek was defeated in a civil war by the Communist Party of China, which later founded the People's Republic of China. Many KMT members fled to Taiwan in the aftermath of the conflict, causing many families to be split up. According to the company, it first utilized its location database to pinpoint veterans' hometowns and then sent messages to the region's users who have installed the application to spread the information. In March 2017, the first veteran who found his hometown was Hu Dingyuan, 97, whose relatives are living in Luzhou, Southwest China's Sichuan Province. After reading the message, a journalist from the Chengdu Business Daily voluntarily went to Luzhou and found Hu's relatives who had lost touch with Hu for 77 years on April 10. ""These veterans came back immediately after finding their hometowns and relatives in the mainland through the platform,"" Liu said. She said these soldiers ""worshiped their parents and had a family reunion dinner with folks and relatives."" ""When departure, most of the veterans chose to take back a bottle of homeland soil to Taiwan,"" Liu added. ""Occasionally, a deceased veteran's descendant would bring his bone ashes and place them in the family graveyard."" The project was officially launched in December 2017 following a nine-month trial, and is supported by the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, Liu said. "	1/6/19	0	0	0.7264	1
"Scholars see 3 ways to realize reunification with TaiwannA gathering to commemorate the 40th anniversary of issuing ""Message to Compatriots in Taiwan"" is held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Wednesday. Photo: Xinhua Chinese scholars predicted on Thursday that there will be three major ways to realize the reunification of the island of Taiwan with the Chinese mainland - war, peaceful negotiation and brinkmanship without actual violence, with brinkmanship the most likely option regarding the current situation across the Taiwan Straits. President Xi Jinping's remarks on Wednesday at a gathering in Beijing to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the issuing of a ""Message to Compatriots in Taiwan"" have delivered a strong message announcing the mainland's determination and sincerity regarding the peaceful reunification of the country. He stressed that ""peaceful reunification"" and ""one country, two systems"" have proved to be the best path to achieve the goal of national reunification, the Xinhua News Agency reported. The message has triggered heated discussion among scholars across the Straits on realistic measures to realize reunification. Li Fei, a professor with the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Thursday that ""peaceful reunification through political negotiation is the priority for sure, even if its probability is not high at all, because the cost and return risks are minimal."" The mainland has surpassed the island of Taiwan in many fields and is getting more and more attractive to ordinary people from the island, not only business persons, but also the youth, including students and young job seekers. Therefore, building mutual understanding and improving integration for the people from both sides is just a matter of time, and the mainland has confidence and patience, but now the major problem is that the political exchange is at a deadlock, analysts from the mainland noted. Not only the exchange and communication between the two peoples, but reunification also requires Taiwan to have a strong political party to represent the majority of Taiwan compatriots and accept the reunification rather than wavering between independence and maintaining the status quo, Li said. Unfortunately, there is no such party in Taiwan at this moment, said Chang Ya-chung, a professor from the Department of Political Science at National Taiwan University. ""At least before 2020 [the 'general election' year of the island], Taiwan's political structure will remain divided,"" Chang noted. Currently, the pro-independence ruling party of the island, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), has actively refused the initiative from the mainland on Wednesday. After experiencing failure in a series of ""regional elections"" in the island in November 2018, the DPP has lost control in most cities and countries on the island, and the political structure of the island will face reconfiguration in 2020. Xi proposed on Wednesday that political parties, and all sectors on both sides of the Straits, may recommend representatives to conduct extensive and in-depth democratic consultation on the basis of the common political foundation of upholding the 1992 Consensus and opposing ""Taiwan independence."" ""The purpose is much greater than influencing one or two elections, but to lay a political foundation for the political exchange for all parties in the island, and also exclude the separatist groups like the DPP from future negotiations,"" said Song Luzheng, an analyst of Taiwan affairs and a research fellow at the China Institute of Fudan University in Shanghai. ""The people who support peaceful unification in Taiwan welcome Xi's initiative since it calls for negotiation and consultation, and the mainland is willing to discuss the 'two system' arrangement, and after the political exchange restarts in the future, we hope the two sides can enlighten each other to find more creative and innovative ideas,"" Chang said. Foreign forces, military solution The ideal way for peaceful reunification is that pro-reunification parties in the island can regain power in 2020 and kick off negotiations with the mainland, Song noted. ""Both sides need to reach an agreement on the way and time for reunification first, and then they need to realize it step by step, and prevent the interruption from separatists, proxies controlled by foreign forces, and other countries that don't want to see a reunified China. Chang, as a scholar from Taiwan, warned that ""even the KMT [Chinese Kuomintang Party in Taiwan, which acknowledges the 1992 Consensus], which is accepted by the mainland as a negotiator, will be reluctant to touch the reunification issue should it come to power, because it cannot get rid of the influence from the US."" ""If the peaceful solution fails, the solution of brinkmanship that combines political efforts and military pressures will be used,"" Li from Xiamen University echoed. Brinkmanship is the practice of trying to achieve the reunification outcome by pushing the situation to the brink of active military conflict, he said. Jin Canrong, associate dean of Renmin University of China's School of International Studies, told the Global Times on Thursday that there is a successful example of brinksmanship in history - the peaceful liberation of Beiping in 1949 (Beiping is the old name of Beijing before 1949). In this case, KMT forces in Beiping surrendered under heavy military pressure from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the joint efforts from both sides kept the city from being destroyed by war. Li said that this kind of solution is the most likely, and it will take place when the sincere initiative for a peaceful solution proposed by the mainland has been refused by all parties on the island and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has the overwhelming military advantage in the region that can ensure victory against any kind of intervention from any country, especially the US. Xi said in his Wednesday's speech that ""the reunification of the country is the inevitable requirement for national rejuvenation."" Worst solution Another danger is from the US' behavior of challenging the one-China principle, Jin noted. ""In 2018, the US decided to have frictions with China on trade issues, and if it shifts the conflict zone from trade to the Taiwan question, it will bring huge crisis as well. After losing power in most regions of the island, the DPP has started to embrace extreme separatists and the conservative forces of the US. This is a dangerous signal that the mainland should be worried about,"" he said. The latest incident that proved this kind of concern is that the DPP welcomed the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, approved by the US Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump in December, which allows arms sales and high-level visits by the two sides. Li said that if China is forced to solve the Taiwan question in the near future, then this would be the worst option for reunification, and this one will only happen when the hope of peaceful reunification has totally perished. Observers noted that under this condition, the mainland must launch the preemptive offensive even if an absolute military advantage in the region is not fully realized yet, because Taiwan would have activated article 8 of China's Anti-Secession Law. The cost and sacrifices might be huge if the US decides to launch a military intervention. According to article 8 of the law, ""In the event that the 'Taiwan independence' secessionist forces should act under any name or by any means to cause the fact of Taiwan's secession from China, or that major incidents entailing Taiwan's secession from China should occur, or that possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted, the state shall employ non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity."" The parties on the island need to be aware that if reunification is realized by war, there will be no ""one country, two systems,"" because then reunification will be no different from other Chinese provinces the PLA had liberated in the mainland in the past, Li noted.

"Xi charts course for peaceful reunificationn Illustration: Liu Rui/GT Chinese President Xi Jinping, also the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, expounded on the connotation of Chinese mainland's basic policy on Taiwan in the new era in remarks to commemorate the 40th anniversary of issuing the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan. Xi, whose remarks are of historical significance, charted the course of development of cross-Straits relations. The speech can serve both as a proclamation for advancing China's peaceful reunification in the new era, and as a road map for achieving such a great cause with concerted efforts of both sides of the Taiwan Straits. Declaring the resolve of the Chinese mainland in its pursuit of peaceful reunification, Xi emphasized that cross-Straits reunification is the trend of history and that the Taiwan question originated from national weakness and disorder, and will definitely end with national rejuvenation. In other words, the Taiwan question is bound to be resolved and China's peaceful reunification is bound to be achieved during national rejuvenation. This is a response to the world's question on when the Taiwan question will be resolved. Xi was particular in pointing out that ""Taiwan independence"" goes against the trend of history and will lead to a dead end. The mainland is willing to create space for peaceful reunification, but will leave no room for separatist activities. Therefore, it does not rule out force and reserves the option of using all means against external forces and a bunch of ""Taiwan independence"" separatists. Although the mainland upholds the policy of peaceful reunification, it will never exclude the possibility of resorting to the Anti-Secession Law if the ""Taiwan independence"" activists continue to promote separatism, and if foreign forces headed by the US interfere in cross-Straits affairs. Xi reiterated that the Taiwan question is China's internal affairs. It bears on China's core interests and Beijing will brook no foreign interference. In addition, China's reunification will not harm the interests of other countries including their economic activities in Taiwan, but will only bring them more opportunities for development. In 2018, US President Donald Trump played the Taiwan card more actively. Trump's policy will not affect the pace of reunification and will do more harm to the interests of US and other foreign forces. In his speech, Xi emphasized the future course of cross-Straits relations. He called on all the compatriots in Taiwan to treasure peace, and said that the principles of ""peaceful reunification"" and ""one country, two systems"" are the best approach to realizing national reunification. He also called on to uphold the one-China policy and deepen the integrated development across the Taiwan Straits to consolidate the foundation of peaceful reunification. The most important policy innovation is to explore the concept of ""one country, two systems"" for Taiwan. ""Peaceful reunification"" and ""one country, two systems"" are the guiding principles to resolve the Taiwan question after the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan was issued in 1979, and first implemented in Hong Kong and Macao. Beijing needs to study the approach to the Taiwan question under ""one country, two systems."" For implementing the concept, the current conditions in Taiwan, opinion of all walks of life across the Taiwan Straits as well as feelings of the Taiwan compatriots will be taken into consideration. The social system and way of life of the Taiwan island will be fully respected and private property, religious beliefs and legitimate rights and interests of Taiwan compatriots will be protected after peaceful reunification is achieved. Xi's statement can be regarded as the core guiding principle of the ""Taiwan approach."" Xi also pointed out that the long-standing political differences cannot be dragged on generation after generation. Xi proposed that political parties and all sectors on both sides of the Straits may recommend representatives to conduct extensive and in-depth democratic consultation on cross-Straits relations and the future of the nation, and establish institutional arrangement for peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, on the basis of the common political foundation of upholding the 1992 Consensus and opposing ""Taiwan independence."" Xi had made a similar proposal on cross-Straits ties in a meeting with Vincent Siew of Taiwan in 2013. Political dialogue with the island is a highly sensitive issue. The time for resolving the conflict through talks has come after there was no fruitful discussion during the period of cooperation between 2008 and 2016. As long as the institutional arrangement for peaceful development of relations is made, the road to China's reunification will not be far.

"Xi speech shifts Taiwan focus from stability to reunificationn President Xi Jinping delivers a speech during an event to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the issuing of a ""Message to Compatriots in Taiwan"" at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Wednesday. Photo: Xinhua President Xi Jinping proposed that the Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan should conduct democratic consultation on cross-Straits relations and the future of the nation, and explore the plan of ""two systems"" for the island as well as establishing an institutional arrangement for peaceful development of cross-Strait relations. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks at a gathering in Beijing to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the issuing of a ""Message to Compatriots in Taiwan."" Analysts noted that Xi's speech marked a change in focus by the Chinese mainland from maintaining stability across the Taiwan Straits to actively promoting the reunification of the country with a road map. The message issued 40 years ago ended the military confrontation and hostile relationship between the two sides and initiated peaceful reunification, and Xi's speech stressed that ""peaceful reunification and the 'one country two systems' are the best way to realize the reunification of the country,"" the Xinhua News Agency reported. The Taiwan question originated from national weakness and disorder, and will definitely end with national rejuvenation, and the reunification of the country is the inevitable requirement for national rejuvenation, Xi said, according to Xinhua. Forty years ago, the mainland had no capability to guide and control the direction of the cross-Straits relationship, analysts noted, but now the mainland can more confidently and powerfully set the agenda for a future solution to the Taiwan question. That is why at this time the mainland has decided to change its focus and push more actively for reunification, they noted. Political parties and all sectors on both sides of the Straits may recommend representatives to conduct extensive and in-depth democratic consultation on the basis of the common political foundation of upholding the 1992 Consensus and opposing ""Taiwan independence,"" Xi said. Yu Keli, director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Taiwan Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Wednesday that Xi's speech was ""a consistent stance of the mainland, and the reason the mainland initiated the establishment of an institutional arrangement was to break the current political deadlock across the Straits."" Exchanges, cooperation and communications are already taking place between peoples on the two sides. Mainland experts assert that Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the pro-separatist party ""ruling"" the island province, is standing in the way of further political progress. The DPP refuses to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus, causing a deadlock in political exchanges and consultations across the Straits. The 1992 Consensus reached in Singapore states that both sides recognize only one China and both the Chinese mainland and Taiwan belong to the same China. The agreement simply known as the 1992 Consensus enabled exchanges between people on both sides of the Straits to flourish, until the DPP came to power in 2000 and again in 2016. In his speech, Xi stressed that achieving national rejuvenation and cross-Straits reunification is the trend of history, which can never be blocked by anyone or any force. ""China must be and will be reunified."" ""We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means."" This does not target compatriots in Taiwan, but the interference of external forces and the very small number of ""Taiwan independence"" separatists and their activities, Xi noted. ""Taiwan independence"" goes against the trend of history and will lead to a dead end, Xi said. Yu said that ""this is a clear signal to political groups within the island of Taiwan that maintaining the status quo is not the final goal for cross-Straits relations, and future development of relations should be oriented by reunification."" In the past ""the foundation for cross-Straits exchange was always hit and shaken by the transition of power on the island. When Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] came to power for example, the achievements reached with the KMT [Chinese Kuomintang Party in Taiwan, which acknowledges the 1992 Consensus] were negated,"" said Song Luzheng, an analyst of Taiwan affairs and a research fellow at the China Institute of Fudan University in Shanghai. Some KMT politicians during former leader Ma Ying-jeou's tenure also refused to promote reunification and stuck to the status quo, Song said. This is also part of the deadlock, and the deadlock should not be accepted forever, Song noted, and that's why Xi called for the establishment of an institutional arrangement, ""which will not be impacted by power transitions within the island."" Post-reunification era The practice of peaceful reunification and the plan for ""two systems"" on the island should be explored, Xi said. Xi's speech on Wednesday was consistent with the 1979 ""Message to Compatriots in Taiwan,"" Yu said. Taiwan will be guaranteed lasting peace after peaceful reunification, Xi said at the gathering. On the basis of ensuring China's sovereignty, security and development interests, Taiwan's social system and way of life will be fully respected, and the private property, religious beliefs and legitimate rights and interests of Taiwan compatriots will be fully protected after peaceful reunification is realized, Xi said. ""We are all of the same family. The cross-Straits affairs are domestic affairs and should naturally be addressed through discussion and consultation by ourselves,"" Xi said. Yu said this shows that the mainland has already started to consider the arrangement for the post-reunification era and all cooperation, consultations or negotiations between the two sides of the Straits should be oriented toward reunification. ""The peaceful development of the cross-Straits relationship could only be meaningful when it is oriented toward reunification,"" Yu said. Chinese people's affairs should be decided by the Chinese people, Xi said, stressing that the Taiwan question concerns China's core interests and the national bond of the Chinese people. China's reunification does not harm any country's legitimate interests, including their economic interests, in Taiwan, Xi said. It will only bring more development opportunities to other countries, inject more positive energy into the prosperity and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the world, and make greater contributions to building a community with a shared future for humanity, to world peace and development, and to the cause of human progress, he said. Impact on island A series of ""regional elections"" within the island in November 2018 brought huge losses to the DPP, while the KMT party, which acknowledges the 1992 Consensus, has regained control of many counties and cities in the island. The ""general election"" of the leader in the island will take place in 2020, and at the moment major political parties and their politicians within the island are preparing for the general election next year. Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the island, responded negatively to Xi's speech and initiative, saying her administration refuses to accept the 1992 Consensus and opposes one country, two systems, Taiwan-based chinatimes.com reported. Chen Xiancai, a professor with the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Wednesday that ""Tsai's response is very unwise and she is picking a dead-end. The people's will within the island has already given the DPP a lesson in November, but it seems like Tsai didn't learn and decided to embrace the DPP's most extreme and radical supporters: the separatists."" Currently the approval ratings for the KMT and nonparty group who control Taipei, which accept ""the two sides of the Straits are family,"" are rising while the DPP's are dropping. ""The DPP is not that important, and the core mission for the mainland is to gain support and get connected with the ordinary people. The separatists in the island will be abandoned by the Taiwan compatriots eventually. Probably just one year later in 2020's 'general election.'"" "	1/2/19	0	0	0.9993	1
"A road map for peaceful reunificationnA road map for peaceful reunification Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed on Wednesday that China must be and will be reunified. He called for ""one country, two systems"" in Taiwan and enrichment of the reunification process. Xi made the milestone remarks at a gathering to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the ""Message to Compatriots in Taiwan."" Xi's words put forward a systematic road map for peaceful reunification, including innovative suggestions and specific arrangements in five major aspects. At the end of 2018, US President Donald Trump signed the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018 which aims to elevate mutual visits between Washington and the island. At the beginning of 2019, Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen delivered a proposition similar to ""one country on each side."" But they were only pursuing short-term personal and party political interests. Taiwan's situation is complicated. The Chinese mainland has dominance and initiative over it. The US and Taiwan are upgrading their so-called relationship and Taiwan authorities are making radical statements. But on the other hand, the Chinese mainland is implementing policies to promote reunification. People will understand the future of the Taiwan Straits only after knowing the general trend. Xi said that the Taiwan question originated from national weakness, and will definitely end with national rejuvenation. Indeed, cross-Straits reunification is the trend of history that can never be blocked. If the Chinese mainland was determined to resort to force, the Taiwan question would have ended long ago. Peaceful reunification is based on goodwill, and it has turned into solid confidence and specific policies as the Chinese mainland strengthens its power. Today peaceful reunification is already on its way. Peaceful reunification makes ""Taiwan independence"" impossible, not to mention that the Chinese mainland could resolve the Taiwan question in hours with the use of force. ""Taiwan independence"" is losing attraction for most Taiwan people as it is costing more money. It has become an extreme game that only caters to Taiwan's political system. Peaceful reunification is unstoppable. Taiwan authorities used to decide how to handle the Chinese mainland. But today, Taiwan's county and city governments can improve their ties with the mainland, and Taiwan's enterprises can develop in the mainland. People-to-people exchanges across the Taiwan Straits greatly advanced in 2018. Taiwan people are Chinese people. Huge realistic interests will reinforce such an understanding. It's hard for those who oppose peaceful reunification to deceive people and maintain power in the long run. Instead of an arduous struggle, peaceful reunification is a natural and unstoppable result of the Chinese nation's great rejuvenation. Peaceful reunification was a new route when first proposed by the mainland 40 years ago. Today it is a realistic prospect. Xi's remarks may shock Taiwan authorities' fragile mentality. But Taiwan should face these frank words at the crucial historical juncture, not escape from reality. Taiwan will be keeping up with the tide of history when ""Taiwan independence"" is abandoned by Taiwan's mainstream politics. That day will come very soon. "	1/2/19	0	0	0.9975	1

"Reunification of the country is only a matter of time: observern Students from the mainland and Taiwan play games at a youth festival in Fuzhou, Fujian Province. Photo: VCG The reunification of Taiwan with China is only a matter of time and the island will receive a ""destructive impact"" if it acts with hostility against the Chinese mainland, mainland analysts said on Tuesday, the 40th anniversary of the publication of an ""Open Letter to Taiwan Compatriots."" To commemorate the letter's anniversary, Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, will attend a gathering event scheduled for Wednesday morning at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, and will deliver a speech at the gathering, to be held at 10 am, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Monday. Issued January 1, 1979 by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the open letter initiated a cross-Straits development path oriented by peaceful reunification, and suggested to stop military confrontation and kick off exchanges among the people. After the letter issued, these proposals have been realized. Over the past 40 years, the stalemate between the two sides of the Straits has been broken and cooperation and exchanges have benefited peoples across the Straits, analysts noted. In the 1992 Consensus reached in Singapore, both sides recognized there is only one China and both the Chinese mainland and Taiwan belong to the same China. Through this consensus, exchanges were boosted between peoples across the Straits, but relations also saw tension when Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came to power in 2000 and again in 2016. A ""regional election"" on the island in November brought huge losses to the pro-independence DPP, which became the ruling party in 2016. The Chinese Kuomintang (KMT) party, which acknowledges the 1992 Consensus, has regained control of many counties and cities in the island of Taiwan. But this won't change the DPP administration's denial of the consensus and the DPP is likely to boost their efforts against the Chinese mainland in 2019, Yang Lixian, a research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center of Cross-Straits Relations, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The new year speech delivered by Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen on Tuesday also signaled a tough stance toward the mainland, warning against continued ""threats,"" Bloomberg reported. The DPP administration welcomed the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, approved by the US Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump in December, that allows arm sales and high-level visits by the two sides. Zhang Hua, assistant research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the US should stop using Taiwan to interrupt the China-US relationship, and that the behavior of the Tsai administration in pandering to the US will harm the interests of the people on the island. Observers from the mainland said that if the DPP takes its own course and goes against the mainland, it will spark an intense military crisis, and whether the conflict takes place between the two sides of the Straits or between China and the US, the island will be the first to receive the destructive impact. Yang asserted that ""as long as the Chinese mainland is developing, the goal of reunification is foreseeable. It is only a matter of time."" Reunification is likely to happen before 2035, Zhang predicted. Welcome home Based on the 1992 Consensus and open letter, the mainland has implemented various measures in recent years aimed at sharing the fruits of mainland development with Taiwan compatriots. Zheng Boyu, 31, from Taiwan, manager of Beijing-based Vstartup Station of Taiwan, an institution helping Taiwan youth apply to mainland universities and gain internships in firms based in the mainland, told the Global Times on Tuesday, ""After 40 years, many young people from Taiwan, including me, are still enjoying the benefits that came from the open letter in education and career development."" Zheng hoped a new generation of Taiwan people will benefit from closer cross-Straits relations. ""Taiwan teenagers are willing to contribute to the development of the mainland and the reunification of China,"" Zheng said. ""Although the DPP will add more difficulties to normal exchanges between people in 2019, more teenagers from the island will decide to vote with their feet [travel, study and work in the mainland]."" Sixty local governments in 22 provincial-level regions on the Chinese mainland have tailored measures to implement preferential policies for Taiwan compatriots in industry, finance and taxation, land use, employment, education and healthcare, Xinhua reported on December 26, citing the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, China's cabinet.

"Taiwan leader Tsai’s claim of mainland pressure slammed as ‘groundless hype’nTaiwan leader Tsai’s claim of mainland pressure slammed as ‘groundless hype’ Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen's accusations that the Chinese mainland is using its political pressure to tame companies from the island have been slammed as ""groundless hype"", and her comments would further worsen cross-Straits relations. Tsai, also head of the ""pro-independence"" Democratic Progressive Party that currently holds office in the island, made the comments on Tuesday amid wide debate over an incident involving Wu Pao-chun, a renowned baker from Taiwan, who openly identified himself as a ""Chinese"" on Sina Weibo on Monday. Wu, who opened a bakery in Shanghai last Friday, said in the statement that he is proud to be Chinese. Wu claimed himself as a Chinese person from Taiwan who insisted that ""the people across the Strait are family."" Wu also denied he had ever released any pro-independence comments and expressed his firm support for and recognition of the 1992 Consensus, according to the statement. The 1992 Consensus is an agreement reached between the mainland and Taiwan in 1992 to adhere to the one-China principle. Taiwan News reported that during an interview in 2016, Wu said that over the years, many investors from around the world had invited him to open bakeries overseas. Some of the investors were from the mainland, but Wu remained unmoved by their offers. ""China has a market of 1.3 billion people, but the whole world has more than 7 billion people, so I won't just look to China."" Wu has since been labeled as pro-independence by numerous mainland customers. Wu's statement right after his business opened in Shanghai was deemed by some Taiwan net users as a ""two-faced businessman's behavior,"" before it was interpreted by Tsai as evidence to justify her accusation against the Chinese mainland. At a news conference on Tuesday with Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu, Wu said, ""The world of bread is simple and happy. I am a very simple baker."" The mayor also called Taiwan people to support Wu, Taiwan-based news site ETtoday reported. Analysts reached by the Global Times on Tuesday said Tsai's remarks only deteriorated cross-Straits relations. There is no such thing as ""choosing sides"" before Tsai's administration, which has been against the 1992 Consensus. Tsai must understand that while the mainland government encourages Taiwan enterprises to start businesses here, they have to pass the scrutiny of mainland people, who won't allow the coexistence of ""Taiwan independence"" and ""earning profits in mainland,"" Zhu Songling, a professor at the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Beijing Union University, told the Global Times.

"China-US relations heading toward uncharted waters dominate Global Times annual conferencenScholars attended the Global Times Annual Event in Beijing on Saturday. Photos: Li Hao, Cui Meng/GT Editor's Note: The Global Times Annual Event was held on Saturday in Beijing, attended by dozens of scholars and experts in various fields. This year's theme was ""The Game between China and the US and the Situation of the World."" Participants shared their views on China-US ties and key issues of 2018 and made their predications for the future. How will the China-US ties go in the future? Yang Yi, rear admiral and former director of the National Defense University's Institute for Strategic Studies I am worried about the prospect of China-US relations because now they are at a significant and dangerous crossroads. First, the strategic aims of China and the US are at odds. China wants to achieve national rejuvenation and the US wants to make itself great again. Both of them think the other wants to hurt them. Second, the US is offensive, while China is defensive. The anxiety of the US made it take irrational actions in its general strategy. China hopes to maintain a stable relationship with the US. Third, it is possible that the interactions between China and the US fall into a vicious circle and become uncontrollable. An unexpected strategy may bring about unpleasant compromises. Zhang Yiwu, professor at Peking University China has already become very significant for the US in terms of changing the US view of culture, concepts, and more importantly the world. China and the US have many differences in their culture, ideas and goals. These differences could be resolved, but the US doesn't want to find common ground. China's well-meaning actions, such as establishing the Confucius Institute in the US to promote Chinese language, have become disputed topics. I believe as long as the two countries sour on the cultural level, their social, economic and political relations will sour as well. This is the problem that we are going to face in 2019. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China I would say the result of China-US trade friction would be win-win. Why? The US hopes China could open its investment and trade market, which is in fact good for China's economy. In history, when China opened up its economy, it became more advanced. As a result, opening China's market is good for itself. Meanwhile, it is also good for the US. Nowadays, many American companies think the current platform is unfair. They said the economic relationship between the two countries are unequal and without peer intervention. Yang Xiyu, senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies I personally pay high attention on the ""90 days"" [referred to by US President Donald Trump as a period in which trade disputes should be resolved]. If China and the US can reach an agreement, it will be a new start not only for China-US relations, but also for China's further reform and opening-up. Beyond a China-US trade war, problems about China's market and the county's negative list should be resolved. As a result, be it 90 days, or 120 days, the current trade truce between Beijing and Washington will lead to a new agreement with structural changes. It will build pressure on China for further reform and opening-up. I think the agreement after 90 days or a little bit longer is very significant to stabilize China-US relations. What lies ahead the South China Sea issue and the Taiwan question? Zhu Feng, executive director at the China Center for Collaborative Studies of the South China Sea and dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University The US is militarizing the South China Sea more than China. It conducted ""free navigations"" in the region - four times during the Obama Administration and nine times in less than two years after current US President Donald Trump came into office. More countries are now joining in this so-called free navigation. Wang Hongguang, a retired lieutenant general of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) The PLA is capable of taking over Taiwan within 100 hours with only a few dozen casualties. 2018 is a year of turmoil for Taiwan, and a possible military conflict may take place in Taiwan soon. As long as the US doesn't attack China-built islands and reefs in the South China Sea, no war will take place in the area. China's moves in the South China Sea should be calm and there is no need to make waves. Luo Yuan, vice president of the China Strategic Culture Promotion Association If the US naval fleet dares to stop in Taiwan, it is time for the People's Liberation Army to deploy troops to promote national unity on the island. Achieving China's complete unity is a necessary requirement. The achievement of the past 40 years of reform and opening-up has given us the capability and confidence to safeguard our sovereignty. Those who are trying to stir up trouble in the South China Sea and Taiwan should be careful about their future. Wu Xinbo, director of Fudan University's Center for American Studies I am not optimistic about the future situation in the South China Sea and Taiwan. The US is taking measures to pressure China to stop deploying military equipment in the South China Sea, including leading media criticism on China, conducting ""free navigation"" and giving diplomatic pressure. There are some politicians in the Trump administration who support the pro-independence forces in Taiwan, and they are becoming more influential. Beyond supporting Taiwan's independence in public, the US may play more tricks on the Taiwan question, which may lead to more severe friction between China and the US. Huang Jing, a distinguished professor and dean of the Institute on National and Regional Studies at Beijing Language and Culture University The US is realizing that the value of Taiwan is decreasing and that's why it keeps using it to pressure China. The Taiwan question and South China Sea are the focus of the Sino-US balance game. The US is trying to squeeze the value out of Taiwan to create problems for China. The Chinese mainland has the initiative to settle the Taiwan question. Chen Shui-Bian has led the pro-independence movement into a dead end and Tsai Ing-wen completely blazed this path. Dai Xu, president of the Institute of Marine Safety and Cooperation The US opened three battle lines in the political, military and economic fields against China. The US keeps meddling in China's affairs, so why can't China go to areas like Hawaii where the US is ""dominant."" The initiative over the South China Sea and Taiwan should rest with China. If the cross-Straits tension rises, it is time to achieve unity. The extension of the civil war has entered diplomacy because some people have given up their initiative. Chu Hsin-min, professor at National Chengchi University In the last two years, Tsai Ing-wen's administration has a basic rule about the cross-Straits relations - she will not compromise under pressure. At the same time, she does not want the relationship to return to an adversarial one. Under such circumstances, I agree that there will be more challenges for next year's cross-Straits issues. Tsai won't compromise with the Chinese mainland under pressure, and hence may embrace the US. She may also be inclined to back independence groups due to their support. All of this will lead to intense and adversarial cross-Straits relations. I think we should have strategic patience to avoid any traps in the cross-Straits ties. "	12/9/18	0	0	0.5638	1
"Playing ‘Taiwan card’ again will backfire : expertsnPlaying the ""Taiwan card"" again as a bargaining chip by sailing US warships through the Taiwan Straits just days ahead of a likely China-US summit will backfire and further impair bilateral ties, Chinese experts said on Thursday.""The US wants to put pressure on China, but such a move won't help resolve conflicts between the two countries,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the Beijing-based China Foreign Affairs University's Institute of International Relations, told the Global Times.Following reports that the US Navy sent two ships through the Taiwan Straits on Wednesday, China's Ministry of National Defense said on Thursday that the People's Liberation Army are aware of the US warships' location in the Taiwan Straits.Ren Guoqiang, the ministry's spokesperson, warned that the PLA is constantly on alert and firmly safeguards the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.On the same day, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang urged the US to carefully handle the Taiwan question.""China does not stand back and despises such a challenge to the country's principles,"" Li said.The US should have learned a lesson that challenging China with the Taiwan question would finally harm its own interests as it touches China's bottom line, Song Zhongping, a military commentator, told the Global Times.The operation was also the first after the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party lost in local elections in Taiwan on Saturday.""US Navy's operation also shows that the mainland and the island of Taiwan are getting closer, as the US always places obstacles in the way when both sides of the Taiwan Straits have good relations,"" Li said.A majority of people in Taiwan are in favor of the 1992 Consensus, a cornerstone agreement that stabilized the cross-Straits ties, and they are disgusted with the US attempts to drive a wedge between the mainland and Taiwan, Li noted.

"US won’t desist from playing Taiwan cardnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT In Taiwan's ""nine-in-one"" elections held on Saturday, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) received a drubbing from the Kuomintang (KMT) that grabbed 15 out of a total of 22 mayoral and county magistrate seats, some of which had been long-held by the DPP. Through the vote, the people of Taiwan have sent a clear warning to the administration of Tsai Ing-wen and the DPP that they are not happy with a flailing economy and glaring political struggle. In November, the ruling parties of both the US and Taiwan fared poorly in midterm elections. In response to the defeat, Tsai quit the DPP chief's position. In his congratulatory tweet, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Taiwan local elections an example of democracy in action for the Indo-Pacific region - a brazen show of support for the island. However, who needs support most is actually his boss - President Donald Trump, after elections put Democrats in charge of the House of Representatives. The US and Taiwan have seen each other as military allies that share democracy and values and are partners in handling ties with the Chinese mainland. The Trump administration has taken a slew of measures to help Taiwan expand its international footprint. But this has done nothing except ratcheting up tensions across the Taiwan Straits. Over the last two years, they have been trying to intimidate the mainland through closer political and military cooperation, which however only cemented the mainland's determination to resolve the Taiwan question. The local elections have reminded the Tsai administration that the only wise choice is to give up a confrontational policy and return to the 1992 Consensus. Taiwanese people have proven through their votes that undermining relations with the mainland does no good to Taiwan. Where the US-Taiwan relationship is headed after elections this month depends on how they view the current situation. The Trump administration apparently hopes to maintain and even strengthen the current cooperation with Taiwan because it values the economic benefits from bilateral military cooperation and can also play the Taiwan card with the mainland. Trump has defined China as the US' strategic rival and the biggest challenge in the long run, intensifying attempts at containment. The shrewd US president won't give up any opportunity of playing the Taiwan card. Hawks within the Trump administration will likely continue pushing him to take reckless measures over Taiwan while pro-Taiwan members in the US Congress will be more eager to help their ""Taiwan friend,"" creating all kinds of trouble for the mainland. The US is becoming more damaging to cross-Straits ties. Now the key question is whether the Tsai administration will be determined to join the US to confront the mainland. The latest defeat of the DPP must have warned Tsai where Taiwan's future lies - with the mainland or the US. But if her government persists in being confrontationist rather than regarding the wellbeing of Taiwan people, it will likely spell an end to hopes of being re-elected in 2020. The US and Taiwan will have to prepare for the 2020 general election in the next two years. The Trump government, well aware of Beijing's bottom line over Taiwan, only uses the island as a tool to provoke the mainland. US-Taiwan relations depend on where Washington's ties with the mainland go. People in Taiwan need to have an explicit understanding of the US role when contemplating cross-Straits relations. The Tsai administration now has to choose whether to recognize the 1992 Consensus, and its choice will decide the future of the DPP that cannot afford another defeat. While KMT candidate Han Kuo-yu was voted to be mayor of Kaohsiung because of his campaign of restoring the city's past glory, Taiwan authorities should think carefully about how to market products made on the island and attract mainlanders so as to bring benefits to the people of Taiwan.

"Mainland, Taiwan set for closer trade ties to help both sides cope with US protectionismnWorkers assemble products at a Taiwan-based enterprise in Jiujiang, East China's Jiangxi Province in March. Photo: VCG Trade connections between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan have never stalled despite volatile cross-Straits relations in recent years, and the two sides will develop a more integrated trade relationship amid the defeat of the local election of the island's pro-independence ruling party, experts and Taiwan business representatives said.The two sides could also work together to cope with the negative effects of rising US trade protectionism, business representatives said.The remarks came after local elections, or nine-in-one elections, held in Taiwan on Saturday showed that the Democratic Progressive Party, the ruling party that has been pushing for ""desinicization"" of the island, suffered defeat.""The election results will absolutely become a positive driver for the two sides' trade cooperation. The two sides' trade dependence on each other is a 'matter of fact' that will not be altered by election,"" said Wang Yong, professor at the Xiamen Graduate Institute for Taiwan Studies of Xiamen University.From January to October, the island exported $279.7 billion worth of goods in total, with the mainland its biggest market by far. Among all exports, $115.4 billion went to the mainland, up by 10 percent year-on-year, compared with $32.47 billion to the US and $19.2 billion to Japan, according to a report from the Xinhua News Agency.Wu Jiaying, chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen's Association in Xiamen, East China's Fujian Province, told the Global Times on Monday that ""In the past few years, although the mainland has been announcing preferential policies to Taiwan people who wanted to do businesses in the mainland, the ruling party in Taiwan has curbed imports from the mainland. This has presented barriers for us who have businesses in the mainland, and some were forced to move their factories to Southeast Asia.""In February, the mainland revealed 31 new measures to boost exchanges and cooperation with Taiwan. A new regulation came into effect in September that allows residents of Taiwan to apply for residence permits in the mainland.Wu said the central government has also given subsidies to help Taiwan companies that experienced a hard time.Xue Qingde, a Taiwan businessman who has been investing for over a decade in Pingtan, Fujian Province, told the Global Times on Monday that interdependence between Taiwan and the mainland in the middle and high ends of the industrial chain cannot be easily broken and replaced by Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam.""In the fields of artificial intelligence, display panels and chip manufacturing and packaging, whether in terms of fostering talent or market demand, the two are heavily dependent on each other,"" Xue said, adding that these are also the sectors where the two will continue to cooperate in the future.""The recent economic situation in the island was not satisfactory, although the growth figure seemed positive in terms of the recovery of the global economy and its good management and economic systems,"" Wang said.Wang added that the China-US trade war will also cause some short-term pain to Taiwan businesses operating in the mainland.""But we've been exploring new markets to shake off the negative effects - for example, our exports to the Belt and Road economies have been greatly increased, and that will be our new focus,"" Wu said. ""With the mainland's preferential policies, we are expecting a more integrated economic relationship and peaceful development of the cross-Straits relations."" "	11/26/18	0	0	0.7794	1
"Local elections in Taiwan a clear signalnTsai Ing-wen announced her resignation as the chair of the Democratic Progressive Party late Saturday, to take responsibility for the party's performance in Taiwan's local elections. Photo: VCG The result of local elections in Taiwan showed that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has lost people's support and conveyed a strong signal to the US that no country shall fool Taiwan residents or attempt to play the Taiwan card to contain the mainland, Chinese analysts warned on Sunday. It is predicted that the US will continue to use Taiwan as a bargaining chip in the 2020 US general elections to restrain the development of the Chinese mainland and push Beijing to compromise. But it would be quite difficult for the US to continue with this strategy under changing regional dynamics, analysts said. Taiwan held local elections, or nine-in-one elections, to elect representatives to nine levels of government including mayors and councilors on Saturday. Among the 22 county and city chief posts, the Kuomintang (KMT) won 15 seats, the DPP landed six, and the remaining one went to an independent candidate, the Xinhua News Agency reported, citing the island's election affairs authority. Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, on Sunday said the mainland will continue to enhance solidarity with Taiwan compatriots and follow a path of peaceful development of the cross-Straits relations. Ma noted that the results reflected the strong will of the people in Taiwan in sharing the benefits of peaceful development across the Taiwan Straits, and desire to improve the island's economy and people's wellbeing. Lost support After the DPP became the ruling party of the island in 2016, cross-Straits relations have been volatile since the DPP refuses to recognize the 1992 Consensus - which embodies the one-China principle - and pushes for ""desinicization."" ""What the DPP has done in recent years has failed the residents of Taiwan and caused strong discontent. The DPP's restrictions on cross-Straits exchanges in all fields, including trade, have affected the livelihoods of the island's residents and failed to improve the economic development of the island,"" Yang Lixian, a specially-appointed research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center on Cross-Strait Relations, told the Global Times on Sunday. The DPP was defeated because residents have started abandoning the party. The people of Taiwan now realize that relying on the US will not solve their problems. Their choice sent a signal to Washington that no country shall treat them as a puppet, said Yang. In February, the Chinese mainland revealed 31 new measures to boost exchange and cooperation with Taiwan. Over 10,000 young people from the island had taken internships, found jobs or started businesses in the mainland's entrepreneurship bases and pilot sites by the end of June, according to Xinhua. In September, a new regulation came into effect that allows residents of Taiwan to apply for residence permits in the mainland. More than 22,000 Taiwan residents had applied for such residence permits in the Chinese mainland by September. Changing dynamics Observers predict the US will not come to terms with the election results and will continue playing the Taiwan card to contend with the mainland. ""The next year will be full of turbulence and changes, and the situation in Taiwan is still tough,"" Chang Ya-chung, an international relations professor at National Taiwan University, told the Global Times. Chang said the US will fully manipulate Taiwan to speak for the favor of Washington in the 2020 general elections and push the mainland into a dilemma. ""For example, the US may invite Tsai Ing-wen for an official visit,"" he said, adding that it is hard for both the KMT and the DPP to ultimately change their attitude toward the US. The US' previous engagement in defense cooperation with the island of Taiwan has typically maintained a low profile, but things are changing now. Security collaboration between the US and the island of Taiwan is increasing, and some of it has been made public. In the past two years, the Pentagon has stressed the US' commitment to arms sales to Taiwan. Washington has also granted the marketing license for the sale of submarine technology to the island. Washington sent two US destroyers through the Taiwan Straits in July, a gesture that many observers believe is aimed at provoking China. Tsai is relying more heavily on US protection. Since US President Donald Trump announced the ""Indo-Pacific"" strategy, Tsai has sought to participate and play a special role in regional military and security affairs. However, Taiwan residents have realized that peaceful development is the right path for the island. Their demand for better livelihoods will determine how much influence the US can exert by playing the Taiwan card, said Yang. "	11/25/18	0	0	0.9973	1

"China rumors fly before Taiwan votenChina rumors fly before Taiwan vote As Taiwan's nine-in-one elections will be held on Saturday, some mainstream Western media claimed that the Chinese mainland has been trying to influence the election results by roping in Taiwan's grass-roots forces and spreading fake news online. These reports also said that Taiwan is at the frontlines of the Chinese Communist Party's ""sharp power."" American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) head James Moriarty claimed that there are external forces trying to guide Taiwan's public opinion and spread false information. He also said that Taiwan is the world's biggest victim of fake news because people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits use the same language and Taiwan enjoys high-level freedom of speech. No matter Western media or Moriarty, their vague accusations lack evidence. Many of Western media's reports intentionally quoted Taiwan residents who oppose the Chinese mainland and use the partisan language as so-called evidence. Moriarty and mainstream Western media echo Taiwan authorities' accusation that ""The Chinese mainland is interfering in Taiwan's elections."" By restating these rumors, it's they who are guiding Taiwan's public opinion, trying to influence Taiwan people's voting. The American people invented the charge of ""interfering in elections."" The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan became the first to follow suit. When Washington used such accusation as a bargaining chip, its purpose was to sway voters by accusing the Chinese mainland of interference. This is the biggest trick of the DPP's elections this time. Some US officials and Western media are joining in accusing the Chinese mainland of interfering in Taiwan's elections. This has added some Western style to the DPP's tricks. Taiwan's nine-in-one local elections shouldn't involve cross-Straits relations too much. The so-called anti-China sentiment was not brought into the last nine-in-one elections. Such tactics have nothing to do with Taiwan's local elections, and the authorities are canvassing for votes by inciting people's hate against the Chinese mainland. This is a tragedy of Taiwan's democracy. The Chinese mainland has no illusions that Taiwan would be more reasonable on the cross-Straits issue during the time of their elections. More and more people from the Chinese mainland believe the Taiwan Straits situation depends on mainland's development and its control of international conditions. Fewer mainland Chinese people care about Taiwan's internal politics. The DPP is bringing the so-called anti-China sentiment into grass-roots elections to polarize Taiwan's politics on the cross-Straits question. Taiwan authorities are further changing the rules of the region's politics, trying to redefine the current cross-Straits situation. Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen and her colleagues have been attacking the Chinese mainland almost every day recently. She is mobilizing the Taiwan people to stand in opposition to the Chinese mainland, touching on the most sensitive issues in the cross-Straits dispute. This is a slap in the face considering her measured tone regarding cross-Straits policies before. Few mainland Chinese people know what Taiwan's local elections are, and almost no one cared in the past. Accusations from Taiwan are now confusing the Chinese mainland. We want to tell Taiwan: No matter who is elected, county head or municipal mayor, the contrast of power between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan won't be changed, nor will Chinese mainland's policies or resolution. So please just mind your own electoral business. "	11/22/18	0	1	-0.9611	-1
"Taiwan’s Olympic name bid doomed to failnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT Just as a handful of people on the island of Taiwan are agitating for a referendum to change the name under which Taiwan athletes can participate in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, people with conventional wisdom and knowledge of basic history cannot help but worry about the future fate of Olympians from Taiwan, who might become spectators rather than players. Within the framework of the universally accepted one-China principle, Taiwan's participation in international affairs generally follows two routes. One is the UN model, where Taiwan, as an inalienable part of China, is ineligible to apply for membership to international organizations which require members to have the status of sovereign states. The other is the International Olympic Committee (IOC) model, where Taiwan is granted membership as part of China. The history of Chinese athletes from both sides of the Taiwan Straits participating in the Olympic Games is not very long - the first Chinese athlete showed up in an Olympic Games only in 1932 in Los Angeles - but pretty complicated. The representation of China at the IOC, just as was the case with the United Nations, had been a struggle between the Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan in the 1970s. The thorny issue was finally settled in October 1979 when the IOC Executive Board convened in Nagoya, Japan. In line with decisions made at this meeting, a postal vote of the entire IOC membership was taken on a resolution that the Beijing-based national Olympic committee (NOC) be recognized as the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC) while the committee based in Taipei, Taiwan be called the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee (CTOC), with the CTOC having to adopt a different anthem, flag and emblem from those used in the past. Under an agreement signed in 1981 between the IOC and the CTOC, athletes from the island of Taiwan are able to participate in the summer and winter editions of the Olympic Games and other international sports events under the team name of ""Chinese Taipei."" It is obvious that the ""Chinese Taipei"" solution demonstrates the goodwill from both the IOC and the Beijing-based COC for the maximum benefit of athletes from Taiwan. However, the referendum, to be held on November 24, will ask if sports teams from the island should drop the ""Chinese Taipei"" title and go to the world sports arenas including Tokyo 2020 with the name of ""Team Taiwan."" This is, of course, wishful and infeasible thinking by a small number of pro-independence elements in Taiwan. And their move is deemed unreasonable, ridiculous and even dangerous. If it is not passed, the campaign turns out to be simply a farce, which will surely undermine these people's credibility. If it is passed, as chance would have it, the consequences will be a hard nut to crack for both Taiwan authorities and the campaigners themselves. Put aside the inevitable strong reactions from the Chinese mainland, which will by no means tolerate any attempt to move toward the independence of Taiwan, the referendum will force the IOC to take further punitive measures. Just days before the referendum date, the IOC, in a letter dated November 16, told the heads of CTOC and Taiwan's sports authority explicitly that any change to the name of the CTOC/delegation is subject to the approval of the IOC Executive Board, but the Board … ""has decided to re-confirm the IOC's position and not to approve any change to the name of CTOC."" As the IOC has made its stance on this issue crystal-clear in this ultimatum, any continued challenge to the IOC's authority ""might expose the CTOC to the protective measures set out in the Olympic Charter in these circumstances (Rule 27.9 in particular)."" Although the November 16 letter - the third similar missive from the IOC to Taiwan's relevant authorities following one in May and another in October - stopped short of stating what these protective measures would be, Rule 27.9 in the Olympic Charter stipulates that ""Apart from the measures and sanctions provided in the case of infringement of the Olympic Charter, the IOC Executive Board may take any appropriate decisions for the protection of the Olympic Movement in the country of an NOC, including suspension of or withdrawal of recognition from such NOC if the constitution, law or other regulations in force in the country concerned, or any act by any governmental or other body causes the activity of the NOC or the making or expression of its will to be hampered."" This means that the referendum and its final result could force the IOC to suspend or withdraw its recognition of the CTOC. If the CTOC is suspended, the IOC recognition could be resumed with due process. However, if the IOC withdraws its recognition, it is almost a mission impossible for Taiwan to re-apply for a membership of the IOC, as it is not a member of either the UN or the International Red Cross Society. The reality that some countries have separate Olympic committees at the IOC - a national one and a regional one/regional ones - is the legacy of history, but not a necessity in the future. If the CTOC loses its IOC membership, how would athletes from Taiwan participate in future international sports events? It is not too late for those name-changing campaigners to drop the case immediately, to save their own face and to keep others from unnecessary headaches and troubles. Otherwise, they will have to ""swallow its own bitter fruit,"" as a spokesperson from the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office has said, ""and they will be sacrificing Taiwan athletes' chances to compete and the benefits and well-being of the Taiwan compatriots."" Fingers crossed for the Olympians from the island of Taiwan, who deserve a trip to Tokyo, but may end up watching TV broadcast of the Olympic Games on their home couches.

"Taiwan athletes unite against name change referendumnTaiwan athletes unite against name change referendum Athletes from the island of Taiwan on Wednesday gathered in Taipei to reject a referendum to change the name of its team from ""Chinese Taipei"" to ""Taiwan,"" as it would shut Taiwan athletes out of the international arena. Athletes, including track and field athlete Cheng Chao-tsun and Olympics gold medalist Hsu Shu-ching shouted, ""I reject the name change referendum!"" during the press conference in Taipei, Taiwan-based chinatimes.com reported on Wednesday. Lin said she was disappointed with the inaction of the Tsai Ing-wen government. ""Our only protection is the Lausanne agreement. The deal is the only way to provide us with a stage and show our abilities, and to make people aware of where we come from,""Lin was quoted as saying in the report. Voters will decide in a referendum on Saturday whether the island should compete as ""Taiwan"" rather than ""Chinese Taipei"" at all international sporting events, including the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday. The referendum is one of the 10 voting events on Saturday during the local public service elections. The International Olympic Committee has already sent three letters to the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, the non-government entity which manages Taiwan's presence at international sporting events, reiterating its position on the matter, Taiwan News reported on Tuesday. A name change would result the Taiwan losing its Olympic membership status, since Taiwan is neither a UN member, nor a member of International Committee of the Red Cross, the news site chinatimes.com said.

"Taiwan’s Olympic name bid doomed to failnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT Just as a handful of people on the island of Taiwan are agitating for a referendum to change the name under which Taiwan athletes can participate in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, people with conventional wisdom and knowledge of basic history cannot help but worry about the future fate of Olympians from Taiwan, who might become spectators rather than players. Within the framework of the universally accepted one-China principle, Taiwan's participation in international affairs generally follows two routes. One is the UN model, where Taiwan, as an inalienable part of China, is ineligible to apply for membership to international organizations which require members to have the status of sovereign states. The other is the International Olympic Committee (IOC) model, where Taiwan is granted membership as part of China. The history of Chinese athletes from both sides of the Taiwan Straits participating in the Olympic Games is not very long - the first Chinese athlete showed up in an Olympic Games only in 1932 in Los Angeles - but pretty complicated. The representation of China at the IOC, just as was the case with the United Nations, had been a struggle between the Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan in the 1970s. The thorny issue was finally settled in October 1979 when the IOC Executive Board convened in Nagoya, Japan. In line with decisions made at this meeting, a postal vote of the entire IOC membership was taken on a resolution that the Beijing-based national Olympic committee (NOC) be recognized as the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC) while the committee based in Taipei, Taiwan be called the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee (CTOC), with the CTOC having to adopt a different anthem, flag and emblem from those used in the past. Under an agreement signed in 1981 between the IOC and the CTOC, athletes from the island of Taiwan are able to participate in the summer and winter editions of the Olympic Games and other international sports events under the team name of ""Chinese Taipei."" It is obvious that the ""Chinese Taipei"" solution demonstrates the goodwill from both the IOC and the Beijing-based COC for the maximum benefit of athletes from Taiwan. However, the referendum, to be held on November 24, will ask if sports teams from the island should drop the ""Chinese Taipei"" title and go to the world sports arenas including Tokyo 2020 with the name of ""Team Taiwan."" This is, of course, wishful and infeasible thinking by a small number of pro-independence elements in Taiwan. And their move is deemed unreasonable, ridiculous and even dangerous. If it is not passed, the campaign turns out to be simply a farce, which will surely undermine these people's credibility. If it is passed, as chance would have it, the consequences will be a hard nut to crack for both Taiwan authorities and the campaigners themselves. Put aside the inevitable strong reactions from the Chinese mainland, which will by no means tolerate any attempt to move toward the independence of Taiwan, the referendum will force the IOC to take further punitive measures. Just days before the referendum date, the IOC, in a letter dated November 16, told the heads of CTOC and Taiwan's sports authority explicitly that any change to the name of the CTOC/delegation is subject to the approval of the IOC Executive Board, but the Board … ""has decided to re-confirm the IOC's position and not to approve any change to the name of CTOC."" As the IOC has made its stance on this issue crystal-clear in this ultimatum, any continued challenge to the IOC's authority ""might expose the CTOC to the protective measures set out in the Olympic Charter in these circumstances (Rule 27.9 in particular)."" Although the November 16 letter - the third similar missive from the IOC to Taiwan's relevant authorities following one in May and another in October - stopped short of stating what these protective measures would be, Rule 27.9 in the Olympic Charter stipulates that ""Apart from the measures and sanctions provided in the case of infringement of the Olympic Charter, the IOC Executive Board may take any appropriate decisions for the protection of the Olympic Movement in the country of an NOC, including suspension of or withdrawal of recognition from such NOC if the constitution, law or other regulations in force in the country concerned, or any act by any governmental or other body causes the activity of the NOC or the making or expression of its will to be hampered."" This means that the referendum and its final result could force the IOC to suspend or withdraw its recognition of the CTOC. If the CTOC is suspended, the IOC recognition could be resumed with due process. However, if the IOC withdraws its recognition, it is almost a mission impossible for Taiwan to re-apply for a membership of the IOC, as it is not a member of either the UN or the International Red Cross Society.

"Taiwan's manufacturing expands at slowest pace in over 2 yearsnTaiwan's manufacturing expands at slowest pace in over 2 years Taiwan's purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector dropped from 53.9 in September to 51.8 in October, the slowest expansion pace since May 2016, a Taipei-based think tank said Monday. A PMI above 50 indicates expansion, while below reflects contraction. The service sector PMI dropped 0.9 points to 49.9 in October, the first time it has been below the boom-bust line since March 2017, according to the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER). Specifically, the sub-index for new orders in the manufacturing sector dropped a substantial 4 points to 51.2 last month, while the sub-index for the raw material inventory ended a 30-month streak of expansion, registering at 50. Meanwhile, the island's business outlook in manufacturing seemed gloomy. The CIER index, which monitors the manufacturing business outlook for the next six months, dived 7 points to 40.6 in October, the steepest drop in three years and the second consecutive month showing a below-50 figure. CIER analyst Jiann-Chyuan Wang attributed the falling PMI to a wait-and-see attitude among manufacturers, given uncertainty from external environments and a worldwide fall in raw material prices.

"China hopes Japan could tackle Taiwan-related issues properly: spokespersonnChina hopes Japan could tackle Taiwan-related issues properly: spokesperson China hopes Japan will keep its promise and properly deal with Taiwan-related issues so as to safeguard the political foundation for the healthy development of China-Japan relations, a spokesperson said Wednesday. Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks at a press conference. The Japanese side has affirmed many times that it will continue to abide by the spirit of the four political documents between China and Japan, Ma said. The four documents refer to the 1972 Sino-Japanese Joint Statement, the 1978 China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship, the 1998 China-Japan Joint Declaration, and the 2008 joint statement on advancing strategic and mutually beneficial relations. During Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's official visit to China last week, he reiterated Japan's stance toward Taiwan, which had been made clear in the 1972 Sino-Japanese Joint Statement.

"Embassy: Polish TV show on Taiwan ‘personal behavior’nEmbassy: Polish TV show on Taiwan ‘personal behavior’ The Polish Embassy in Beijing on Tuesday said an alleged Polish TV show on YouTube supporting ""Taiwan independence"" was ""personal behavior,"" stressing that Poland has always asserted the one-China principle. An online Polish TV channel broadcast an open declaration of support for ""Taiwan independence,"" the Taiwan News reported on Tuesday. Two hosts talking in Chinese and English announced that as 2018 is Poland's 100th year of independence, the Polish people support Taiwan and encourage the island to declare ""independence,"" the report said. The report said the show can be viewed on YouTube channel Idz Pod Prad, which roughly translates as ""go against the current."" But in a statement sent to the Global Times on Tuesday, the embassy said that ""Poland established diplomatic relations with China in October 1949, one of the earliest countries to establish relations. Since then, Poland has always supported the one-China principle."" The embassy said the video was the act of an individual YouTube user and refused to make further comment. The Global Times found the video account was not affiliated to any Polish TV channel. It was established by far-right media organization Idz Pod Prad. Idz Pod Prad has been described as ""preying on the vulnerable,"" the Guardian reported in January.

"US warships cannot be protectors of TaiwannIllustration: Liu Rui/GT The US Navy sailing two warships through the Taiwan Straits for the second time since July signaled that the Trump administration was poised to increase military and political pressure on China. It seems the US Navy would like to operate in the waters regularly, in keeping with their so-called freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea and B-52 bombers entering the Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in East China Sea. What happened is not surprising as US President Donald Trump and the Congress hope to improve relations with Taiwan by promulgating the Taiwan Travel Act and two provisions pertaining to Taiwan in 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, which encourage visits between officials of the US and Taiwan at all levels. This has been backed up by calls for strengthening security cooperation with Taiwan.Although the US promised to abide by the One-China policy, which is the political foundation of Sino-US relations, the Trump administration took a relook at its approach to the island. As the US has clearly labeled China as a strategic rival and changed the engagement policy with the nation, Washington will play the ""Taiwan card"" with the intention of suppressing Beijing.The timing of US warships transit may influence Taiwan local elections in 2018 and support Tsai Ing-wen's authority and her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). In the long term, the potential US warship routine transit is not only a tactical signal to the Taiwan island and the mainland, but also suggests concrete steps to implement the new grand strategy to contain China.With military modernization, China has become more capable and confident of countering US provocations. The Chinese side closely monitored from start to end the passage of the US warships through the Taiwan Straits, which could send signals to ""Taiwan independence"" forces that US support will not be allowed to go without resistance. Confronting the mainland by relying on foreign forces will damage cross-Straits relations and push more people in Taiwan to part ways with the DPP.Beijing has been prepared for more provocations by the US military, especially the navy and air force. As Washington has clearly defined China as a strategic competitor in the long term and with the Trump administration increasing military expenditure, China has to brace for confrontation.At the same time, it's necessary for both countries to improve military exchanges to reduce misunderstandings and miscalculations. More encounters between warships, fighters and reconnaissance aircraft will increase the risk of collision, and mishaps are likely to affect bilateral relations. History is a mirror and it is known that during the Cold War, the US and Soviet submarines played the cat and mouse game and collided in the Barents Sea, which pushed the rivals ""to the brink of war"". China and the US may learn some lessons from a collision in 2001 between the EP-3 and one of the J-8s near Hainan Island, which ignited nationalism in both nations.But despite the risks and dangers, PLA has the right and obligation to push back against any US military provocation that violates Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity.The other intention of the US is to try to reshape security and strategic environment in the region, which it believes has been benefiting China for the past two decades. Washington would like to egg on Tsai Ing-wen to confront the Chinese mainland and instigate pro-US forces in relevant countries in the region to create trouble in the South China Sea where the overall situation is generally stable. China and other countries in the region should be wise to this.The disaster created by US military intervention in the Middle East shows that US warships can't be protectors of the people of Taiwan and other Asian countries and regions.The author is an associate research fellow of American Studies Institute, China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	10/28/18	0	0	0.961	1

"China’s security concept in focus at key forumnEditor's Note: The 8th Beijing Xiangshan Forum kicked off on Thursday. Chinese President Xi Jinping's congratulatory message was read out at the opening ceremony, highlighting the new concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security amid the growing security challenges facing the world. This was followed by an address by Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe, who laid out the Chinese military's standpoint on a variety of key issues. What message does China want to convey? Global Times reporter Sun Xiaobo talked with three experts from within and outside China attending the forum, about their views. Yan Guilong, director of Foreign Military Studies Center, Information Engineering University (Luoyang) of the Strategic Support Force President Xi's congratulatory message has set the tone that China hopes to enhance strategic mutual trust and security cooperation with other countries. The new concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security proposed by China suggests that countries deepen their consensus on the basis of their exchanges and resolve differences in an open, consultative, equal and inclusive manner in a concerted effort to build a community with shared future for mankind. This provides a clear strategic guidance for our exploration on international governance and common prosperity. Wei's address has reiterated China's determination to pursue a path of peaceful development and clarified the position of the Chinese military over key questions like Taiwan. He severely criticized the US rhetoric that hypes up the China threat and undermines Sino-US relations, and stated the bottom line of Chinese military policy over the US attempt to meddle in the Taiwan question. Chinese military will defend our core interests by all means and will not allow any country to use Taiwan as a leverage against China. Ken Jimbo, professor with the Faculty of Policy Management, Keio University As China enhances its economic and military capability, there has been growing confidence that Beijing can provide alternatives to international security governance. As Xi and Wei have pointed out, China is now being conscious about taking international responsibility to preserve peace. That kind of consciousness is quite encouraging for regional partners and across the region. Generally, the concept is quite fine, especially from the Japanese point of view. We have agreed upon crisis management mechanism and significantly toned down the confrontational voices over maritime management issues. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is visiting China to primarily talk about economic cooperation. I think such political trust should be the baseline of regional cooperation. In this context, voices from Chinese leaders encouraging bilateral relations are quite welcoming. Hwang Jae-ho, dean of the Division of International Studies at the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies I think the Chinese defense minister doesn't want to confront the US and hopes to keep good relations, but he also declared that the Chinese military would defend Taiwan at any cost. Apart from that, the congratulatory message by Xi and the speech by Wei took a neutral tone and showed much restraint, with the intention of not drawing US ire. Wei has clarified the stance of the Chinese military. He emphasized China's pursuit of a new type of relations, which echoes the theme of this year's forum - building a new type of security partnership of equality, mutual trust and win-win cooperation. Once there is reliable military trust between two countries, other fields will see improvement. China has sent a message to the US to improve bilateral relations, and it now depends on how Washington responds. Perhaps the 2018 G20 Buenos Aires summit in late November can be an opportunity for the leaders of China and the US to meet. "	10/25/18	0	0	0.9947	1
"Mainland authorities mourn victims of Taiwan’s train derailment tragedynMainland authorities mourn victims of Taiwan’s train derailment tragedy The Chinese mainland mourned victims of Taiwan's train derailment on Sunday, as the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits expressed their heartfelt condolences to the families of the injured and dead. As of Monday morning, the toll from the Sunday derailment stood at 18 dead and 190 injured, including a US national, local media reported. Taiwan health department announced that two people from the mainland were among those injured. The Puyuma Express No. 6432 bound for Taitung from Shulin Station with 366 passengers on board derailed at 4:50 pm at Xinma Station, Yilan county. According to media reports, all eight carriages of the train were derailed, and five of them toppled over. Affected passengers were sent to hospitals nearby in police cars and ambulances. Taiwan's transportation authorities said that the derailed train operated for six years was overhauled not long ago. A driver said an unidentified object was suspected to have caused the derailment, local media reported. The cause of the deadly derailment is still under investigation. The Puyuma train was imported from Japan, and started operation in February 2013 with a maximum speed of 150 kilometers per hour. Another Puyuma train derailed last year with no casualties. It is unknown whether passengers were trapped under the carriage until the carriage is lifted by a crane, said the transportation authority. The mainland has paid close attention to the accident, said officials from the mainland authorities. "	10/22/18	0	0	-0.994	-1

(Xinhua/Liu Rui) The Chinese mainland resolutely opposes official contacts and military links in any form between the US and the island of Taiwan, said the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council in Beijing on Wednesday in response to media reports saying a US Navy vessel docked at a Taiwan port to refuel and make crew changes.The standpoint of the Chinese mainland is consistent and clear, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson of the office, said at a routine press conference on Wednesday.Chinese experts said on Wednesday that the US is testing the Chinese mainland's bottom line and the vessel poses a serious threat to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) despite Taiwan authorities stressing that it is for scientific research, not military use.The remarks of Ma and experts came after Taiwan newspapers reported Tuesday that the Thomas G. Thompson, a scientific research vessel under the US Office of Naval Research, docked at a port in Kaohsiung, Taiwan on a scientific research mission.The US Office of Naval Research is a scientific research unit under the US Navy, said these reports.Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times Wednesday that the so-called academic purpose and scientific research are only covers for military activities.A vessel like Thomas G. Thompson has potential to gather hydrological information of sea areas around the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, Song said.Upon gaining this information, US submarines can be stealthier and more capable of an ambush near Chinese waters, posing a serious threat to the PLA Navy, he said.Taiwan's ""defense minister"" Yen De-fa said that it was already the fourth time the research vessel has visited Taiwan this year, Taipei-based China Times reported on Tuesday.The mainland must not stop preparing for a potential military struggle with Taiwan, Song said, noting that the vessel's visit is a move to test the Chinese mainland's bottom line.Jin Yi, an expert at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the move violated the one-China principle in having military contact between the US and Taiwan, and may promote Taiwan separatists toward more dangerous moves.""The ties between China and the US are already in a difficult time with the trade dispute, and the US is adding fuel to the fire if it challenges China's core interest,"" Jin said.Song said that ""if the mainland does not respond to this, more supportive vessels will come and dock in Taiwan.""""Combat vessels like Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and Ticonderoga-class cruisers, or even amphibious transport docks and a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier might come in the future,"" Song noted.

"Taiwan leader’s speech nonsense: mainland officialnTaiwan leader’s speech nonsense: mainland official Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen's speech was full of ""separatist nonsense and antagonist thinking"" against the Chinese mainland, Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council said Wednesday, in response to Tsai's provocative speech on Double Tenth commemoration. ""Coupled with the evil intentions of some Western countries to contain the Chinese mainland,"" the speech proved Tsai's party is the destroyer of peace between the island of Taiwan and the Chinese mainland, Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office said on Wednesday. In Tsai's speech, which marked Taiwan's 107th commemoration of Double Tenth Day, she said that Taiwan will adopt all measures to deal with infiltration, the Taiwan-based United Daily News reported online on Wednesday. She even called the Chinese mainland the ""source of conflicts."" Any move that threatens cross-Straits relations is an insult to itself and cannot succeed, Ma added. Tsai's remarks came days after US Vice President Mike Pence's speech accusing Beijing of orchestrating an aggressive military, economic and political campaign to expand its influence inside the US and across other regions in the world. In her speech, Tsai deliberately catered to the ""China threat"" theory in a bid to seek support from Western countries. Jin Yi, an expert at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Social Sciences(CASS), told the Global Times on Wednesday. Tsai's fawning partially resulted from international pressure, especially the loss of several diplomatic allies this year, Zhang Hua, assistant research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of CASS, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Tsai tried to exploit the problems between Chinese mainland and the US to seek ""Taiwan independence,"" Zhang said. That was a misjudgment, he said. ""The US will never run the risk of confronting the Chinese mainland to back Taiwan, and Taiwan is just a card of the US which could easily be abandoned,"" Zhang said. Tsai insisted she would not confront the issue or jeopardize cross-Straits relations, nor would she sacrifice Taiwan's ""sovereignty."" Zhang said that as Taiwan has dragged the US into cross-Straits relations, the mainland will respond by pressuring Taiwan with more frequent military actions around the island.

"Taiwan’s silly folly in aiding trade warnAs the China-US trade war flares up, the island of Taiwan has decided to buy more soybeans from the US. It is reported that Taiwan will buy between 3.2-3.9 million tons of soybeans valued at up to $1.56 billion from Iowa and Minnesota in 2018 and 2019. The moves by Taiwan are both pitiful and ridiculous. It is clear that Taiwan authorities have thrown themselves at the US and have become the only party to pick a side between Beijing and Washington amid their intense trade frictions. Taiwan authorities did not do so out of nobleness, but because it has no bargaining chip in its relations with the US. It can only ""pay tribute"" to the US to win Washington's favor and secure US' promises to protect Taiwan's security. This is the extra cost that Taiwan needs to pay for the worsening cross-Straits relations due to its leader Tsai Ing-wen. If cross-Straits ties were to retain a more normalized state during the Ma Ying-jeou era, Taiwan could seek some kind of ""equality"" in its relations with the US or even strike a balance between the US and the Chinese mainland. But now, the Democratic Progressive Party can only kneel down to Washington. In 2017, the Chinese mainland bought 30 million tons of soybeans from the US. If US farmers lose this business because of the trade war, what's the use of Taiwan buying a few million tons? Taiwan authorities are eager to show their ""loyalty"" to the US, but US farmers will find it both laughable and annoying. The population of Taiwan equals that of Beijing, and Taiwan cannot consume that many US soybeans. That Taiwan buys US soybeans is like buying arms and sending US money. But even arms won't guarantee Taiwan security, let alone soybeans. Taiwan's security can only be secured through political means not military means. If Taiwan makes itself a pawn of external forces to oppose the Chinese mainland, it will lose leverage to gain security for itself and set itself adrift amid China-US competition. Taiwan should also be clear that its trade surplus mainly comes from the mainland and amounts to tens of billions of dollars annually. The mainland will not interfere with Taiwan developing normal trade ties with other countries, but Taiwan should not exploit these ties to target the mainland. If Taiwan helps external forces hit the mainland's economy, it will become a target of control by the mainland. Taiwan is too small to afford to play this game of politics and geopolitics. Taiwan should try to seek balance among major powers rather than catering to the US while confronting the mainland. This should remain the fundamental political philosophy of Taiwan before the reunification of the mainland and Taiwan. It is time for Taiwan to have true self-reflection. "	9/29/18	0	0	0.9896	1
"Arms sale to Taiwan to result in soured tiesn Illustration: Liu Rui/GT The Pentagon said on Monday that the US State Department has approved the possible sale of spare parts for F-16 fighters and other military planes worth up to $330 million to Taiwan, which follows $1.42 billion sales to the island approved by President Donald Trump in June last year. The moves violate the one-China principle and the three Joint Communiqués issued by China and the US, a collection of joint statements made by the two countries in 1972, 1978 and 1982.For a long time, the US has been using arms sales to Taiwan as an approach to meddling in the Taiwan question, unilaterally believing that such sales can boost Taiwan's defensive capability and balance the military strength between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.Since 1979 every US government has sold arms to Taiwan, damaging China-US ties. The reasons behind the arms sales are complicated. They include the lobbying efforts from Taiwan side, the interests of US military enterprises as well as the changed situation of Beijing-Washington relations.Not long after he took office, Trump was quite reckless when it came to the Taiwan question. He said that the one-China policy could be a tradable good in all China-US deals. This approach could fundamentally shatter bilateral ties. Amid the Chinese government's strong protest and active negotiations, Washington agreed to honor the one-China policy after previously placing it in doubt. But Washington continues to make trouble on the Taiwan question. In March this year, Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act into law, which will break the restrictions on US officials' visits to Taiwan and increase US interference in the Taiwan question.The proposed $330 million sale is not a big sum compared with previous deals, but it comes with unusual symbolic significance. Amid a deteriora­tion in Sino-US relations and cross-Straits relations, the arms sale to Taiwan will definitely aggravate tensions. If the contradictions between China and the US concerning military affairs and the Taiwan question continue to deepen, it will to some extent damage bilateral ties. Meanwhile, trade friction between the two countries will become increasingly hard to resolve.Adopting a risky attitude toward the Taiwan question, the Trump administration is still well aware of the red line. Washington is consciously exercising restraint in its arms sales to Taiwan without selling the advanced weapons which the island demanded. Yet persistent lobbying efforts by Taiwan, constant requests from US military enterprises and unceasing hype by the US Congress are also prompting the Trump administration to sell arms to Taiwan.The harm of the Trump administration's Taiwan policy lies in a miscalculation of playing the Taiwan card that will likely cause great damage to Sino-US relations. As a businessman-turned president, Trump is a veteran negotiator, who tends to combine different issues together on the negotiating table. If he wants to pressure China on trade friction through the Taiwan card, that approach won't work. Taiwan is a core interest of China. The Chinese government will spare no effort in safeguarding it. The US should be aware that if Washington overplays the Taiwan card, the Sino-US relationship may suffer heavily.As far as cross-Straits relations are concerned, the real imbalance is posed by economics rather than security. Instead of helping Taiwan develop its economy, the US chooses to charge a protection fee to Taiwan. The US is obviously playing the Taiwan card for its own sake. It is in the common interest of both China and the US to maintain Taiwan's stability. China strongly opposes US arms sales to Taiwan. The Chinese government will also take practical measures corresponding to relevant US moves.Since the end of the Cold War, no US government has benefited much from playing the Taiwan card. The Trump administration should learn lessons and try to avoid risking big losses for the sake of small gains.The author is secretary-general of the International Security Study Center at China Foreign Affairs University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	9/28/18	0	0	-0.967	-1
"US arms sale to Taiwan violates one-China principle, creating a ‘time bomb’ in bilateral relationsnChina strongly opposes all sales of military hardware to Taiwan, including the latest that was reportedly approved by the US State Department, a move that seriously violates the foundational one-China principle and damages China's sovereignty and security interests, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of National Defense on Tuesday. The US sale of military equipment will do nothing to challenge the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) overwhelming military superiority toward Taiwan, and amounts to yet another provocation that seriously impacts the one-China principle which is a long-standing prerequisite for China-US relations, said Chinese experts, adding that the sale is a potential ""time bomb"" confronting bilateral ties. ""The move by the US to sell weapons to Taiwan has seriously violated international law and basic norms of international relations, as well as the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiqués,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said at Tuesday's routine press conference in Beijing. The US State Department has approved the possible sale to the island of spare parts for F-16 fighter jets and other military aircraft worth up to $330 million, the Pentagon said on Monday, Reuters reported on Tuesday. The approval covers a request for spare parts for ""F-16, C-130, F-5, Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF), all other aircraft systems and subsystems, and other related elements of logistics and program support,"" the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement. China expressed its strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to the US' approval of the sale, said Geng. ""China urges the US to stop the military sale to Taiwan immediately, and cut off military ties with Taiwan,"" said Geng. The three China-US Joint Communiqués are a collection of joint statements made by the two countries in 1972, 1978 and 1982, which includes the explicit acknowledgement by the US that ""Taiwan is a part of China"" and the promise to ""gradually reduce its arms sales to Taiwan."" The most serious issue with the sale is more political than military, said Diao Daming, an American studies expert and associate professor at Renmin University of China. ""The US has continuously challenged China's bottom line on the Taiwan question, including passing the 'Taiwan Travel Act' and '2019 National Defense authorization Act.'"" These show that the US attitude toward the Taiwan question is becoming increasingly aggressive,"" said Diao The US sale will only guarantee the normal use of Taiwan's military aircraft, and will not cause any meaningful impact to the Chinese mainland's overwhelming military advantage over the island, said Song Zhongping, a military experts and TV commentator. Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Ren Guoqiang also said on Tuesday the sale seriously damages ties between Chinese and US military forces, and the peace and stability of the Taiwan Straits. ""Chinese military's determination to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity is firm and unwavering,"" he said. A time bomb The Pentagon's statement said that the ""proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the US by helping to improve the security and defensive capability of the recipient, which has been and continues to be an important force for political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region."" The military advantage that the Chinese mainland holds over Taiwan is unchangeable, making the sale nothing more than another provocation that will simply test the patience of the Chinese mainland for peaceful reunification, rather than damaging its ability to realize reunification by other means, Song said. ""If the US continues its provocations or even directly supports 'Taiwan independence,' it could create potential for military conflict between the two countries. It's like a time bomb in the middle of China-US ties, and the fuse is in the hands of the US,"" Song said. US President Donald Trump's policy toward China is ""playing with fire,"" Diao noted. ""The administration is making an irresponsible move that will impact China-US relations, world peace, and the US itself."" "	9/25/18	0	0	0.9805	1
"Arms sale to Taiwan a costly US errornArms sale to Taiwan a costly US error The Pentagon said Monday that the US State Department has approved sales of spare parts for F-16 fighters and other military planes to Taiwan. The proposed sale will be subject to Congressional approval, with little possibility of a veto. The proposed $330 million sale is not a big sum compared with $1.42 billion sales to Taiwan last year by President Donald Trump and previous sales by his predecessors. However, China strongly opposes any arms sales to Taiwan. The proposed sale came on the same day that the US' 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese exports took effect. The US used to avoid making two such moves on the same day, but it doesn't care now. Beijing has mastered a whole set of tactics against such arms sales, which will be adopted in accordance with the sales level. The latest proposed sale is not the most serious, but the past year has witnessed a tendency for the US to sell arms to Taiwan in smaller amounts and higher frequencies. Such sales used to occur once every few years. If the US intends to pressure China with the proposed sale amid ongoing trade friction, it won't work. It's China's strategic determination to never make concessions in an unprincipled manner. The latest arms sales are not heavy enough to shake this determination the way Washington hopes. Taiwan is an important front in efforts to bar the US from expanding the trade war into other fields. The mainland has been adequately prepared in this respect for any risks with a multitude of countermeasures. Beijing has sufficient strategic will and deterrence in the region. If the conflict escalates, the US will have lower chances of winning than in other areas. The Chinese side sees both stepped-up arms sales to Taiwan and more military engagement with the island province as provocation. In response, Beijing will not only adopt head-on countermeasures, but take revengeful actions that make the US pay a price. The Chinese mainland adheres to the policy of addressing the Taiwan question by peaceful means. If Taiwan authorities collude with Washington and touch upon the red line set by the Anti-Secession Law, the mainland will change its method. This deserves the attention of both the island of Taiwan and the US. It's easier for the mainland to punish pro-independence activists in Taiwan than for the US to support them. As long as the Chinese mainland keeps growing stronger, Washington will find it harder to play the Taiwan card and Taiwan will be unable to bear a real crisis in the Taiwan Straits. Beijing should respond to the proposed sale in just the way it used to, without reading too much into it. Amid frictions between China and the US, we Chinese need to see clearly the big picture and take precise and powerful measures. "	9/25/18	0	0	0.9638	1
"Taiwan political force in power undermining cross-Strait ""status quo"": Chinese FMnTaiwan political force in power undermining cross-Strait ""status quo"": Chinese FM It is the Taiwan political force which has not given up the proposition of ""Taiwan independence"" that is ""undermining the status quo of cross-Strait relations,"" said visiting Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi here on Friday. Wang made the remarks during a joint press conference with Dominican Foreign Minister Miguel Vargas when he commented on questions from reporters. One put forward that recently some countries and some public opinion claimed that the establishment of diplomatic relations between countries like Dominican Republic and China is ""unilaterally changing the status quo across the Taiwan Strait"" and is not conducive to the stability and development of the region. Wang said there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, which is both a basic fact and an important consensus of the international community. The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and countries like the Dominican Republic has followed both historical and international trend, and standing together with most countries in the world is undoubtedly a correct choice and also in full compliance with the fundamental and long-term interests of the country and people of the Dominican Republic, said Wang. As for the so-called ""changing the status quo across the Taiwan Strait,"" Wang said, what he wants to make clear is that the administration now in Taiwan is a political force that has not given up the proposition of ""Taiwan independence."" It is precisely what the Democratic Progressive Party administration has been doing that is undermining the ""status quo"" that both sides of the strait belong to the same country and cross-Strait relations are not country-to-country relations, he said. What they have been doing not only hinders the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, but also erodes regional peace and stability, Wang added. The Dominican Republic cut ties with the Taiwan authorities and drew a clear line with them, which is maintaining the international consensus of one-China principle and plays a positive role in the peace across Taiwan Strait, said Wang. Wang said that sovereign independent countries such as the Dominican Republic, can completely decide their own foreign policy, which, according to the United Nations Charter, other countries have no right to and should not interfere with. The Dominican Republic's establishment of diplomatic relations with China does not target any third party, does not affect respective foreign policy, and will not harm the traditional influence and legitimate rights of other countries in the region. Wang is on his first stop during his official visits to the Dominican Republic, Guyana and Suriname from Thursday to Sunday. "	9/23/18	0	0	0.9782	1
"National security organ warns of Taiwan spies’ attempts to recruit mainland studentsnChinese mainland students must stay on high alert over Taiwan spies, the mainland's national security authorities warned after they recently revealed cases in which mainland students were incited to provide confidential information to Taiwan's ""intelligence agencies.""Mainland national security authorities told the Global Times that Taiwan ""intelligence agencies"" are offering money, faking close relations and offering sexual temptations to people including mainland students who study in Taiwan, as a means to incite defection.""Taiwan authorities must avoid any further damage to the increasingly complicated and intense cross-Straits relations,"" An Fengshan, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said in a statement released on Sunday.The mainland's national security organs have launched a special campaign to crack down on these activities by Taiwan, he noted.The fact that the Taiwan ""intelligence agencies"" are building a spy network among mainland students seriously damages national security and national interest, and harms the overall peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, mainland authorities said.When Song Zhe (pseudonym), a mainland university student, was on an exchange program to Taiwan in March 2011, he was invited to a meal where he was approached by a woman from Taiwan, calling herself Hsu Chia-ying.Hsu expressed an abnormal fondness for Song after he mentioned some advanced research projects of his faculty. Soon after, Hsu started inviting Song to bars and tempted Song to sex during a trip together.After Song returned to the mainland, he took part in a key national research project. Hsu continued to express her love for Song and asked him to provide theses and reports on the project. It was at this point that Song doubted Hsu's identity.However, when Song refused to provide further information to Hsu, she began to threaten Song. Unable to handle the pressure, Song provided her with research data related to national defense.According to data released by mainland national security authorities, Hsu's real name was Hsu Li-ting, a spy who worked for Taiwan's ""Military Intelligence Bureau"". Taiwan spy Hsu Li-ting Photo: Courtesy of mainland's national security authorities Sexual temptation is not the only way Taiwan spies try to get intelligence. Mainland student Zhu Hui (pseudonym) was about to write his thesis at a Taiwan university, but was having difficulty finding political figures in Taiwan to interview. At that point, Hsu Tzu-ching, who claimed to be a ""legislator assistant"" in Taiwan, approached Zhu and helped him contact multiple interviewees that he ""never thought he could contact."" Helped by Hsu Tzu-ching multiple times thereafter, Zhu invited his friend Ding Tao (pseudonym), who worked for a mainland government agency, to Taiwan for a visit on the request of Hsu Tzu-ching. Hsu Tzu-ching told Ding that she was planning to open a company in the mainland. She asked Ding to give her confidential documents in order to get an upper hand in her business, and promised Ding shares in her company. Ding gave Hsu Tzu-ching five confidential files, for which he was sentenced to jail. Mainland national security authorities said that Hsu Tzu-ching, whose real name is Hsu Yun-yuen, was also a Taiwan ""Military Intelligence Bureau"" spy who was active in multiple universities in Taiwan, looking for her prey using different identities. Taiwan spy Hsu Yun-yuen Photo: Courtesy of mainland's national security authorities Getting help in a strange land is fortunate, but sometimes there are traps.

Chen was very generous, picking up Liu and her friends at midnight at a local station in Tainan and treated them to Taiwan delicacies. ""It seemed like he did not care about money. He did everything for us,"" Liu said. Liu realized something was wrong and cut ties with Chen after the latter asked Liu to help him take photos at a mainland aviation show.

Taiwan spy Chen Tai-yu Photo: Courtesy of mainland's national security authorities Main targets A mainland national security official, who requested anonymity, told the Global Times that mainland students who study political science, economics or national defense-related majors are more likely to be targeted by Taiwan spies. The spies expect the targeted mainland students to take important positions in the future, so that they can gain access to confidential files of the mainland. The spies' requests might not involve confidentiality at first. But as they make more sensitive requests, they will threaten the students and force them to continue providing information, which are now confidential. The number of similar cases is increasing following Tsai Ing-wen's assumption to office, the official said, noting that Taiwan spies are also targeting mainland students through the internet using chat applications, campus forums and recruitment websites. Mainland national security authorities will be lenient with those students who plead guilty and repent, a staff member at the mainland national security authority told the Global Times. Students should never ignore any threat to national security, stay vigilant and refuse any ""free lunch,"" he said. "	9/16/18	0	0	0.998	1
"Be wary of Taiwan’s infiltration via mainland studentsnBe wary of Taiwan’s infiltration via mainland students China's national security authorities recently revealed a string of cases in which Taiwan spies lured Chinese mainland students to provide confidential information to Taiwan intelligence agencies, which highlights the security challenges the mainland is facing from the infiltration and espionage. Young students from the mainland have become the target of Taiwan's intelligence agencies and the cases send a warning signal to the relevant authorities. Espionage and counter-espionage activities don't just appear in films but also in real life, and may involve ordinary people. The activities in reality are not as thrilling and exotic as they are in films and drama, but they are more covert and difficult to detect as they quietly penetrate our daily life, study and work. As inconspicuous as they are, the spying activities, persistent and tempting, are far more damaging to the lives of the people and the security of the nation. After the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party took office, the Taiwan authorities dispatched more spies to the mainland, posing serious challenges and adding difficulties to counter-espionage work. The disclosed cases reveal some trends in Taiwan's espionage activities. The spies from the island serve the needs of the Taiwan authorities. At their disposal are not only traditional espionage methods such as offering money, forging close relationships and making sexual overtures, but also new technologies. They take full advantage of the convenience of e-mail, WeChat and social media. The intelligence agencies of Taiwan are shifting their main target to young students from the mainland. They have exploited opportunities from expanding international and cross-Straits exchanges brought about by the mainland's opening-up to create a network and try to rope in young students who might enter the fields of economics, science, technology and national defense. Those targeted students were supposed to have a promising future. Studying in Taiwan should have been an opportunity to improve themselves. Trapping these young people and ruining their lives, the Taiwan intelligence authorities also committed a moral crime. With the US repeatedly challenging the red line of the mainland over the Taiwan question, the cross-Straits situation is worsening. The stability of the Taiwan Strait will likely be further jeopardized. Under mounting pressure, the mainland must prepare for the worst. The jittery Taiwan authorities will have to increase their espionage activities against the mainland so as to monitor the moves of relevant departments on the mainland. Preventing the infiltration of Taiwan espionage is an important element of fighting against Taiwan independence, safeguarding the sovereignty of the nation and realizing reunification. Counter-espionage work against Taiwan needs close cooperation and coordination among relevant departments. The cases revealed by the national security authorities this time have sent a clear signal that universities and related youth organizations and institutions need to have a full understanding of the current counter-espionage situation and attach great importance to raising awareness about the counter-espionage law.

"22,000 Taiwanese apply for mainland residence permits in 10 days: spokespersonn22,000 Taiwanese apply for mainland residence permits in 10 days: spokesperson More than 22,000 Taiwan residents have applied for residence permits in the Chinese mainland by Sept. 10, An Fengshan, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said Wednesday. A new regulation came into effect on Sept. 1 that allows residents of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan to apply for residence permits in the Chinese mainland. According to the regulation, holders of the residence permit will be able to use it to register vehicles, apply for driver's licenses, take professional qualification exams, purchase tickets online and check-in at hotels. The regulation can provide more convenience to people from Taiwan in terms of their study, work and daily life in the mainland, An said, noting that the number of people applying for the permit shows that this regulation brings benefits and is well received by Taiwan compatriots including business people, young entrepreneurs, teachers and students. This regulation is among the efforts to ensure that people from Taiwan can share the mainland's development opportunities and enjoy the same treatment as mainland residents when they live in the mainland, An said. Applying for the permit is voluntary, not a requirement, An said. An also criticized the Democratic Progressive Party administration for deliberately defaming and obstructing the new policy. In terms of economic exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, An said over 10,000 young Taiwanese have taken internships, found jobs or started businesses in the mainland's entrepreneurship bases and pilot sites by the end of June. So far, the mainland has set up 76 such entrepreneurship bases and pilot sites where young people from Taiwan can enjoy preferential policies to find jobs or start businesses.

"Apple angers Chinese customers for listing Hong Kong, Taiwan on par with ChinanPhoto: Screenshot from Apple's new product release on Wednesday. Chinese netizens have called on Apple to abide by the one-China principle, after the company listed China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan separately on its latest new product release on Wednesday. On the slide showing countries and regions where the new iPhone XS will appear on market next Friday, Hong Kong and Taiwan were listed on par with China, and Taiwan was separated from China and Hong Kong by three other countries. Hong Kong and Taiwan are inalienable parts of China,which the United Nations recognizes. Since the conference listed the US Virgin Islands on par with the US, Chinese netizens wonder why Apple could not place China in front of Hong Kong and Taiwan. Apple users say this is not the first time that Apple violates the one-China principle. The built-in world clock of iPhones places China behind all mainland cities and Hong Kong. But Macao and Taipei are not listed this way. ""Multinationals like Apple usually lack the political consciousness in doing business, which may harm their own interests,"" said Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University's Institute of International Relations. ""Foreign companies operating in China should respect China's basic line and Chinese customers,"" Li said. ""Double standard in marking Chinese territory will harm the brand image of these enterprises."" Apple is not the first multinational company to adopt such a double standard. Ikea, referring to Taiwan the same way as China and other countries, caused similar disputes in August. Earlier this year several aviation companies including American Airlines received letters urging the airlines to change their incorrect reference to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao.

"Nauru tirade on China to turn itself into a laughing stocknNauruan President Baron Waqa was tough toward China at the end of the Pacific Islands Forum earlier this week. He accused China of ""bullying"" other nations and even threatened to take it to the United Nations. Such a deliberate provocation against China has made headlines in Western media. This is perhaps the biggest limelight the president of a nation of just 11,000 people has ever received since his inauguration. Nauru established diplomatic relationship with Beijing in 2002 after cutting its ties with the island of Taiwan. But it resumed its ""diplomatic ties"" with the island in 2005, bowing to Taiwan's ""dollar diplomacy."" The Guardian reported that Taiwan was paying Nauruan government ministers a secret $5,000 monthly stipend in exchange for continued relations. Waqa is an actor with a scheming and deep mind. He provoked China at a time when Australia, the US and other Western countries are concerned about China's projection of power in the South Pacific region. He is counting on not only Taiwan, but also Australia and the US to pay for his ""performance."" The Chinese people may consider it entertainment. China has no intention to bully a South Pacific nation as far away as Nauru. China's footprint has extended to every corner of the world, with Beijing having no interest in politically buying off Nauru. Nauruan authorities should not be too sentimental. But Waqa's farce makes us realize that some small countries may find fault with China to exploit devious gains. The Chinese people should not take them seriously, otherwise they will be flattered. The performance staged by Waqa will soon be forgotten by the international community. After that, Nauruan authorities will face lasting loneliness. The US and Australia said they will invest more in Pacific island nations to deal with China's rising influence. Their mentality reflects the problems that Chinese foreign investment faces. No matter where China invests, it will be scrutinized by the West as the West is always alert to China's ""expansion of influence."" The US-led West will find itself exhausted in doing so. China's increasing overseas investment is out of its natural need and is driven by the country's domestic demand. The forcible expansion of investment by the US and Australia in the South Pacific is driven by political factors rather than economic ones. Such investment can easily turn awkward. After the farce, Taiwan authorities perhaps have to foot another bill. It is expected that Taiwan will pay heed to Nauru, a country that strives to hold ties with it and caters to it. But Nauru has turned itself into a laughing stock. "	9/7/18	0	0	-0.9566	-1
"Residents of SARs, Taiwan hail mainland residence cardnResidents of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan living in the Chinese mainland welcomed their newly issued residence cards, which will allow them to enjoy the same convenience as mainland citizens. More than 6,000 public security departments on the Chinese mainland on Saturday began to accept mainland residence card applications from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan residents. Residents of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan can apply for the residence card as long as they have lived in the mainland for at least six months, have a stable job or are studying on the mainland. Cheng Po-yu, 31, from Taipei, Taiwan told the Global Times on Monday that he went to the Xingucheng police station in Beijing's Shijingshan district on Saturday morning to apply. It took Cheng 10 minutes to complete the application. His new residence card will be available within 20 working days. Cheng is the manager of Shougang Fund Beijing Vstartup Co Ltd, an institute which helps Taiwan students apply to mainland universities, obtain internship opportunities at mainland companies or start their own business in the mainland. ""With the new residence card, I will first apply for a credit card,"" and ""the 18-digit residence card, which is similar to the identity card used by Chinese mainland citizens, would bring tremendous convenience to our daily lives,"" Cheng noted. Cheng was not the only applicant who rushed to the police station. ""I was the first applicant at the police station near my home,"" Bob Xu, a Hong Kong resident who has been working at a Beijing-based media company since 2013, told the Global Times on Monday. It took him 15 minutes to submit his application on Saturday. ""Since we do not have a Chinese mainland identity card, it was very inconvenient for us,"" he said. ""For instance, we could not print booked train tickets from ticket machines at railway stations in the mainland, nor live in hotels without qualification to host residents from outside the Chinese mainland,"" Xu said. He noted that applying for a mainland residence card is free. The Public Security Department of South China's Guangdong Province said it received 2,030 applications on Saturday. Other provinces and cities didn't release the data yet. Sharing opportunities Zhang Li-qi, a Peking University student from Taiwan, said that the new residence card, with Radio Frequency Identification technology, would save him time as it could connect to online systems. ""It would be like a key to better opportunities in the mainland."" However, Chiu Chui-cheng, spokesperson at ""the Mainland Affairs Council of Taiwan,"" said on Friday that the authorities on the island of Taiwan were considering limiting Taiwan people who hold the mainland residence card from being appointed to key positions in ""government or public institutes"" in the island, Taiwan-based media reported. The mainland denied that issuing resident cards is ""a political move."" Long Mingbiao, deputy chief of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said on August 16 that the residence card would ""meet the needs of Taiwan residents to study, work and live in the mainland."" Zhang told the Global Times on Monday that the limitation set by Taiwan authorities is a ""human rights violation."" He plans to apply for a ""civil servant"" job in Taiwan in the future. ""More and more Taiwan residents have been seeking to work and live in the mainland for a long time,"" Lü Cuncheng, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said. ""Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party is worried about the Chinese mainland and Taiwan getting closer, so it's trying to misread and stigmatize policies,"" Lü told the Global Times on Monday. ""But the policies are providing greater convenience, and it can share the benefits to people from either side of the Taiwan Straits."" "	9/4/18	0	0	0.9742	1
"Foreign airlines can’t duck one-China policy: FMnForeign companies cannot steer clear of the one-China policy, the basic rule they should follow when operating in China, a spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Thursday, after US-based United Airlines listed the island of Taiwan as on a par with China on its website.The airline replaced China, Taiwan and Hong Kong with ""Chinese Yuan,"" ""New Taiwan Dollar"" and ""Hong Kong Dollar"" on the destination list, along with other destinations such as ""Australia,"" ""India"" and ""Japan"" on its website page for payment options.The move has been interpreted as a way of steering off China's request for foreign airlines to modify references to Taiwan.The one-China policy is the basic rule that a foreign company should follow when operating in China and there is no ""elasticity"" about abiding by the principle, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a daily briefing on Thursday.""There is only one China and Taiwan is a part of it. This is a basic fact, common sense and international consensus,"" Hua said.On April 25, the Civil Aviation Administration of China asked 44 international airlines to modify references to Taiwan on their websites and identify it as a part of China, granting carriers a 30-day deadline to comply.US airlines Delta, American, United and Hawaiian were the last to make the changes, hours before the deadline.

"Ikea angers Chinese over its label info about TaiwannChinese netizens have called on Ikea to abide by the one-China principle, after discovering that the company's packaging lists the Taiwan island on par with China. A Sina Weibo user claimed on August 11 he bought a vase at an Ikea store and found that its packaging refers to Taiwan the same way as China and other countries. ""[The company] earns Chinese people's money but tries to separate China?"" the user asked. Another user said on August 20 that he bought kitchen items but discovered that the products' illustration depicts Taiwan as a country, together with China, Japan, India and the Philippines. Other Sina Weibo users made similar comments, with someone saying that the company even lists Hong Kong and Taiwan as countries on its website. The Global Times found that although Ikea does not refer to Taiwan and Hong Kong as ""countries"" on its website, it places them under ""locations"" with the countries. Although Ikea separated Spain's stores and those in the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, it uses ""Spain-Mainland"" and ""Spain-Balearics and Canary Islands"" to distinguish them from each other. Both the islands are autonomous communities of Spain. "	8/27/18	0	0	-0.2846	-1
"Taiwan village chief carries ashes of former Kuomintang soldiers to their mainland hometowns, one urn at a timenLiu De-wen, the chief of a Taiwanese village, helps fulfill the last dream of the local elderly people: to bring their ashes across the Taiwan Straits to a peaceful resting place in their hometowns.Liu was born in 1967 in a remote small village in Taiwan. His parents and grandparents were all farmers. But Liu's destiny changed after he bought his own house in the Hsianghe neighborhood in Zuoying district, Kaohsiung.He then worked in Kaohsiung at a bank. In 2002, he became the chief of Hsianghe. As chief, he made an early connection with the former mainland soldiers whose ashes he now carries.Unlike other neighborhoods, Hsianghe is home to many elderly former soldiers from the Kuomintang army.These soldiers retreated to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-Shek many decades ago.The work of a neighborhood chief commonly involves dealing with petty civil disputes and helping the residents apply for government subsidies. When Liu first started his work as village chief, he found many of these elderly soldiers yearned zealously for something different. They wanted to be buried in their mainland hometowns.The Hsianghe neighborhood at its peak had more than 4,000 residents and more than 3,000 of them were single. When Liu first became chief of Hsianghe, there were about 1,000 soldiers living in solitude. Now there are fewer than 60 left.Liu once told media that he was moved by the tearful stories told by these soldiers. So starting in 2003, he voluntarily helped transport their ashes to the mainland, one trip at a time. Every time he carries their remains home, he buys an individual seat for the urn, a gesture to show his respect for the dead. He also set up a mourning hall at his own home.In the past 15 years, it's reported that he has helped transport about 100 soldiers' remains to different provinces in the mainland, funded by donations. His footsteps have covered 80 percent of Chinese provinces.But his deeds haven't only earned him praise, but also criticism. Some people question Liu's motives. But Liu said that no matter what other people say about him, he will continue his mission without hesitation.

"China, El Salvador forge tiesnChina's Foreign Minister Wang Yi (right) and El Salvador's Foreign Minister Carlos Castaneda lead a toast during a signing ceremony in Beijing on Tuesday establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries. Photo: AFP China and El Salvador signed a joint communiqué in Beijing on Tuesday establishing diplomatic relations, making the Central American country the fifth nation to dump relations with Taiwan since the island's secessionist administration came to power in 2016. El Salvador is the third Latin American country to sever ties with Taiwan since July 2017, leading Chinese observers to note the milestone not only further isolates the island but also shows an irreversible trend. The communiqué was signed by Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Salvadorian counterpart Carlos Castaneda, according to the Xinhua News Agency. El Salvador ""recognizes that there is but one China in the world, that the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China, and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory,"" the communique read. According to the communiqué, El Salvador severs ""diplomatic relations"" with Taiwan as of this day and undertakes not to have any official relations or official exchanges with Taiwan. ""Adhering to the one-China principle is a universally recognized international norm and the consensus of the international community, as well as the fundamental foundation for China to establish and develop relations with any country,"" Wang said on Tuesday at the signing ceremony. ""El Salvador now stands with the overwhelming majority of countries in the world by resolutely deciding to recognize and make a commitment to abide by the one-China principle, and to establish diplomatic ties with China without preconditions,"" Wang noted. Around the world, 178 countries have established diplomatic ties with China, Wang said. ""El Salvador is a very important country in the Central American region. The Salvadorian government recognizes and promises to commit to the one-China principle, and cut its 'diplomatic ties' with Taiwan, which is the right choice in accordance with the trend, and in the interest of its people. China highly praises the decision,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said during a routine press conference on Tuesday. Lu also criticized Taiwan's accusation that China is using ""dollar diplomacy,"" saying that establishing ties with China is a decision made by the Salvadorian government based on the acknowledgement of the one-China principle, without any economic preconditions. Lu called on people in Taiwan to clearly recognize the worldwide trend, and stop seeing all things as related to money. Li Changhua, former Chinese ambassador to Costa Rica, on Tuesday hailed the establishment of China-El Salvador diplomatic ties as a ""milestone event,"" clearly indicating the international community's increasing opposition to ""Taiwan independence,"" and growing recognition and respect for the one-China principle. El Salvador's willingness to establish ties with China ""will show other countries in the region the way forward,"" Li noted. Only four countries in Central America - Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua - continue to shun China and buck the trend by maintaining ""diplomatic ties"" with the island of Taiwan. Delicate Timing El Salvador President Salvador Sanchez Ceren said on his twitter account late Monday that his country has established diplomatic ties with China, leaving only 17 countries worldwide that maintain ties with the island of Taiwan. Since pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party leader Tsai Ing-wen took office in early 2016, Taiwan has lost five ""diplomatic allies."" El Salvador's severing of ties with Taiwan comes just after Tsai finished her trip to Latin America and returned to Taiwan on Monday. The Taiwan authorities are surely embarrassed by the timing of El Salvador's decision, which is a blow to Tsai's plans of ""going aboard"" with her unseemly secessionist rhetoric, said Wang Peng, a researcher at the Institute of Latin American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""However, China-El Salvador ties are the fruit produced by years of comprehensive considerations between the two countries,"" Wang said. Li agrees, saying El Salvador expressed a strong desire to forge diplomatic ties with China when he was ambassador to Costa Rica and oversaw El Salvadorian affairs from 2009 to 2012. Wang dismissed Taiwan authorities' accusation that China had created debt problems in El Salvador to pressure the country to sever ties with the island, saying that ""there were no large-scale projects between the two before the establishment of ties."" Wang added that ""China-El Salvador relations will bring positive outcomes in every aspect, and the two governments are capable of managing and controlling debt."" "	8/21/18	0	0	0.9901	1
"After El Salvador, which country will be next to abandon Taiwan?nChina and El Salvador announced Tuesday morning their establishment of diplomatic relations. Earlier in the day, reports were heard from Taiwan that it broke off ""diplomatic"" ties with El Salvador. It is the fifth country Taiwan lost as a ""diplomatic ally"" since Taiwan leader Tsai came to office two years ago. Today, Taiwan is left with only 17 ""allies.""No one is surprised by the news, including the indignant Taiwan authority. Everyone knows that as the wave of ""diplomatic"" break-ups with Taiwan continues, El Salvador will not be the last. The only question is which country is next.Taiwan's ""foreign ministry"" noted Tuesday that El Salvador had been continuously asking for ""massive funding support"" since last year from Taiwan but that was denied, which led to today's ""diplomatic break."" This revealed that all Taiwan's ""diplomatic allies"" are maintained reluctantly by money. Such ties are hence deformed and in jeopardy.Some people suspect that the countries which abandoned Taiwan and built ties with the Chinese mainland were stolen by the latter paying more money. That is very old-fashioned thinking. When the Chinese mainland was weak, Taiwan was able to afford the competition of wealth, making small countries, which were picking sides across the Straits, see nothing but money.However, the situation across the Straits is no longer what it was. Cooperation with the Chinese mainland means huge quantities of opportunities, which cannot be replaced by money. Rather than being bought for a small amount of money by Taiwan - unrecognized internationally - it is increasingly becoming an indispensable pillar of a normal state's self-esteem and self-confidence to establish ties with Beijing.There is no need for the Chinese mainland to pay a fortune to steal Taiwan's ""allies."" Many of the island's ""allies"" have a larger trade volume with China than with Taiwan. Their establishment of diplomatic ties with the Chinese mainland is an irresistible trend. It is only a matter of time before Taiwan has zero ""allies.""Tsai's refusal to recognize the 1992 Consensus is leading Taiwan down a wrong path at a wrong time. It is not what Taiwan's authority said about its ""independent sovereignty"" that matters, but whether the international community acknowledges it. The Democratic Progressive Party has spared no effort in seeking international dignity, but the fact is its ""allies"" left it one after another, foreign airlines dropped references to Taiwan being a country, the East Asian Olympic Committee canceled Taichung's right to host the 2019 East Asian Youth Games and the World Health Organization and other international organizations are closing doors to the island.Taiwan will inevitably pay a heavy price for refusing to recognize the one-China policy. This is not a threat from Beijing, but a consequence of running counter to the trend. Taiwan will lose the whole game for not recognizing the 1992 Consensus. It is believed that its authority has no time to feel sad about losing El Salvador as it will soon be anxious and fearful evaluating which country comes next. "	8/21/18	0	1	-0.9926	-1
"Shares of 85 Cafe plunge, after its reception of pro-independence leader Tsai Ing-wen triggers boycottnShares of 85 Cafe plunge, after its reception of pro-independence leader Tsai Ing-wen triggers boycott Shares of 85 Cafe plunge, after its reception of pro-independence Tsai Shares of the parent company of the Taiwan-based chain 85 Degrees Celsius Bakery Café (85 Cafe) has plunged after the store's welcome of pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party leader Tsai Ing-wen sparked criticism in the Chinese mainland. Shares of Gourmet Master, the parent company of the 85 Cafe, on Friday plunged by the daily trading limit to NT$228 ($7.43). From Wednesday to Friday, the market value of Gourmet Master decline by more than 9 billion yuan, according to a Taiwan-based newspaper on August 17. An 85 cafe in Los Angeles welcomed Tsai during her recent visit to the city, where attendants took photos with her and gave her a present, according to media reports. The incident sparked a heated controversy among mainland customers, and later many domestic take-out food websites removed products and information regarding the bakery. 85 Cafe said on its Weibo account on Wednesday that the company opposes any behavior or comments that split cross-Straits compatriots. Apart from 85 cafe, a Taiwan-based hotel - the Four Points by Sheraton, reportedly cut relations with the hotel chain Marriott International after its online address was labeled ""Zhongguo Taiwan (China Taiwan)"" by Marriott's hotel booking website, which was a move to stress its pro-independence stance. The Global Times saw that there were about a dozen comments under one of the hotel's Weibo posts, criticizing its pro-independence attitude.

"New Chinese mainland dramas big hit among Hong Kong, Taiwan and overseas audiencesnPromotional material for Story of Yanxi Palace Photo: IC Huge hit dramas in the Chinese mainland such as Story of Yanxi Palace and Legend of Fuyao are also seeing great success in other areas of China as well as in overseas markets. Premiering on July 19 on Chinese streaming platform iQiyi, the Chinese period drama Story of Yanxi Palace has been one of the most talked-about topics on Chinese social media over the past month. Set during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the show follows the story of an imperial court maid who manages to become one of the Qianlong Emperor's favorite concubines. The 70-episode show, which set a single-day viewership record for a series drama in the Chinese mainland with 530 million views, also simultaneously debuted on iQiyi's Taiwan site to a record-breaking 1 million views in its first week, according to local newspaper the Taipei Times. Hong Kong's TVB also bought the rights to air the show in Hong Kong (on August 6), Macau, Singapore and Malaysia, the South China Morning Post reported. Discussion and comparison ""This drama's visuals are the prettiest I've ever seen in a mainland drama"" and ""Its storyline and characterization as well as its setting and costumes are based on real history and watching this show really helps increase my knowledge"" are just some of the popular reviews the drama has on TVB's site. Hong Kong actress Charmaine Sheh's performance in the show as the emperor's evil concubine-turned-empress has also received a lot of thumbs-up from local fans. The mainland drama's improved production quality has also sparked worries among Hong Kong netizens about the declining quality of their own local dramas. ""TVB's period dramas are incomparable to those produced by the mainland; just look at the visuals, the beautiful and exquisite setting and costumes in Story of Yanxi Palace makes Deep In the Realm of Conscience [TVB's latest period drama] look cheap by comparison,"" commented netizen sputnik101 on the TVB site. Once a major producer of acclaimed period dramas in Asia, TVB in recent years has witnessed decreasing influence as well as a loss of some of its most well-known stars and producers - many of whom have chosen to pursue careers in the mainland. Overseas popularity Since Story of Yanxi Palace is yet to release official English-subs, many overseas drama fans have left messages on Twitter and YouTube under the show's clips and trailers asking for them. Aside from Story of Yanxi Palace, a new Chinese web drama, Bloody Romance, has also gained in popularity overseas recently. The show's first episode released on YouTube in late July with English subtitles and obtained nearly 1 million views in two weeks. ""I am not a huge fan of the Ancient Chinese dramas, but this one is turning out pretty good for just the first episode. I am really liking the story and the characters,"" commented YouTube user Wicked Ahjumma. Moreover, Chinese period romance drama Legend of Fuyao, which began airing on overseas streaming platforms including Viki and DramaFever in June, has also captured attention from foreign fans and media. The drama ""is being appreciated by Pakistani audiences, owing to the catchy storyline and visual scenes,"" wrote a report from newspaper Daily Pakistan in late June before going on to praise the show as ""a wonderful presentation of Chinese characteristics."" ""Legend of Fuyao has topped our drama viewing charts since its debut on DramaFever; it has surpassed the performance of other period pieces on our platform in 2018,"" Rena Liu, vice president of DramaFever, a division of Warner Bros Digital Labs, told the Global Times via an email interview. The overseas popularity of the show's two lead stars, Yang Mi and Ethan Juan, as well as its storyline ""merging elements of fantasy, a strong and capable female heroine with an intricate romance story"" are the reasons Liu says that the work might appeal to their user base, which is 70 percent non-Asian. Opportunities and challenges The rise in popularity of Chinese dramas among overseas audiences has been significant, especially over the past two years, which in turn has increased demand for these shows in overseas markets. ""We've increased our volume [of Chinese dramas] accordingly. Prior to 2016, almost no Chinese titles reached our weekly top 10 in viewership, whereas our Chinese shows consistently rank among the weekly top 10 now,"" Liu noted. However, Liu believes there is still a long way to go before Chinese dramas reach the level of popularity that parallels that of South Korean series. One of the major obstacles is length, as many of the negative feedbacks from their users about Chinese dramas focus on ""the length and dragging storylines."" ""Chinese dramas typically exceed 50 episodes. This creates a very challenging barrier of entry, since Western audiences who watch with subtitles often prefer more efficient storytelling,"" Liu wrote. "	8/16/18	0	0	0.9983	1
"Taiwan-based 85 Cafe may face boycott in the mainland, urged to recognize 1992 ConsensusnTaiwan-based 85 Cafe may face boycott in the mainland, urged to recognize 1992 Consensus Taiwan-based chain 85 Degrees Celsius Bakery Café (85 Cafe) has sparked criticism in the Chinese mainland, after one of its US stores warmly welcomed Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen, who leads the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party. Tsai visited an 85 Café in Los Angeles, where servers took photos with Tsai and give her a present with her name and a date on it, media reports said. This sparked mainland people's anger, as they believe the store supports Tsai's “Taiwan independence” policy. On its official website, the company lists China as an overseas stronghold, along with the US and Australia. Meanwhile, on the page showing Global Locations, the Chinese characters ""Zhongguo (China)"" had been changed to ""Dalu (mainland)"" as of Tuesday, but the English version still said ""China."" To ease criticism, 85 Cafe said in a statement on its Sina Weibo account that the company supports the 1992 Consensus and opposes any behavior and words that split cross-Straits compatriots. The 1992 Consensus is an agreement between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland to adhere to the one-China principle. But the statement was neither posted on its Taiwan official website nor its overseas social accounts such as Facebook. Thus, many believe that 85 Cafe made this statement only to cope with mainland internet users' anger rather than showing its stance outside the mainland. ""85 Cafe seems to hope to gain interests from both sides across the Straits. It wants to get commercial interests from the mainland, while essentially, it supports Tsai's policy that hinders the peaceful reunification of China,"" Wang Yong, an associate professor at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Taiwan-based companies operating in the mainland should recognize the 1992 Consensus, otherwise they will be punished, he said. On the company's Sina Weibo account, mainland internet users called for a boycott of 85 Cafe and said that it should retreat from the mainland. ""The far-fetched statement is absurd and pathetic. Since the company advocates Taiwan independence, why doesn't it retreat from the mainland?…"" a network user named ChenxiangfaMister said. ""85 Cafe makes money in the mainland, but does things that harm the mainland. What a trashy company!"" ""It's doesn't matter if we don't eat cakes at 85 Cafe. After all, there are many bakery stores,"" mainland internet users said. On Wednesday, the Global Times noticed that mainland popular online catering service platforms such as Meituan and Eleme had removed 85 Cafe from their platforms. According to media reports, 85 Cafe has a total of 589 stores in the mainland. 85 Cafe couldn't be reached by the Global Times for comment on Wednesday. "	8/15/18	0	0	0.8954	1

"PLA begins E.China Sea drillnPLA begins E.China Sea drill Exercises coincide with Tsai’s S.America trip The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) began military exercises on Friday in waters near East China's Shandong Province, which coincided with Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen's plan to fly to Paraguay on Sunday with stopovers in the US and attracted attentions on both sides of the Taiwan Straits. Experts said that the military exercises are aimed at practicing combat capability in the event it has to deal with Taiwan separatists. China Maritime Safety Administration released a notice on its website on early Friday, saying that the PLA would conduct significant military exercises from Friday to Monday in waters of the Yellow Sea and all boats and ships are banned from entering restricted areas for safety reasons. The exercises began at 6:00 pm on Friday and will end at 6:00 am on Monday. The restricted zone extends from the northeast maritime areas of Rizhao to the southeast maritime areas of Qiangdao in Shandong, according to pictures released from the China Maritime Safety Administration on Friday. Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Friday that the exercises may aim to increase the combat capability of the PLA Navy Beihai Fleet and other troops stationed nearby. ""Previous exercises in the East China Sea aimed at dealing with Taiwan separatists and the purpose has not changed for exercises taking place in the Yellow Sea,"" Song said. The PLA conducted a live-fire military drill in the East China Sea in July in an area similar in size to the island of Taiwan, a move analysts believe would send a strong warning to Taiwan separatists. The six-day exercise started on July 18 and ended on July 23. Vessels were prohibited from entering the designated live-fire drill area to ensure safety, read a notice released by Zhejiang Maritime Safety Administration on July 16. The PLA is also likely to practice how to deal with possible interference from Japan and the US, if the Chinese mainland is forced to deal with the Taiwan question, Song said. The news on Friday's military exercises has troubled Taiwan authorities as Tsai is reportedly preparing stopovers in two US cities on her way to and from Latin America beginning on Sunday. Tsai will pass through Los Angeles on her way to Paraguay and through Houston on her return journey from Belize in Central America, the Taiwan-based EBC News reported on Wednesday. Only 18 countries around the world has ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan. Ten of them are South and Central American countries. Yang Lixian, a specially appointed research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center on Cross-Straits Relations, said that ""Tsai's plane needs to refuel in the US as she hurries to rescue and strengthen ties with countries in South and Central America, which are among a dwindling number of countries that are 'friends of Taiwan.'"" Tsai may use her short stay in the US to meet with some US officials and pro-Taiwan independence politicians, which the Chinese mainland firmly opposes, Yang told the Global Times. Geng Shuang, spokesperson of China's Foreign Ministry told a press briefing on July 31 that ""we urge the US to respect the 'one-China policy' and not give permission for Tsai to stopover in the US."" ""The US should not send a wrong signal to Taiwan and should take real action to protect China-US ties and the stability of the area,"" said Geng. In response to the PLA's military exercises on Friday, Huang Chung-yen, spokesperson from the Taiwan authorities was quoted by EBC News on Friday as saying that Taiwan's military has ""closely followed"" the PLA's activities and made countermeasures. Experts said on Friday that the Chinese mainland opposes any activity that would jeopardize the cross-Straits tie and the PLA's exercises always aim at protecting the country's interests. Yang said that conducting military exercises has become routine training of the PLA and the purpose of the exercises is quite clear - to fight any separatist forces, to protect the country's integrity and sovereignty and safeguard its unification.

"China should ‘strike back’ at US Senate billnChina should prepare to strike back at the US with countermeasures, even a showdown, to quash US interference in cross-Straits ties, Chinese experts warned after the US Senate passed a defense bill that would improve Taiwan's self-defense capabilities by expanding joint training. By an 87-10 vote, the US Senate on Wednesday approved the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2019, after the US House of Representatives approved it last week, and US President Trump is expected to sign the bill into law. On the Taiwan question, several of the bill's provisions call for the strengthening of the defense partnership with the island. It suggests improving Taiwan's self-defense capabilities by expanding joint training, military equipment sales, the use of security cooperation authorities, and senior-level military-to-military engagement. It also proposes sending a service secretary or member of the Joint Chiefs to Taiwan for senior-level defense engagement under the Taiwan Travel Act. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said on Thursday that China discussed the bill with the US several times, and ""we urge the US side to discard the outdated Cold War and zero-sum game mentality."" China urges the US not to allow the bill to become law, much less to be implemented, Geng said, stressing that ""China firmly opposes official interaction and military relationship between any country and Taiwan."" ""It is mere a trick to pressure China and increase its bargaining power with the Chinese mainland amid rising tensions between Beijing and Washington on trade,"" Yang Lixian, a specially-appointed research fellow at the Beijing-based Research Center on Cross-Strait Relations, told the Global Times on Thursday. Trump, a shrewd businessman, will not easily cross the red line and trade China-US ties for the relationship between the US and Taiwan, Yang noted. ""But China should always prepare to strike back with countermeasures and insist the firm determination to safeguard national unity."" Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, said the Chinese military is always prepared for a crisis in the Taiwan Straits and is not afraid of reunifying the island by force. ""China faces a huge threat from US interference in the Taiwan Straits. The US will strengthen its military connection with the island and soon establish an information-sharing system in Taiwan,"" Song said. Although the bill deleted the part of ""participation in appropriate Taiwan exercises, such as the annual Han Kuang exercise"" previously seen in the draft, it does not mean the US will give up its ambition to conduct more joint military actions, Song added. ""China will closely watch what the US does, and once the US crosses the red line by sending military forces or equipment to the island, even supporting Taiwan independence, China will risk everything to protect its own territorial integrity."" Dangerous trend Analysts pointed out that in the past, the US' previous engagement in defense cooperation with the island of Taiwan usually maintains a low profile, but things are changing now. Security collaboration between the US and the island of Taiwan is increasing, and some of it has been made public. Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, recently tweeted that ""Taiwan will join US navy drills in the Solomon Islands as part of Pacific Partnership. Not the first time, but now being announced publicly."" In the past two years, the Pentagon has stressed the US' commitment to arms sales to Taiwan. Washington has also granted the marketing license for the sale of submarine technology to the island. In early July, Washington sent two US destroyers through the Taiwan Straits, which is a gesture that many observers believe is directed at China-US ties and the Taiwan question. Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen is relying more heavily on US protection. After Trump announced the US' Indo-Pacific strategy, Tsai has sought to participate in it and play a special role in military and security affairs. "	8/2/18	0	0	0.9784	1
"US deploying Marines in AIT will backfirenIllustration: Liu Rui/GT A report in Taiwan media over the weekend revealed that Washington has informed senior officials of Taiwan's ""Ministry of National Defense"" that US Marines will be sent to safeguard the American Institute in Taiwan's (AIT) new complex in Taipei in September. Since the beginning of this year, speculation about posting Marines to the AIT has been swirling, but the US did not confirm it. The move can spark a crisis in the Taiwan Straits. The US has a long history of dispatching Marines to embassies and consulates in foreign countries. Since the end of World War II, it has become an institutional arrangement to station Marines at missions. Called Marine Security Guards (MSGs), the troopers are on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The primary mission of MSGs is to prevent the compromise of classified US government information rather than protect the embassy and diplomatic personnel. In view of the relatively good public security situation in Taipei, the AIT faces neither daunting security risks nor the chance of theft or break-in. Stationing Marines at the AIT would mean that Washington recognizes the facility as an embassy, which is a blatant violation of the US' one-China policy and is obviously contrary to the commitments in the three communiqués between the two countries. The deployment of Marines would be more damaging to ties than the passage of the Taiwan Travel Act. The US aims to contain China by playing the Taiwan card. Since Donald Trump assumed power, it has frequently made an issue of the Taiwan question, keeping challenging the bottom line of the mainland's cross-Straits policy. As the China-US trade war is in full swing, voices pushing Washington to play the Taiwan card are growing within the US. America's Taiwan policy is undergoing a profound change. No matter how the White House explains it or how US public opinion interprets it, sending Marines to Taiwan will beyond all doubt be regarded by China as a belligerent act of the US to challenge the situation in the Taiwan Straits. The question is, with only one month left, will the US roll back the decision. If the US fails to do so, it's imperative China act to warn it. China needs to advise the US to think twice before acting. The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council has repeatedly said that it is firmly opposed to any form of official exchange and contacts between the US and Taiwan. Washington should not regard it as mere rhetoric. China should clarify the seriousness of the matter to the Trump administration and the US Congress through various channels. Once the US Marines are posted to the new AIT complex, China will take corresponding measures that go beyond verbal warning. In response to provocation by Taiwan authorities since the beginning of this year, the mainland has carried out live-fire exercises and sent aircraft carriers to sail through the Taiwan Straits. Recently, the right to host East Asian Youth Games in Taichung has been revoked due to the promotion of a proposed referendum on whether Taiwan should participate in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games as ""Taiwan"" rather than its standard Olympic name of ""Chinese Taipei"" within the island. Attempts of US airlines to delay the revision of the way they refer to Taiwan ended up in failure. Washington should learn from these issues. The tit-for-tat approach is the most effective way to deal with US provocations. In response to some US politicians repeatedly challenging the one-China policy, Beijing can blacklist them. The Trump administration has comprehensively adjusted its China policy and launched strategic competition with China. The ongoing trade war is a prominent manifestation of the US' tough policy against China. We have reasons to believe that Trump, with his unconventional style, will not hesitate to play the Taiwan card to contain China. But it will be of no help in pressuring China but instead prove counterproductive. The Chinese government will safeguard national unity at all costs and there is no room for compromise on the issue. Under US provocation, Taiwan authorities have been unbridled in challenging the one-China consensus. With regard to the issue of US Marines, the mainland needs to make the island realize that provocation cannot win them benefits but will lead to bitter consequences.

"Marines in AIT not leverage for TaiwannThe Liberty Times of Taiwan reported Sunday that Washington has informed senior officials of Taiwan's "" Ministry of National Defense "" that the US will in September post Marines at the American Institute in Taiwan's (AIT) new complex in Taipei. This has triggered collective follow-up reports by Taiwan media.The speculation that US Marines might be sent to the new AIT site for security work emerged a few months ago. Only US embassies and consulates are guarded by Marines. Posting US Marines to the AIT would mean a public US declaration that the AIT is equivalent to a US embassy or consulate instead of a non-governmental institution. But Washington has not confirmed the report. AIT responded that security arrangements at its new office compound will be the same as at the current site.The information about possible new security arrangements of the AIT was mostly reported by Taiwan media. They usually quote sources anonymously. Most of these reports bedimmed one detail: If the Marines are to be stationed at the AIT, will they wear Marine uniforms or casual clothes? Will they publicly manifest their identities, change to another identity or simply blur the issue?Taiwan's pro-independence activists strongly hope that US Marines will fully showcase their identity so as to proclaim that the AIT is no different from other US embassies and consulates as well as to prove that the island is an ""independent sovereign country."" The separatist forces in Taiwan have suffered from multiple strikes from the Chinese mainland recently. They are hoping to lift the morale of their camp through hyping topics related to the AIT.Whether to send Marines to the AIT, under what name the US should send them and what should they wear: The tactical initiative is in Washington's hands. But the strategic initiative is not necessarily in its hands.If the US stirs up trouble over the case and makes extreme arrangements, it knows how Beijing will respond. Beijing has an increasing number of countermeasures which Washington will have to confront. It could then turn into an escalation of Sino-US friction and the White House cannot be certain about effective control.If the US Marines publicly station at the AIT in their uniforms, that would be treated by Beijing as a severe subversion of the one-China policy or even an invasion of the US military of Chinese soil. The AIT would also be regarded as a primary stronghold for the US invasion of China. Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen's administration would be defined as a traitorous group. That being said, from a strategic perspective, the AIT would become the most insecure place in Taiwan and a blasting fuse for clashes.The AIT has never been a real non-governmental institution. Many US people who stationed there are diplomats, intelligence staff, military officers and experts. The new AIT complex is larger and will play a more important role in a tough China strategy by the US. But there is still a difference between offending openly and not doing so.The status of Taiwan and posture of China-US relations are not shaped by a few petty tricks. "	7/29/18	0	1	0.7302	1
"China still considering measures against US airlines with Taiwan listing changes not completenChina still considering measures against US airlines with Taiwan listing changes not complete Changes to US airline websites ‘not complete’ The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) is still considering whether to take measures against four US airlines if the changes to their websites do not advance further, the agency said on a public statement on Thursday. As the deadline passed on Wednesday, 40 out of 44 overseas airlines had changed their references to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao in accordance with Chinese law, with only four, all US-based, airlines remaining, according to CAAC. United Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Hawaiian Airlines all delivered their reports to the CAAC on Wednesday, where they declared the changes to their public documents are progressively coming online, and asked the authorities to inspect their websites after two weeks. As of Thursday, all US-based airlines had removed mentions of ""Taiwan"" as a country when searching for cities on the island on their websites. But Delta Airlines and United Airlines also removed mentions of ""China"" as a country when searching even for cities on the Chinese mainland. American Airlines kept mentions of China when searching for cities in the mainland, but did not mention Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan cities as belonging to China. The CAAC statement noted that after a preliminary inspection, the websites of the four airlines have indeed changed their content, but it deemed the changes to be ""still not complete."" The agency vowed to continue to follow closely the case and will decide whether to take administrative measures depending on the circumstances. A representative of US-based United Airlines told Global Times that the airline had already begun to roll out changes to its systems to address China's requirements.

"US airlines fix Taiwan referencenAll the 44 international airlines, including US airlines, have revised the way they refer to the island of Taiwan, according to updates of the airlines' websites on Wednesday. An expert said the US government is aware that the one-China policy is the bottom line. Among them, four US airlines - Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, United Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines — were the latest to make the changes, just hours before the deadline. They were expected to make the changes by the end of July 25. Hawaiian Airlines removed ""Taiwan"" from its schedules on Tuesday. On Wednesday morning, American Airlines followed suit after the company's spokesperson Shannon Gilson told the Global Times via email, ""We are consulting the US government on the matter."" Delta Air Lines and United Airlines also made similar moves. Delta retained the names of cities on the island, such as ""Taipei,"" but removed ""Taiwan"" after the cities' names to avoid identifying the island as a country, as it indicated Taiwan in the column of ""countries and regions"" on the schedule chart. Geng Shuang, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on Wednesday commended the actions taken by the US airlines, and urged foreign companies operating in China to abide by Chinese laws and regulations. ""We have noticed some positive progress, and appreciate rectifications made by foreign airlines. China is willing to share our development opportunities with foreign companies and welcome foreign companies to invest in China,"" Geng told a regular press conference, stressing that ""we also hope that when they [foreign companies] operate in China, they respect China's laws and regulations, respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and respect the feelings of the Chinese people."" ""We will also protect their legitimate rights and interests in accordance with the law and create a fair environment for their operations,"" Geng said. On April 25, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) asked 44 foreign airlines to modify references to Taiwan on their websites and maps to identify it as a region of China within 30 days. Twenty-six of the 44 foreign airlines applied for an extension on May 25, the initial deadline, citing technical reasons. The deadline was moved to July 25. Emirates not only revised its reference to Taiwan, listed Taiwan in the ""tourist destination introduction"" section on its website, along with other Chinese cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Zhengzhou, capital of Central China's Henan Province. Geng stressed that adhering to the one-China policy is the political basis for the stable development of China-US relations, and hoped that the US government would urge American companies to abide by the one-China principle, rather than 'squat.' Diao Daming, an American studies expert and associate professor at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the action taken by US airlines after consultations with their government showed the US government is aware that the one-China policy is China's bottom line, and that it is non-negotiable. China has reiterated its stance several times. ""We can negotiate on trade matters, but will never compromise on the Taiwan question under any condition,"" Diao noted, adding that the US did the right thing this time. Experts added that China was adamant this time. ""Let's wait and see,"" Geng said on Tuesday when asked whether US airlines would be banned from Chinese airports if they fail to meet the requirement. The US government initially took a tough stance. In a statement released on May 5, the US government called China's request to change the way Taiwan is referred to as ""Orwellian nonsense."" It also said ""we call on China to stop threatening and coercing American carriers and citizens."" ""It's still unclear whether the US will stop provoking China on the Taiwan question, but at least this time, the US refused to pay the price,"" Diao said. "	7/25/18	0	0	0.9802	1

Gilson stressed that American Airlines has until Wednesday to comply, since the company requested and received a 60-day extension in May.""We hope that the US government will urge relevant enterprises to abide by the one-China principle and make rectification as soon as possible,"" Geng said.According to the Civil Aviation Administration of China's earlier notice, 26 out of the 44 foreign airlines applied for extensions on May 25, the initial deadline, citing technical reasons. The final completion time was set for Wednesday.Air France, Qantas and other international airlines that failed to complete the modification as of May 25 have now done so.Emirates not only revised its reference to Taiwan, but also listed Taiwan in the ""tourist destination introduction"" section on its website, along with other Chinese cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Zhengzhou, capital of Central China's Henan Province.Zhang Baoxin, an expert at China Aviation News, said that ""for those that still refuse to change the wording by Wednesday, the Chinese authorities might impose restrictions on their navigation rights in China. Booking systems, such as apps of these companies, might also be removed in the Chinese market based on laws.""In a statement on May 5, the US government called China's request to change the way Taiwan is referred to as ""Orwellian nonsense.""

"Is US firm about confronting China on Taiwan?nIs US firm about confronting China on Taiwan? A spokesperson of the US State Department said Monday that the US remains committed to the one-China policy, the three China-US joint communiqués and its responsibilities under the Taiwan Relations Act. He also stated that the long-term relationship established under the act was a unique asset of the US and doubles its regional influence, adding Washington supports Taiwan's efforts to ""develop innovative and asymmetric capabilities to deter coercion or intimidation."" ""We encourage Taiwan to increase its defense budget to a level commensurate with the security challenges it confronts,"" the spokesperson said. During a CNN interview, Taiwan ""foreign minister"" Joseph Wu accused the Chinese mainland of intimidating the Taiwanese people. ""[If] the Chinese see the vulnerability of Taiwan, not getting US support, then they would be thinking about starting scenarios where they would be able to take Taiwan over,"" he said. The recent remarks of the US State Department spokesperson were a response to Wu. Interactions between the US and Taiwan are increasing. Since US President Donald Trump won the presidency, he has shown a strong willingness to use the island as a card to force Beijing to make concessions in other aspects. Washington passed the Taiwan Travel Act in February, which paved the way for future use of Taiwan as a bargaining chip. It is believed that the White House would not be that silly as to actually think it can do something big in terms of Taiwan. The island is China's core interest. The rising strength of the People's Liberation Army in recent years has shaken the previously absolute military superiority of the US in the region. If Washington broke its promise on the one-China policy, it would pay a huge price. We don't believe the Trump administration has the determination. Sending a wrong signal to Taiwan, encouraging Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen's authority to take a radical path, the US may temporarily cause trouble for the Chinese mainland. But Taiwan alone cannot be a force to strategically contain the Chinese mainland. Eventually it would become a China-US confrontation. The island needs to realize that Washington is not determined to strategically collide with Beijing in the Taiwan Straits. If Taiwan crosses the red line of the Anti-Secession Law, it will to a large extent face punishment from the Chinese mainland alone. In that case, the US would probably provide it with some moral support, some military equipment that needed to be paid for, no more. Interactions between the US and Taiwan must be controlled within the limits of the Chinese mainland's tolerance. When it comes to US-Taiwan joint military exercises, port visits to the island by US warships, high-level exchanges between the two, high-ranking US military officials wandering Taiwan streets like they do in South Korea, Taiwan should not even think about it. Because that would be the prelude to the end of Taiwan separation. It is to be hoped that Taiwan's authority can cherish the peace across the Straits, instead of constantly testing the authority of the Anti-Secession Law. Taiwan independence may be a piece of cheese that it keeps thinking about. But it is no more than bait on a mousetrap. A wise choice would be not to touch it. "	7/24/18	0	0	0.9001	1
"US official's call for closer military ties with Taiwan heightens tensions: analystnA speech by a senior US defense official calling for closer military ties with the island of Taiwan is a provocation and an attempt to disrupt China's efforts amid trade tensions with the US, Chinese analysts said on Thursday. Randall Schriver, US Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs, called for ""strengthening military ties with Taiwan to counter pressure from China,"" at a symposium in Washington on Wednesday, NHK reported. He said that the Chinese mainland has been pressuring the island by flying bombers and repeated military exercises off its coast, the Japanese TV news website reported. US military and defense support for the island, including sales of arms, should continue, Schriver said. Earlier this month, two US Navy ships conducted a ""routine transit through the international waters of the Taiwan Straits,"" Reuters reported, citing US defense officials. ""When other countries try to avoid involving themselves in sensitive waters, the US move of entering the Taiwan Straits is a provocation against China,"" said Zhang Hua, an assistant research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. Taiwan is used as a bargaining chip for US strategy toward China, Zhang said. ""It's a delusion if the US expects to jangle China's nerves with such provocations amid ongoing trade tensions,"" Zhang said. ""China will fight back if the US takes any further action."" Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman, told the South China Morning Post that ""the US Navy from time to time will transit from East China Sea to South China Sea through that area for multiple different operational reasons."" Zhang said it showed that the Chinese mainland's methods were ""working"" as now Taiwan separatists felt the deterrence and are stepping up efforts to seek US help. The US is attempting to pressure China with the Taiwan question while the US and China are immersed in trade tensions, Liu Weidong, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. Whenever relations between the US and China intensify, the US plays the Taiwan card against China and also other cards including the South China Sea and human rights, Liu noted on Thursday. ""But the US won't support Taiwan independence. It is only playing on the edges as Taiwan is not worth the US engaging China in military conflict,"" Liu said. The People's Liberation Army has been conducting live-fire military drills in the East China Sea since Wednesday, with military experts saying they are tailored toward ""Taiwan independence"" forces. Countries have been cutting ties with Taiwan and turning to the Chinese mainland instead, Taiwan News reported. Eighteen countries hold ""diplomatic relations"" with Taiwan, the Taipei-based paper said. "	7/19/18	0	0	0.0647	1
"PLA drill in East China Sea ‘tailored for Taiwan separatists’nChina's People's Liberation Army (PLA) will conduct a live-fire military drill in the East China Sea from Wednesday to Monday in an area that is similar in size to the island of Taiwan, a move analysts believe will send a strong warning to Taiwan separatists. The six-day exercise will start on Wednesday at 8:00 am and is due to end at 6:00 pm on July 23. Unrelated vessels are prohibited from entering the designated live-fire drill area and must follow the guidance of guard ships to ensure safety, reads a notice released by Zhejiang Maritime Safety Administration on Monday. According to the coordinates provided by the administration, the drill zone spans from sea areas close to east of Zhoushan, East China's Zhejiang Province to sea areas east of Wenzhou, also in Zhejiang Province. The drill zone has a similar size to the island of Taiwan. The drill is designed to warn the ""Taiwan independence"" forces, Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday. ""The drill's main objective is to send a serious warning to Taiwan separatists,"" Song said. The East China Sea will be a main battlefield if war takes place in the future, as it is key to solving the Taiwan question and other disputed island issues, a military expert, who asked not to be named, told the Global Times on Tuesday. If the drill zone were to be pushed forward, it would basically cover the entire island of Taiwan, the expert noted. ""The PLA Air Force and Navy have been frequently conducting island encirclement exercises. The drill this time will add up and form a military deterrence of high pressure against the Taiwan separatists,"" according to Song. Considering duration and size of the drill zone, the exercise is a large-scale one that requires more troops and weapons, the anonymous expert said, adding that the drill will test the PLA's systematic combat capability, tactics, training methods and capacities of its weaponry and equipment. The drill will be a joint operation with high complexity in a bid to simulate real combat. The PLA's capability to quickly carry out combat missions will be improved, said Song.

"Xi Jinping meets with Taiwan delegation led by Lien ChannXi Jinping meets with Taiwan delegation led by Lien Chan Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, on Friday met here a delegation of people from various sectors in Taiwan, led by former chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT) party Lien Chan. The pursuit of a just cause and people's common aspirations is unstoppable, said Xi during the meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. ""We have the confidence and ability to keep a firm hold on the correct direction, work for the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, and advance the process toward the peaceful reunification of China,"" Xi said. Xi called on compatriots on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to work together to uphold the 1992 Consensus, which embodies the one-China principle, and to resolutely oppose and deter ""Taiwan independence."" He also called for joint efforts by both sides to expand and deepen cross-Strait exchange and cooperation in various fields, improve the kinship among compatriots and their wellbeing, and ""jointly write the new chapter of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."" ""Once seeing through a long-term perspective and with a broad vision, compatriots from the two sides of the Strait would grasp the big picture of cross-Strait relations and overcome difficulties to push it forward,"" Xi said. ""We have full confidence in the future of cross-Strait relations,"" he said. The confidence was based on the reason that the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and joint efforts to realize national rejuvenation is the right path ""in line with interests of the whole nation and the tide of the times, which will benefit compatriots from the two sides and gain their support,"" he said. It was also because, despite ups and downs in cross-Strait relations, people from the two sides have never been separated emotionally, and in their nationality and cultural identity, and the general trend of ties is moving forward, Xi said. The two sides of the Strait belong to ""an inseparable community of shared future that stands together through thick and thin,"" he said. ""No one can stop the common aspiration of compatriots on the two sides for a better life and closer and more favorable cross-Strait relations,"" he said. Noting that the right path should be upheld, Xi urged people of the two sides to have stronger faith and show solidarity, particularly under the current situation. The 1992 Consensus should be upheld and ""Taiwan independence"" should be opposed, he said. ""We will never allow any attempts of 'Taiwan independence' to succeed. Such attempts are doomed to fail,"" Xi said, urging people from the two sides to firmly oppose and deter activities of ""Taiwan independence"" with concrete action. Cross-Strait exchange and cooperation should be expanded and intensified, he said, adding that disagreement between people of the two sides on some issues should not hold back regular exchange and cooperation nor become an excuse to stand in the way. ""Compatriots across the Strait should show empathy, stand in each other's shoes and understand each other better so as to forge closer bonds,"" he said. The welfare of people across the Strait should be promoted, he said. Now, when national rejuvenation is heading toward a brighter future, the nation has a stronger ability and better conditions to improve compatriots' welfare, Xi said. Promising to provide equal treatment for Taiwanese people and businesses in the mainland, he said more policies will be issued, following the 31 measures adopted in February to promote cross-Strait economic and cultural cooperation and exchange. Compatriots across the Strait should be united to work for national rejuvenation, Xi said, stressing that Taiwanese people should not and will not be absent from the cause. People across the Strait should follow the tide of history, work together for the greater national interests, jointly promote peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, advance the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland, and realize the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation, Xi said. Lien proposed upholding the one-China principle, promoting peaceful cross-Strait relations and mutually beneficial integration, and revitalizing the Chinese nation. In 2005, the two parties issued a five-point consensus on the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, endorsing the 1992 Consensus while opposing ""Taiwan independence,"" which helped get the cross-Strait relations on the right track of peaceful development, Lien said. The current situation in the Taiwan Strait has been destabilized and is causing harm to the security and wellbeing of Taiwan residents, Lien noted. ""People from the two sides both belong to the Chinese nation who went through both good and hard times together,"" Lien said, calling on them to abandon internal rifts and work together to pursue peaceful cross-Strait relations and shared prosperity across the Strait. The two sides should consolidate political mutual trust and restart dialogue on the basis of the 1992 Consensus, and address, step by step, political differences left over by history, he said. Lien called on the two sides to promote economic cooperation, cultural and people-to-people exchanges, expand mutual benefits, enhance the kinship between people across the Strait, and continuously increase integration to realize rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

"Chinese military ‘closely monitored’ US warships sailing through Taiwan Straits: expertnChinese military ‘closely monitored’ US warships sailing through Taiwan Straits: expert A US Navy official confirmed that two US warships passed through the Taiwan Straits between Saturday and Sunday. Chinese experts told the Global Times that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) had most likely monitored their movements closely. ""Two US Navy ships conducted a routine transit through the international waters of the Taiwan Straits on July 7-8 (local time),"" Captain Charlie Brown, a spokesman for the US Pacific Fleet, was quoted by Reuters as saying in a statement on Sunday. ""US Navy Ships transit between the South China Sea and East China Sea via the Taiwan Straits and have done so for many years,"" he said, according to Reuters. Taiwan's ""defense ministry"" said on Saturday that the two US warships are Burke Class Destroyers USS Mustin and USS Benfold, reported Taipei-based newspaper Liberty Times on Saturday. The PLA Navy must have monitored the entire situation and had it under control, a Chinese military expert, who asked not to be named, told the Global Times on Saturday. The warships' presence has aggravated tensions across the Taiwan Straits amid a sensitive period concerning the Taiwan question and the China-US trade dispute, the expert said. The move is a signal from the US to Taiwan authorities, telling them not to be afraid, the expert noted. PLA Navy warships conducted an island encirclement exercise around Taiwan last month. ""Many signs show that the US is not directing against China in one specific aspect, but on a series of issues,"" the expert said. ""The US is launching operations against China that not only involve military and security, but also trade and diplomacy,"" he said, adding that the US' strategy on China has changed over the past year. The US has label China as a ""strategic competitor."" In response to reports that US was considering sending a warship through the Taiwan Straits in early June, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on June 5 that the US should prudently handle the Taiwan question so as to avoid harming bilateral ties and peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits region. ""The Taiwan question is the most important and sensitive core issue in China-US relations,"" Hua said. Newspaper headline: PLA ‘monitors’ US warships movement "	7/8/18	0	0	-0.7396	-1
"US warships play psychological game in Taiwan StraitsnUS warships play psychological game in Taiwan Straits Washington sailed two US destroyers through the Taiwan Straits on Saturday, a gesture that many believe is directed at China-US ties and the Taiwan question. Increased trade tensions between Beijing and Washington and Tsai Ing-wen administration's constant provocations have put further strain on the cross-Straits situation. Now, Washington has put warships to the show in the West Pacific region. The Pentagon told the media last month that the country would sail warships through the Taiwan Straits, triggering a round of media speculations. It now appears that Washington has chosen a more discreet approach: It opted for sending destroyers instead of aircraft carriers at the weekend, no drills were conducted, and the US military hasn't officially announced the voyage. Since a vast stretch of the Taiwan Straits is considered an international waterway, Beijing cannot raise the issue if Washington's passage is uneventful. However, in most cases, the US is sending political signals by sending warships through the Taiwan Straits. Although this time Washington has remained relatively low key, the Taiwan administration has continued to issue statements. Apparently, the Democratic Progressive Party has been emboldened by Washington's gestures. International media has linked the passage with Sino-US tensions aggravated by the ongoing trade war, while observers are concerned whether these tensions would spread to other fields. Beijing should stay strategically composed, respond to Washington's actions in accordance with international laws and China's interests, and avoid being misled by the Taiwan administration and Western public opinion. In the future, Washington may send larger warships to the Taiwan Straits, conduct military training and drills, and even collaborate with Taiwan's military in an attempt to deter the mainland. But Washington will not succeed. The mainland's military strength has improved greatly since the 1996 crisis and is capable of countermeasures to deter Washington and the Taiwan administration from provocations. PLA warplanes can make adjustments to the distances of their flight paths around Taiwan, cross the ""middle line"" and even fly over the island if necessary. US warships can pass through the Straits freely, but can also be sandwiched between PLA vessels. Politics between China and the US is sophisticated and subtle. As long as China remains capable and resourceful, it can take the lead in cross-Straits affairs. The Taiwan question is among China's core interests, and Washington will face great risks if it provokes Beijing over Taiwan. Meanwhile, the Taiwan administration should be aware that it cannot use the US warships in the Straits as tools against the mainland.

Yan Xuetong Photo: Li Hao/GT GT: The theme of the seventh World Peace Forum is ""constructing a security community: equality, equity and justice."" What does a security community imply? Yan: To understand security community, we should first know what a community is, then discuss the concept of security. A community refers to countries that become united to protect their shared interests. The European Community and the East African Community, for example, were founded because the members had common economic interests. Communities may be different in style and composition as countries may have common interests in economy, security or ideology and yet they must be based on shared interests. Objectively, countries that share common interests may have conflict of interest with other nations. As a result, many of our panels during the World Peace Forum are regional or even sub-regional ones. Likewise, it is more realistic to establish a regional or sub-regional community, as the countries are more likely to share common interests. I'm afraid that forming a global community is impossible now. No country is able to lead the world under the trend of bipolarity. Without a global leader, major regional countries will have to protect the security of their own regions and establish regional communities. It's hard to set up a sub-regional community, let alone a bigger one. For example, it would be impossible to build an East Asian Community or even Asian Community when simply building a Northeast Asian Community seems difficult. To build a community, countries should first seek common interests in a comparatively small area. Then we need to discuss the concept of security. Security means no threats, no fears, and no uncertainties. Thus a security community means countries that have common threats, common fears and common uncertainties. Without a global leader, uncertainty in the world has been increasing. For example, on July 4, people were still guessing whether China and the US will adopt their new tariff policies on July 6. People still expect US President Donald Trump to change his decision even though there are only two days left. At present, countries share common uncertainties in global trade. Besides, different regions have different fears. For example, surplus countries will have more fear and uncertainty than countries suffering trade deficits. Nations are also facing different threats. Middle Eastern countries, for instance, are facing the threat of war, while East Asian countries are not, especially when the tension over North Korean nuclear issue has been eased after the Singapore summit. Therefore, which countries could together build a security community depends on their common interests. GT: You have mentioned that the bipolarity structure may be finalized in five years, which attracted Western media attention. Since bipolarity between the US and the Soviet Union finally led to the latter's dissolution, will the structure bring more hazards to China? Yan: There are three types of configurations in the world: unipolarity, bipolarity and multipolarity. Which one is beneficial to China? It depends on China's actual strength. If China is an insignificant country under all of the three configurations, then none of them will have much influence on us. However, if we are the most powerful country, then unipolarity will be the most preferable. Besides, China being one of the bipolar powers is better than being one of the multipolar powers and even better than in a unipolar configuration dominated any other power. In my opinion, compared with the unipolarity led by the US, China will face fewer security hazards in being one of the bipolar countries. For example, the US won't attack Chinese embassy under the bipolarity structure, while it may be possible under unipolarity. If bipolarity between China and the US comes true, it at least shows that the two countries match each other in strength and China has the chance to rise to power. However, China will never rise under unipolarity led by the US. Bipolarity will actually benefit China. The Soviet Union's failure was mainly caused by its problematic domestic policies. It reminds China and the US that the one who adopts more successful domestic policies and who enhances its national power more rapidly will finally win the competition. What we can learn from the Cold War is that major countries change the world by changing themselves. The US changed the world by building its own power while the Soviet Union did it by its dissolution. Different from the bipolarity between the US and the Soviet Union, China and the US are facing off with globalization, in which the international environment has mingled with the domestic one. If China and the US want to benefit in the bipolarity structure, they need to adopt domestic and international policies in accordance with globalization. GT: You have said that China and the US should avoid ideological conflicts. The US is currently vigilant about China. What should China do to ease tension over ideology between the two countries? Yan: To avoid ideological conflicts, China should avoid adopting policies which may escalate the ideological disputes. To be specific, the dispute can be avoided when the US is promoting its ideology overseas while China is not. Besides, it is not Trump who wants to have ideological disputes with China, it is the judgment of some of his cabinet members. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis both advocate a competing model with China. Pompeo once talked about Africa: ""If we can put in place the building blocks, the ones we all know, right, the rule of law, property rights, sort of some of the central understandings of how economic growth take place, I am confident that the growth will occur with a model that looks more like the West's than China's."" Thus, the Chinese government should try to avoid ideological conflicts when President Trump hasn't decided to support his cabinet's opinion. At least we have the ability to prevent ideological dispute from being the main component of the two countries' strategic competition. However, if Beijing promotes the China model in the global society, we are not sure whether Trump will still oppose his cabinet. GT: The Trump government pursues the ""withdraw doctrine"" and unilateralism, which poses a challenge to world order. Western media believe that the power vacuum left by the US will create opportunities for China to lead the world. What is your take on this? Yan: In terms of strategic competition among major powers, when the strength of the dominant power declines and it is unable to provide leadership for the world or withdraws from some regions, there will be a power vacuum. The emerging powers should not blindly enter these regions. We need to ask why the US withdrew from these regions and why it does not want to provide leadership. The US is more powerful than China. If it fails to provide leadership in these regions, can countries with less strength have the ability to replace it? The reason the US withdraws from these regions is that it doesn't have enough strength to lead these regions anymore. When it is powerful, it can benefit from leading these regions. But if it continues to provide leadership while its power declines, it will only suffer losses. If the US is less powerful than China, China can consider providing leadership and gain from it. But the fact is that even the US, which is more powerful than the rising countries, cannot gain from its leadership. So China cannot make it. When China is not able to lead its neighboring countries, I don't think it can provide leadership to other regions, or its losses will outweigh its gains. Sometimes, China even lacks the strength to provide leadership in surrounding regions. For example, in Northeast Asia, Japan does not accept it; in South Asia, India does not accept it; in Central Asia, Russia holds reservations against it, although it still cooperates with China. If China is to lift its international standing, it should focus on how to strengthen its leadership in its neighborhood. Before this leadership is established, it should not provide any leadership to external regions. GT: You hold that the success of a rising power lies in that its political leadership is more powerful than the dominant power. How will you evaluate the political leadership of China and the US at the current stage? Yan: Judging from policies adopted by the two governments, uncertainty has become the feature of the US government. Since Trump took office, US soft power has seen an obvious decline and its leadership status is waning. This shows the leadership that Trump provides to the US is not effective. China has maintained its policies adopted by previous governments. China also faces a number of difficulties. Noticeably, it is hard for China to retain its economic growth at 7 percent. It indicates that China lacks strength to sustain rapid economic development. GT: The US has threatened a trade war against China and its main trading partners. How will this trade war evolve? Will it deal a heavy blow to the multilateral trade system? Yan: What Trump is doing is to change the current multilateral trading system. It was reported that the Trump administration has drafted legislation that would allow the US to abandon WTO rules. In other words, Trump aims to upend the current trading order rather than just challenge it. It is hard to predict how the trade war will evolve. It is possible that it will expand to the investment field, as the export of goods is directly linked with foreign investment and development of factories. I'm afraid I can't predict whether it will further expand to other fields. GT: You once said you disagreed with the view that there will be a war between China and the US. Do you still believe so? Yan: First of all, we need to define the time. I think during the Trump administration, or in five years' time, there will not be a direct war between the two. The crux is nuclear weapons. Neither China nor the US could bear the aftermath of a nuclear war. North Korea owns nuclear weapons, and the US dares not start a war against it. So there is little possibility that a war will break out between China and the US. The conflict between the two may take other forms, such as trade disputes or financial disputes. The war I mentioned is not the proxy war like the one that the US and Russia have in Syria. The proxy war was common during the Cold War era, while no actual war took place between the US and the Soviet Union. Currently, there is no menace of a direct war between China and the US. GT: In a previous interview with the Global Times, you held the possibility that conflicts involving the Korean Peninsula and the Taiwan Straits may erupt at the same time. Now that the North Korean nuclear crisis has somewhat eased, do you hold on to such views? Will the Taiwan row escalate during the Trump era? Yan: Now these conflicts have already been linked up. Trump first linked the issue of China-US trade deficit with the North Korean nuclear issue. After the nuclear issue has eased, he brought together trade deficit with the Taiwan issue. Now the Taiwan issue has exacerbated. The US has sent officials to Taiwan and spoke with Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen. The US congress also passed the Taiwan Travel Act. The State Department has reportedly requested that US Marines be sent to Taiwan to help safeguard American Institute in Taiwan, which is to restore military ties between the US and Taiwan. These problems went much further than I had expected and I believe things will get worse. In 2016, I predicted that Trump will support Taiwan independence forces. Now we can say that Trump is the American president who lends the most support to Taiwan separatists since the administration of Ronald Reagan. GT: After the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore, Trump mentioned that the US may withdraw its forces from South Korea. This is supposed to bring great changes to Northeast Asian security architecture. How do you see this possibility? Yan: I think it was just empty talk. It is very unlikely that US troops will be withdrawn from South Korea during Trump's tenure. "	7/5/18	0	0	-0.9956	-1
"Indian scholars wrong in equating territory row with Taiwan statusnOn April 25, the Civil Aviation Authority of China sent a letter to dozens of foreign airlines, requesting changes to the way they refer to Taiwan on their websites and in marketing literature within 30 days. As of May 25, many of these airlines had made corrections on their websites. Some others requested an extension until July 25, citing technical reasons. But airlines from countries like the US and Japan have either refused to correct their mistakes or made changes only on their Chinese websites. Air India is among the ones yet to change. Some Indian media outlets and scholars believe India has no reason to list Taiwan as part of China, unless China recognizes India's territorial claims. They argue that India's communiqués with China do not mention or support the one-China policy and Indian leaders did not speak explicitly about this policy; therefore, Indian companies do not have to abide by it. Should foreign companies, including the Indian ones, stick to the one-China principle? If foreign enterprises want to do business in China or their products are to enter the Chinese market, they must abide by Chinese laws. This works the same way in every country. As the Chinese mainland and Taiwan have been ruled apart for a long time, some foreign companies list Taiwan as a country on their websites, but they do not necessarily have the intention to support Taiwan independence. But if they refuse to make corrections when reminded, they are obviously supporting Taiwan independence and must face possible consequences or could even be thrown out of the Chinese market. In the past, China only required foreign governments to adhere to its one-China policy while non-governmental organizations were excluded from the requirement. But the Chinese government and society is now showing less and less tolerance toward activities that tend to split China and support Taiwan independence. They have asked non-governmental entities to stick to the policy. That Air India lists Taiwan as a country goes against India's official stance. Recognizing that there is only one China in the world, that the government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing all of China, and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory is the condition on which China establishes diplomatic ties with all countries. Before the beginning of this century, all governmental joint communiqués that China signed with other countries would admit Taiwan as part of China. The one-China principle has been widely accepted by the international community and since the new century, it doesn't have to be particularly articulated in joint communiqués not because China has given up the one-China policy, but because it is taken as understood. In recent years, the joint statements between China and India did not mention the one-China policy. Meetings between their leaders did not touch upon this issue either. But it does not mean the Indian government has abandoned this policy. As for the so-called one India policy, Indian Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj first communicated this to visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in 2014, but did not give any articulation to the policy. The Taiwan question is a matter of China's domestic affairs. This issue and bilateral territorial disputes are different. China respects India's territorial integrity. It did not support the separatist movement in Assam province, and hence India should not support the demand for Taiwan independence. As a state-owned company, Air India should abide by the country's political pledge. In the context of better Sino-Indian ties, New Delhi can act wiser on the Taiwan question.

"US makes risky military moves with TaiwannIllustration: Liu Rui/GT Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at Center for Strategic and International Studies, recently tweeted that ""Taiwan will join US navy drill in Solomon Islands as part of Pacific Partnership. Not the first time, but now being announced publicly."" The Taipei Times also reported that ""The US Navy has invited Taiwan to participate in the Pacific Partnership humanitarian relief training mission in the Solomon Islands in August."" The US honors the one-China policy. Therefore, when US administrative departments engaged in defense cooperation with Taiwan, they usually maintained a low profile, so as to avoid direct impact on Sino-US ties. But things are changing. Security collaboration between the US and Taiwan is increasing, and some of it has been made public. During former US president Barack Obama's term, some pro-Taiwan conservatives in the US were quite dissatisfied with Obama's Taiwan policy, criticizing the Democratic Party's self-imposed restrictions for drawing close to the one-China policy. They strongly demanded a redefinition of the US' own version of one-China policy. White House national security adviser John Bolton once published an article, ""Revisit the 'one-China Policy'"" in The Wall Street Journal. With intensifying strategic competition between Beijing and Washington, such US conservatives have become more vocal. In the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 2017, the US Congress approved a program of exchange of senior military officers and senior officials with Taiwan. The National Defense Authorization Act for 2018 even articulated that the Six Assurances and the Taiwan Relation Act are cornerstones of US-Taiwan ties. It also proposed to ""consider the advisability and feasibility of re-establishing port of call exchange between the United States navy and the Taiwan navy,"" and invited the military of Taiwan to participate in US exercises, such as the ""Red Flag"" exercise. The US Congress' version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 stated that US military forces may participate in Taiwan's annual Han Kuang military exercises and suggested: ""consider supporting the visit of a United States hospital ship to Taiwan."" These legislations show deepening US-Taiwan military ties. The administration of US President Donald Trump intends to strengthen defense ties with Taiwan. Trump focuses on the military factor in the contest among major powers. The conservatives around him have been calling to give more prominence to Taiwan in the US Indo-Pacific strategy. Over the past two years, Pentagon has continuously stressed US commitment to arms sales to Taiwan. Washington has also granted the marketing license for the sale of submarine technology to the island. ""For the first time in 16 years,"" the Taiwan-US Defense Business Forum was hosted in Taiwan in May, according to reports. All this points to deepening military cooperation between the US and Taiwan during Trump's tenure. To provoke Beijing, Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen is relying more on US security protection. After Trump put forward the Indo-Pacific strategy, the Tsai administration has sought to participate in it and play a special role in military and security affairs. So far, both the US and Taiwan have their reasons for developing military ties. The Trump administration is now taking the initiative and does not dare to break its promise of a one China policy. Yet in face of the enhancing military relations between the US and Taiwan, Beijing should be vigilant and warn them against brinksmanship. If the US and Taiwan insist on playing with fire, let them burn their hands.

"Netizens slam firm for inviting ex-drug user Taiwan celebnNetizens strongly criticized over the weekend a decision by skin care company NARS Cosmetics to invite a Taiwanese celebrity detained in Beijing in 2014 for taking drugs to a promotion, despite an apology. ""The NARS Chinese mainland team expresses regret over the invitation made by a NARS team from another region to a specific celebrity to a promotion,"" according to the company's statement published on Sunday on Sina Weibo. Kai Ko, a Taiwanese actor, posted photos during the NARS event in Taiwan on Sina Weibo Friday evening, which sparked heated online discussions. The hashtag ""Even a single eye shadow produced by NARS will become part of a drug dealers' gains"" was read over 75 million times and reposted 40,000 times. ""Celebrities who took drugs should be permanently banned,"" said a netizen on Sina Weibo, noting that many anti-drug enforcers risk their lives to protect people from drugs. ""I have removed all NARS products from my online shopping list, even if I was a NARS fan. Not anymore,"" said another Weibo user, who also uploaded a screenshot of her removing the products. NARS asked Ko to delete his social media posts on the event, Taiwan media United Daily News reported on Sunday. ""Celebrities like Kai Ko who have a history of taking drugs should not become a part of promotional activities. People will link drugs to the brand, thus damaging the brand's image,"" Zhu Wei, a professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times on Monday. ""Companies should not give celebrities who took drugs publicity… This will disturb the social order,"" said Zhu, adding that the celebrity's values should be more important than popularity. Beijing police detained Ko together with Jaycee Chan, Jackie Chan's son, in August 2014. Police found more than 100 grams of marijuana in Chan's residence, with Ko and Chan admitting to taking drugs.

"Mainland a hot destination for young Taiwan entrepreneursnA view of the façade of the Teapei Cheers tea drinks store in Xiamen, East China's Fujian Province Photo: Courtesy of Lin Zonglong A view of Yuanmeng Restaurant in Fuzhou, capital of East China's Fujian Province in June Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT For the increasing number of Taiwan youth who choose to come to the mainland to start businesses, there are many attractive factors, from the favorable business environment to the massive market and to the modern lifestyle on the mainland. That should explain why there are more and more Taiwan youth coming to the mainland, despite strained cross-Straits relations. Wu Jiaying, chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen's Association in Xiamen, East China's Fujian Province, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview that it is a ""strange phenomena"" that the more difficulties the Tsai Ing-wen administration poses to Taiwan youth when they come to the mainland to start up their businesses, the more they are attracted to the mainland. This trend has been particularly pronounced since the start of this year, he said. In the past, young people in Taiwan's south wanted to go to Taipei to fulfill their potential, but now they are saying, ""Let's go to Xiamen,"" Wu noted. Shi Yanling founded her business, the Yuanmeng Restaurant, in Three Lanes and Seven Alleys, a top tourist destination in Fuzhou, capital of Fujian, in October 2016. She told the Global Times in a recent interview that she started a business in the mainland because the market is highly integrated into the international market, compared with the island of Taiwan. ""If I could gain a foothold in the mainland, it means that I could easily succeed in other markets,"" said the 30-something woman, wearing a hair band decorated with a totem of her Atayal ethnic group. Shi, after investigating markets in Europe and the US, chose to open the restaurant in Fuzhou in October 2016. The restaurant offers dishes cooked with unique ingredients and spices from the Atayal people. It invites bands to play traditional Taiwan folk songs at night and sells handiwork that features Taiwan indigenous culture. Another attraction for Shi was the vast market. Shi took the example of asking for directions when she just came to the mainland two years ago. ""When I asked Fuzhou residents where the supermarket was, they told me to turn right and walk straight. I expected to arrive at the supermarket within three minutes, which is quite common in Taiwan, but it took me more than 30 minutes,"" Shi said with a laugh. Shi's business revenue has rapidly expanded in the past two years. ""We are now starting to make a profit,"" she said. For young entrepreneurs from Taiwan, the mainland provides great opportunities to help them realize their ambitions compared with the sluggish growth of Taiwan's economy. Lin Zonglong, owner of tea drinks store Teapei Cheers in Xiamen, Fujian, told the Global Times that huge business opportunities exist in the mainland's tea drinks market, although the competition is very fierce. Lin comes from Taipei and started up his first business in the mainland in 2016. Compared with Xiamen, where most tea drinks brands from Taiwan have established their chains, Lin, a post-80s man, bets on the potential of the mainland's western region such as Chengdu, capital of Southwest China's Sichuan Province, where purchasing power is on the rise. The Teapei Cheers store he recently started is still in the soft opening phase but Lin is confident about its future and plans to open three to five chain stores in Xiamen by the end of this year. There are many favorable policies for Taiwan's youth like Shi and Lin, who aspire to start a business on the mainland. More than that, the modern lifestyle is also appealing. Through four decades of reform and opening-up, the mainland has experienced dramatic changes not only in fortune but also in cultural taste and its way of life. Lin noted that life in the mainland is now more advanced than in Taiwan in some ways, a reversal from 40 years ago when China first embarked on the path of reform and opening-up. ""Back in Taipei, I cannot order food through apps using my mobile phone, which is quite convenient in Xiamen. Plus, I have to take cash or credit cards when going out since there is no digital wallet in Taiwan… I have got used to the developed online life here,"" Lin noted. "	6/27/18	0	0	0.998	1
"Taiwan businessmen witness mainland's evolving business environment over 40 years of reform and opening-upnAn overview of Pingtan county in East China's Fujian Province, the nearest place in the Chinese mainland to Taiwan. Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT Editor's Note: Fujian, the nearest province in the Chinese mainland to the island of Taiwan, has witnessed a growth in the number of Taiwan businessmen from a handful to tens of thousands during China's 40 years of reform and opening-up. Those Taiwan entrepreneurs have become a driving force in Fujian's economic takeoff, bringing capital, technology and management experience to the local economy. Global Times reporters recently paid a visit to the province and talked with several businessmen who invested since the late 1980s as well as some Taiwan youths who started up businesses in recent years. They shared their experiences of starting up businesses in the mainland. Chen Xiurong, a 50-something Taiwan businesswoman who came to East China's Fujian Province in the late 1990s, has experienced a dramatic shift in the market environment over the years, from needing to pay to take an elevator in a department store to ordering everything through the click of a mobile phone. Chen is among the first Taiwan entrepreneurs who came to the mainland for businesses and witnessed the massive changes Fujian has undergone over the past few decades since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policies. ""When I first came to the mainland with my father in 1987, all the department stores in Fuzhou [capital of East China's Fujian Province] were State-run, with a limited and outdated selection of goods. Consumers even needed to pay for taking elevators at the store,"" Chen Xiurong, the founder of Yuan Ju Real Estate Development Co, told the Global Times. Spotting huge opportunities stemming from local residents' rising purchasing power, Chen's father, a well-known Taiwan entrepreneur who is of Fujian origin, opened one of the first high-end commercial department stores, Xianshi, in Fuzhou in 1989, selling clothes, cosmetics and imported goods. The department store was a huge success. Locals walked into the store out of curiosity and were dazzled by designs they had never seen before. ""All Fujian residents knew that if you wanted to buy the best products, you should come to Xianshi,"" she recalled. Similar to Chen's experience, Tianfu Holding Company, a Xiamen-headquartered tea producer and supplier founded by Taiwan businessman Rie-Ho Lee, who is also of Fujian origin, is another example of how the Taiwan investors shared the benefits of the mainland's reform and opening-up. Lee opened his first tea-producing factory in Zhangzhou, Fujian, in 1993, his first business in the mainland. Since then, Lee's business has enjoyed robust growth. ""At that time, we did not have any competitors at all. Opening one store could bring a huge amount of profit, and we were making money like riding on a rocket,"" recalled Lee, who is now in his 70s. He added that the labor cost and housing rental fees at that time were inexpensive. ""Hiring a beautiful waitress only took about 300 yuan ($45.51) a month, compared with a monthly salary of 9,000 yuan in the island of Taiwan,"" Lee told the Global Times over the weekend. A view of Xianshi Department Store in 1990s Photo: Courtesy of Chen Xiurong A view of Xianshi Department Store in June Photo: Courtesy of Chen Xiurong Evolving environment Recalling her experience in the 1990s, Chen, who was called by her father to take over the department store's management, said in a straightforward manner that she was reluctant to come to the mainland because there were huge gaps of at least several decades between the living standard of Taiwan and the mainland. The business environment was also unfriendly to Taiwan businessmen in the 1990s, Chen added. People from Taiwan like Chen had to ""find connections"" in the local government so that their application could be approved and processed swiftly. Lee also complained about restrictions on the areas of investment applied to Taiwan businesspeople in the 1990s. ""Taiwan regulators did not allow me to make a direct investment in the mainland and I bypassed them, applying through my company in the US. However, I became more frustrated when I learned that my company in the mainland could not directly export tea to foreign markets under relevant rules. I had to find a mainland tea agency,"" Lee said. ""I felt abandoned because both sides did not love me."" However, after 40 years of reform and opening-up, the business environment for Taiwan entrepreneurs is better and changing a lot. For example, Lee's company was allowed in the 2000s to ship tea directly overseas. And now, Lee is planning to open 500 stores in countries and regions that benefit from the Belt and Road initiative. In February, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council announced 31 measures aiming to provide better opportunities for Taiwan businesses in the mainland. Under the new rule, Taiwan companies are placed on a level playing field with mainland peers, eligible for ""Made in China 2025"" manufacturing and infrastructure development contracts. Speaking of the evolving business environment, Chen also took note of a standardized and transparent application procedure nowadays in the mainland. Wu Jiaying, chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen's Association in Xiamen, who came to Xiamen in 1996 to start his business, told the Global Times that ""local governments' working efficiency has been obviously enhanced, which reassures Taiwan investors that they should stay and continue their business here."" New concerns However, since Tsai Ing-wen, the current Taiwan leader, came into office in 2016, cross-Straits relations have deteriorated. This in turn has threatened Taiwan enterprises' businesses in the Chinese mainland. For example, as the number of tourists from Taiwan slid due to strained cross-Straits relations, Tianfu's tea products also experienced a mild drop in sales in the mainland, according to Lee. ""Taiwan entrepreneurs in Xiamen have encountered more inconvenience due to the suspended cross-Straits exchange mechanism,"" Wu noted. ""For example, in the past, we could reimburse medical fees directly back to Taiwan if we received treatment in Xiamen, but now we're afraid of being sick because the Taiwan administration is purposely making it much harder,"" said Wu. A Taiwan businessman told the Global Times on condition of anonymity that currently, the raw material from Taiwan for the firm's products has faced stricter customs checks, resulting in delayed delivery and higher expenses. Wu also noted that Taiwan businesses are now faced with many more rivals in Fujian with pressure not only from growing local enterprises and foreign-funded firms, but also homogenous competition from themselves. Lee also admitted that the growth of Tianfu's revenue is slowing amid intense competition. Besides, Taiwan enterprises in traditional industries such as shoes and clothing are now faced with a transformation to advanced manufacturing, as the mainland's economy pursues high-quality development and labor costs rise substantially. For example, the locations where these Taiwan investors initially established their plants have now become urban centers. As such, the plants need to improve their production processes to meet environmental requirements, Wu explained, noting the trend is that more Taiwan firms with outdated capacity and requiring intensive labor are moving out of Xiamen to Southeast Asia and Africa. ""Meanwhile, more high-tech Taiwan firms, such as the ones in the biotech and integrated circuit sectors, as well as high-level services, are seeking a foothold in the mainland,"" he added.

"PLA conducts island encirclement exercise around TaiwannMilitary actions, including those involving aircraft carriers, are always an option if the island of Taiwan continues to ""play with fire,"" an expert warned Tuesday after the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy conducted real combat exercises around the island involving ""Chinese Aegis"" class destroyers. A fleet consisting of destroyer Jinan and frigate Huanggang under the PLA Eastern Theater Command has been conducting a high-sea real combat exercise since June 17, the official website of the PLA Navy, navy.81.cn, reported on Monday. The fleet has sailed through straits and waterways including the Bashi Channel and the Taiwan Straits, according to the report. The exercise has successfully examined tactics and training procedures by teaming up with other naval warships, aviation forces and coastal defense forces in multiple sea areas, it said. The PLA Navy and Air Force are increasing the frequency of military exercises around Taiwan, Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The fleet had entered Taiwan's ""air defense identification zone"" and stayed for more than a week. This is the PLA Navy's second island encirclement exercise around the island within a month, Taiwan-based media United Daily News reported last week. ""It is normal and legitimate for the Chinese mainland to send strong signals like this to the administration of the island,"" said Song. PLA must be able to deal with not only Taiwan's military, but also potential intervention from the military alliance of the US and Japan, Song stressed. This is also the first time a Type 052C destroyer, namely Jinan, has conducted a training mission like this. Type 052C is called the ""Chinese Aegis"" because of its phased array radar and air defense missiles, which pose huge threats to Taiwan, noted United Daily News. However, Type 052C is no more than an air defense missile destroyer. Taiwan should expect more military equipment including China's 10,000-ton class missile destroyer Type 055 and aircraft carriers to take part in similar exercises in the future, said Song. Solving the Taiwan question with force is always a choice on the table, and Taiwan should not play with fire, warned Song. "	6/26/18	0	0	-0.8658	-1
"Behind Taiwan leader’s ravings is panicnBehind Taiwan leader’s ravings is panic Taiwan's leader Tsai Ing-wen called on the international community to ""constrain China"" and ""minimize the expansion of their [China's] hegemonic influence"" in an interview with AFP on Monday. ""There are times when we feel frustrated, but the Taiwanese people do not have the option of giving up,"" Tsai told the AFP. Tsai accused the Chinese mainland of ""expansion,"" adding that such an expansion ""is not just Taiwan's challenge. It is a challenge for the region and the world as a whole."" Tsai repeated her wish to meet the mainland's leader on an equal footing and with no political pre-conditions. This is one of Tsai's fiercest attacks against the mainland since she came into office. Different from the past, Tsai described cross-Straits affairs as the mainland's confrontation against the democratic world, urged the West to jointly contain the mainland and openly sold Taiwan as leverage for exterior forces to intervene in China's domestic issues. Tsai has maintained her political hypocrisy. She refused to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus, and as a result, all official communication across the Straits halted. Yet, Tsai talked glibly about her wish for a meeting with the mainland's leader, which is impossible. Tsai is not accepted by any influential international organization and thus is happy to talk to Western media. But this time Tsai has gone too far. This highlights that the Tsai administration panics following a series of failures. It has no choice but resorting to such provocative remarks to motivate pro-independence forces and win sympathy from the international community. The mainland's criticism on the Taiwan administration is made on a case-by-case basis. The central government has been trying to avoid generalizing over the Tsai administration, as it wants to leave room for the cross-Straits relationship to not devolve into a showdown. But Tsai labeled the mainland's justified actions as ""expansion"" and maliciously accused the mainland of challenging the world. Tsai is taking a dangerous step forward from her previous commitment to maintaining the status quo. In fact, Tsai has no bargaining chip in hand. Compared with the mainland, Taiwan's economic scale carries little weight to the world. It is an irreversible trend that the island, pitting itself against the mainland, will be abandoned by the world. Washington is merely using Taiwan as a chess piece in its politics with the mainland. Taiwan can only obtain uncertainty, rather than a sense of security, from Washington. Tsai's team may become more provocative and radical in speech so as to balance its frustrations. Votes are the only pursuit of this obstinate and fragile team. The Taiwan administration has pinned all its hopes on the international community, or more precisely, the US. Washington is using Taiwan as a cheap pawn. Tsai is fully aware of the risks of being used by Washington, but has no alternative choice. Tsai and radical pro-independence forces should consider the consequences before acting so arrogantly and frantically. "	6/26/18	0	0	-0.9743	-1
"US Defense Secretary’s visit likely to focus on Korea, Taiwan, S.China SeanUS Secretary of Defense James Mattis' visit to China this week is an attempt to rebuild communication channels between the two countries' militaries and an opportunity to discuss future security arrangements on the Korean Peninsula , while navigating around rocky bilateral ties caused by South China Sea and Taiwan questions, analysts said on Monday.At the invitation of Chinese State Councilor and Defense Minister General Wei Fenghe, Mattis will visit China from Tuesday to Thursday, Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang, spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense , said on Monday.Chinese State and military leaders will meet with Mattis and the two sides will exchange views on the two countries' relations, their militaries and other issues of common concern, Ren said.This will be the first visit of a US Secretary of Defense to China since 2014, the official website of US Department of Defense said.Wang Yunfei, a Beijing-based military expert and a retired officer of the Chinese navy, told the Global Times on Monday that ""Mattis' visit comes at a time when China-US security ties are facing problems.""Wang said that many military communication channels between the two countries have been suspended since the US withdrew its invitation to China to attend a US-hosted naval drill, and launched a series of provocations on China's legitimate activities in the South China Sea.The Pentagon disinvited China from participating in the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC) on May 23, in response to the alleged ""militarization of islands in the South China Sea,"" Reuters reported.The Chinese Ministry of National Defense said at the time that the US' move would close the door on promoting mutual trust and cooperation.RIMPAC is billed as the world's largest international maritime exercise and is held every two years in waters near Hawaii in June and July.China participated in the previous two RIMPAC exercises in 2014 and 2016.""The People's Liberation Army and the US armed forces had intended to establish hotlines between theater commands and combat units, but the process was suspended after the US rescinded its invitation to RIMPAC. Mattis may seek to rebuild these channels with China during his visit,"" Wang noted.China and the US need to maintain effective military communications to reduce friction and miscalculations, and to prevent damaging regional stability and world peace, Wang said.""Mattis may also express US concerns on South China Sea issues and might ask China to reduce or slow island constructions in the region. But the South China Sea is China's territory and the US must stop its provocations,"" Wang remarked.Mattis criticized China on South China Sea issues when he attended the Shangri-La dialogue held in Singapore on June 2, Reuters reported.The Taiwan question may also be a key topic for Mattis, especially after the US Congress passed the ""National Defense Authorization Act,"" which authorized the US to conduct high-level personnel exchanges with Taiwan and to potentially send its warships to visit the island, Wang said.China is not the only destination ofMattis' Asia trip. After his visit to China, he will travel to Seoul, South Korea. He will conclude his trip Friday in Tokyo, Japan, said the US Department of Defense.""The Korean Peninsula will also be a key issue during Mattis' trip. After the summit in Singapore, the US and North Korea are moving toward détente after the US agreed to stop its war games with South Korea. Future regional security arrangements will be extremely crucial,"" said Diao Daming, an American studies expert and an associate professor at the Renmin University of China,.Although China and the US have differences on many issues, the peninsula is the key issue that requires both countries' cooperation, Diao said.""Stopping military exercises is just a first step. With détente between the US and North Korea, the US might need to make additional moves to realize its 'security assurance' promise to Pyongyang. The US has to talk with China, because it knows China cannot be excluded,"" Wang noted.""China might raise the withdraw of the THAAD [Terminal High Altitude Area Defense] system from South Korea, and the US might ask China to reduce or cancel its military reconnaissance of the US and South Korea,"" Wang said.

"China imposes anti-dumping measures on styrene imported from three sourcesnChina's Ministry of Commerce will impose anti-dumping measures on imported styrene from three sources including the US, South Korea and the Taiwan region, starting from Saturday.According to the ministry's statement published on Friday, the anti-dumping duties are levied at rates ranging from 3.8 to 55.7 percent for a period of five years.The ministry launched an investigation into the case back in June 2017 after receiving complaints from the styrene industry on the Chinese mainland.Styrene is widely used to make polystyrene, which in turn is used to make plastics and foam containers.

"PLA conducts anti-underwater mine warfare drill to protect maritime sovereigntynThe Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy recently conducted its first competitive live-munition underwater anti-mine warfare exercise, with experts saying the training focused on future military scenarios. Bombers, minesweepers and mine-hunting ships of multiple PLA theater commands participated in ""back-to-back"" tests in the East China Sea, which included covert installation of underwater mines by air units, navigational path clearance by surface ships, and mine detection and sweeping, the official website of the PLA Navy, navy.81.cn reported Friday. Installation and clearance of underwater mines is an important naval battle capability that must be improved upon in preparation for possible future foreign interference in the Taiwan Straits, the South China Sea or the East China Sea, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Monday. Some military powers could block China's key marine outfalls and navigation paths by installing mines to delay the PLA, Song added, noting that PLA Navy preventative strategy could help defuse such foreign threats. PLA deterrence strategy of laying underwater mines could also effectively keep foreign forces away from China's coastal waters, he said. Nearly 20 underwater mines were installed, detected and swept during the assessment. ""The simulation was very realistic because we didn't have any information about the mines related to quantity, model or location,"" Zhu Shizhai, commander of a Southern Theater Command anti-mine fleet, was quoted by the report as saying. Zhu's fleet was the first to find and eliminate a navigational path mine in the assessment on June 12. PLA officials simulated complex scenarios according to real battlefield rules and did everything possible to recreate realistic combat situations in order to reinforce troops' strengths and improve upon their weaknesses. Mine clearance is a challenge not only for China, but also for militarily advanced countries such as the US and Japan, he said, adding that reinforcement of the capability better prepares militaries for future operations. More than 40 experts and professors from PLA Navy training institutions and research institutes and colleges were allocated to different fleets to comprehensively evaluate ships' mine-sweeping operations based on tactical methods, maneuvering process, and combat effectiveness.

"If the US stops war games on peninsula, what’s next?nAfter the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on June 12, US President Donald Trump told the media that joint military drills with South Korea will be suspended, as the Pentagon on Monday formally suspended a major military exercise planned for August with South Korea. This can be regarded as a response to North Korea's recent moves toward denuclearization. Besides the pledge to stop the military drills, he also suggested the possibility of reducing the number of US forces in the future. To quote Trump, ""So, number one, we save money, a lot. And number two it really is something that I think they very much appreciated."" From North Korea's perspective, the suspension or even termination of US-South Korea joint military drills is an honest effort to help realize denuclearization, namely a security assurance for the North Korean regime from the US. It is a necessary move to implement the first article of the Singapore joint statement - ""to establish new US-DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity."" Meanwhile, if the purpose of the drills is to protect South Korea and deter a North Korean security threat, suspension of the drills suggests that the US and North Korea are ready to replace confrontational antagonism with peaceful negotiations. As for reducing US forces in South Korea, it really depends on North Korea's substantive actions toward denuclearization. Trump has made it clear, ""I'd like to be able to bring them back home. But that's not part of the equation right now."" His words suggest that what North Korea has done is still far from being enough for the US to consider reducing its military presence. In the long term, although a key ally to the US, South Korea has its own ambitions for political and military self-dependence. Since its commencement, the US-South Korea alliance has been rather one-sided, with the US playing a disproportionately dominant role. Victor Cha, former director for Asian affairs in the White House's National Security Council, describes US implementation of alliance relations in East Asia after World War II as a ""powerplay."" However difficult it is, unification on the Korean Peninsula has always remained an inevitable mandate in the eyes of politicians in the two Koreas. Hence if the threat from North Korea minimizes in the future, the US-South Korea alliance will probably become a symbolic stronghold of US leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. Meanwhile, as South Korea has always dreamed of a more reliable self-dependence, a possible ideal scenario is as follows: parts of the US-South Korea alliance may be delegated to the US-Japan alliance to give the two Koreas a little more space to become acquainted. In the meantime, all changes related to the US-South Korea alliance have far-reaching significance, and other parties in the region, including China, are involved in one way or another. There are at least four major problematic issues in current Sino-US relations: trade disputes, the Korean Peninsula, the South China Sea and Taiwan. Regarding Trump's all-direction trade war strategy, China may implement retaliatory measures. The Korean Peninsula issue is ostensibly a US-North Korea conflict which involves several other parties, and a new conflict resolution mechanism is on its way, despite endless back and forth in the past. Once the Korean Peninsula stabilizes, the South China Sea and the Taiwan question are the other two flashpoints. However, since China may find some practical and appropriate approach to build at least a minimum level of trust with other claimants in the South China Sea, the Taiwan question may turn to be more critical to China's core interests. Should the Korean Peninsula see a new era for peace and reconciliation, China needs to pay greater attention to interactions between Taiwan and the US. In sum, although suspension of US-South Korea joint military drills is under discussion, reducing US forces or withdrawing them entirely remains rather unrealistic. For China, one critical question however emerges: once the ""war games"" on the Korean Peninsula eventually cease, will it vanish, or might it go somewhere else?

"Mainland offers 600 internships for young Taiwanese: spokespersonnMainland offers 600 internships for young Taiwanese: spokesperson The Chinese mainland will provide around 600 internships in various industries for young Taiwanese in the coming months, a spokesperson in Beijing said Wednesday. ""Many government offices and enterprises across the country have introduced their summer internship programs for Taiwanese youth,"" said Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson with the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, at a press conference. Ma also pointed out that in east China's Shanghai City and Fujian Province, local governments had each issued over 50 preferential policies covering sectors including education, employment, job security, and medical services, for Taiwanese living in those regions. ""Taiwanese need only to pass the law and regulation exams to be securities, futures, or fund practitioners if they had already obtained qualifications in Taiwan,"" said Ma. Taiwanese companies will also enjoy preferential policies including market access, financial services, fund support and customs clearance, he added. "	6/13/18	0	0	0.8591	1
"US more provocative on Taiwan questionnUS more provocative on Taiwan question The new American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) compound is slated for opening on June 12. There was speculation within Taiwan that American President Donald Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton, or officials of the same level, may attend the unveiling ceremony, but the US State Department announced on Sunday that an assistant secretary of state will be dispatched to visit Taipei and attend the ceremony. Assistant secretary of state is the highest level American official to visit Taiwan since the US severed diplomatic ties with the island. Earlier reports that the US Marine Corps would be posted at the new AIT facility and oversee its security have since been disproven. Many US embassies and consulates are guarded by the marine corps. Although the AIT fulfills certain state functions of embassies and consulates such as issuing US visas, nominally, it is a non-profit private organization. A larger AIT compound indicates Washington will increase the number of personnel stationed in Taiwan and the Taiwan card will carry more weight in US strategy toward China. Washington will become more active in provoking China over the Taiwan question. The Congress has passed the Taiwan Travel Act and the National Defense Authorization Act is getting more aggressive regarding the Taiwan question. Will higher level American officials visit AIT at its official launch? This could be used as a bargaining chip of Washington against China. Beijing must stop Washington's salami-slicing tactic toward Taiwan but this cannot be achieved through trading interests. As friction over the Taiwan question may escalate, we must make corresponding contingency plans and strive for taking the initiative. First, we can't be led by the nose by the US. We must build leverage to deal with the US and Taiwan, let both parties know they will pay the price no matter what provocations they make. We must draw a red line for the US and Taiwan. Once crossed, a serious Taiwan Straits crisis will be triggered. For instance, visits by US warships to Taiwan or direct participation of American troops in Taiwan defense will disrupt the entire cross-Straits situation. The US State Department viewed the AIT building dedication in Taipei as ""a milestone"" in US-Taiwan relations. Similarly, Taiwanese authorities have attached unprecedented importance to the matter. The reason why Washington is further activating Taiwan as a chess piece and Taiwan is desperately clinging to the US is because they found it more difficult to deal with the mainland. The mainland must continue to build up its deterrence against Taiwanese authorities, making them know that the US cannot be their savior. A closer relationship with the US is not better for Taiwan. There are also risks for the US to play the Taiwan card. The US and Taiwan need to realize this. "	6/11/18	1	0	-0.549	-1
"China should prepare for cross-Straits crisisnChina should prepare for cross-Straits crisis The US Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday published an amended version of the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act which contains provisions calling for strengthened security cooperation and military communication with Taiwan including supporting US troops to participate in the island's Han Kuang exercises. The legislation will very likely pass the Senate. The 2018 National Defense Authorization Act garnered extensive attention as it demanded the US defense secretary evaluate the possibility of mutual visits by naval vessels between the US and Taiwan. Congress also passed the Taiwan Travel Act, which allows high-level visits between leaders of Taiwan and the US. These laws encroach on the one-China principle, which is the political foundation of China-US relations, and create uncertainties in bilateral relations. With growing vigilance and simmering bellicosity toward China, the US elites are viewing China increasingly negatively. The provocative legislation reflects this change. In addition to trade tensions, the US has taken an aggressive stance against China on security issues, which made it more challenging for Beijing to handle friction with Washington. On the one hand, the US has increased provocations against China's core interests with an aim of pressuring and deterring China. On the other, it has moved incrementally, trying to avoid a backlash and a dangerous showdown. The Trump administration has launched a strategic offensive against China and taken a tough stance. But it doesn't want a strategic showdown regardless of the costs and results. China must keep calm in the face of an unscrupulous US strategic squeeze. We must figure out the strategic position of China and the US, keeping in mind the US advantage while having confidence in our own strength. Based on this, we must further clarify and reiterate China's core interests to the outside world. The core interests combined together constitute the lifeline of China's rise. China must safeguard that lifeline by all means. The Taiwan Straits is China's core interest. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations with Beijing, Washington has by and large abided by the principles enshrined in the three communiqués. However, the phone call between Donald Trump and Tsai Ing-wen when he was president-elect derailed that protocol in bilateral relations. Afterward, the US Congress passed a series of Taiwan-related acts. Washington seems to be playing an active role in sabotaging cross-Straits stability. China and the US are likely to face a new Taiwan Straits crisis sooner or later. China needs to make early preparations. The Chinese mainland is not afraid of any crisis in the Taiwan Straits, even a showdown, so as to quash US and Taiwan aggressiveness and safeguard national unity. Concessions won't win long-term peace and cooperation between China and the US. Only if both countries act in accordance with principles and do not cross each other's bottom line can bilateral relations be stabilized. "	6/7/18	0	0	0.7738	1
"US sending warship through Taiwan Straits may provoke Chinese mainland responsenThe US sending a warship through the Taiwan Straits will do nothing to improve Taiwan's declining situation and may provoke more actions from Beijing, said Chinese mainland observers.The US should prudently handle the Taiwan question so as to avoid harming bilateral ties and peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits region, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Tuesday.""The Taiwan question is the most important and sensitive core issue in the China-US relations,"" Hua said.Her remarks came after Reuters reported that the US was considering sending a warship through the Taiwan Straits.The US already examined plans for passage of an aircraft carrier but did not pursue them, presumably out of concern about upsetting China, Reuters quoted a US official as saying.The last time a US aircraft carrier transited the Taiwan Straits was in 2007.""The US feels the urge to give Taiwan a hand right now, when the region is facing mounting pressure from Beijing and more countries are cutting their 'diplomatic relations with Taiwan,'"" Wu Xinbo, director of Fudan University's Center for American Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Burkina Faso on May 24 declared it would break off ""diplomatic relations"" with Taiwan, the second country to do so within a month.But the US action will do little to help Taiwan, as the island is just a card for them to intimidate China, Wu said, warning that it may invite responses from Beijing.""The Taiwan question is the bottom line that cannot be touched or challenged,"" said Lieutenant-General He Lei, deputy head of the Academy of Military Sciences of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) at this year's Shangri-La Dialogue , in response to remarks by US Defense Secretary James Mattis.He stressed ""the PLA has the determination, confidence and capability to safeguard China's sovereignty, unity and developmental interests.""The defense ministry warned in November that it would hold frequent military exercises in the area including flying aircraft around the island and sending its carrier through the Straits.Taiwan's pro-independence power has no choice but to seek help from the US, Japan or even India, Wu Yaming, a Beijing-based expert on cross-Straits relations, told the Global Times.He noted the US and China should end the growing antagonism over the Taiwan question as Taiwan will be reunified sooner or later and it's not for the US to decide.

"US warships unwelcome in Taiwan StraitsnAccording to Western media, the US is considering sending a warship through the Taiwan Straits. If true, that means Washington is ready to pile more pressure on China. On the same day the news came out, two US B-52 bombers reportedly took off from Guam and flew to the vicinity of China's Nansha Islands. Later, a spokesperson for the US Pacific Air Forces denied it.The US military has not formally confirmed that it would send a warship through the Taiwan Straits. Yet these messages, real or not, constitute psychological warfare against China. Putting pressure on China from all directions has lately become the general US attitude toward Beijing.Some people from Washington believe that it is easy for the US to make trouble for China: They think the cost is very low or even nothing. They imagine they can gain Chinese cooperation and obedience to US interests this way.Beijing is indeed unwilling to see a dispute with Washington. Instead it wants to maintain collaboration with the US in as many areas as possible. However, the Chinese people are well aware that making concessions in the face of unreasonable pressure will only lead to passivity. Hence countering provocation is our basic rationale and principle.The Taiwan Straits is an international waterway. But US warships going through that water has special geopolitical implications with regard the Taiwan question. The Straits is close to the Chinese mainland and also a landmark region for China's core interests. Beijing nowadays has more resources and leverage to engage in a game with Washington.The US has never frightened any small country so far. How could it possibly scare a major power like China? Be it the Taiwan Straits or the South China Sea, the actual effect of provocation by the US will only be to boost Beijing vigilance.When there is vigilance, there will be actions. The discomfort those actions bring to the US will generally equal the discomfort Washington brings to Beijing.From time to time, elites from Washington threaten to be tougher on China. The Chinese side has responded with a low-key attitude and avoided proactively escalating friction between the two. But if the US takes practical actions, it will be another story. Beijing will not yield to Washington's real provocations.The US military better not get too close to the Taiwan Straits or stir up trouble there. Military confrontation has not yet formed in the Taiwan Straits and it is hoped that day will never come.But once the worst case scenario occurs, China is prepared to safeguard its national sovereignty and dignity at any cost. By then, China will be difficult to deal with and the US will find that military confrontation against Beijing in the Taiwan Straits is too heavy a burden to bear.If Washington's real intention is to create tension in Sino-US ties and it is willing to pay any price for it, there will be another story between China and the US as well as in the Asia-Pacific region.

"Taiwan military exercise ‘a waste of effort’: expertnTaiwan is conducting its latest Han Kuang live-fire military exercise, which Chinese mainland experts said on Monday was a waste of effort. The live-fire drills last from Monday to Friday and focus on joint air-sea combat operations, anti-landing operations and joint anti-airborne combat operations, with drones operated by civilian companies joining in surveillance missions, the Taipei Times newspaper reported Monday. Taiwan's ""defense ministry"" said that the exercise is based on the cross-Straits military situation rather than a scripted future scenario as in previous years. The purpose of the drills is to master asymmetric warfare, when the military power of participants differs significantly, the Taipei-based news website chinatimes.com reported on April 24. This year's exercise takes aim at the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to such an extent that will only make the cross-Straits relationship deteriorate further, Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times. ""No matter how hard Taiwan's army tries, their effort will only be wasted if they stand against the PLA,"" said Song, citing the strong military power of the PLA in comparison with Taiwan's. The PLA Air Force's H-6K strategic bomber conducted a nighttime island encirclement patrol around Taiwan island on May 25. ""The patrol aimed at improving China's ability to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity, with similar training planned in the future,"" defense ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said at a routine press conference on Thursday when asked whether the island encirclement patrol was directed against the Han Kuang military exercise. Taiwan should give up on its fantasy that the US or Japan will come to its aid. They must turn back to the right track of firmly adhering to the 1992 Consensus and the one-China policy, as ""Taiwan independence"" is a road with no return, Song warned. ""Taiwan independence"" has not won much support within Taiwan either, Song said. ""Should a military conflict break out with the PLA, Taiwan's soldiers might question who they should fight for… Therefore it is important for the PLA to pose military deterrence to the Taiwan authorities as much as possible."" Remains of a Taiwan F-16 fighter jet were found on Monday afternoon after it went missing earlier that day during routine training. The pilot remained missing as of press time, chinatimes.com reported. "	6/4/18	0	0	-0.9447	-1
"Taiwan youths flock to mainland for education, employment opportunitiesnStudents from the mainland and Taiwan play games at a youth festival in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, on August 10, 2017. Photo: VCG Lucius Huang, an 18-year-old high -school graduate from Taiwan, had an unconditional offer from the top university on the island, but when he received an offer from Tsinghua University on the Chinese mainland on May 5, he jumped with excitement. ""I was too excited to speak. That was probably the most exciting moment of my life,"" Huang said. National Taiwan University (NTU) in Taipei is the best varsity on the island - a dream of most students there. Beijing-based Tsinghua University (THU) is one of the best in the country. According to the QS top universities ranking in 2018, THU ranked 25th in the world while NTU was placed 76. Tsinghua's entry score for Taiwan students is 73 this year, and Huang is just stepping on the line. The full marks for Taiwan's General Scholastic Ability Test (GSAT), a university entrance exam in Taiwan, is 75. ""The entry score set by Tsinghua this year is the highest ever, and has been caused by the rapidly rising number of applicants from Taiwan, which means the competition among them is getting extremely tough,"" Huang said. Go to the mainland ""Come to NTU, go to the US"" used to be a proverb in Taiwan since the 1970s. Now it has changed to ""Come to PKU (Peking University in Beijing, another top university of China), go to the mainland,"" said a student from Taiwan surnamed Li, 19, who was enrolled by PKU in 2017. High-school graduates from Taiwan are not just targeting the top universities on the mainland, such as Tsinghua and Peking University, some relatively less prominent universities are also popular. Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province is an example. According to the data provided by Sun Yat-sen University, there are almost 600 applications from Taiwan's high-school graduates this year - a four-fold rise over the last year. The university shortlisted 200 applicants for interview, China Central Television reported on May 20. ""When I was in primary school and junior high-school, there were not so many people coming to the mainland for higher education, but after I entered high school, there was a spurt in students around me with plans to go to universities on the mainland,"" said Ivan Lin, 19, another student admitted to Tsinghua University. Lin was selected for admission to NTU but he decided to join Tsinghua. Huang echoes what Lin said: ""Except Tsinghua and PKU, many classmates also applied for other universities on the mainland such as Wuhan University and Chongqing University."" Voting with feet After the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) became the ruling party of the island in 2016, cross-Straits relations have been volatile since DPP refuses to recognize the 1992 Consensus, which embodies the one-China principle. It also pushes for ""desinicization."" However, the DPP's policy on the island is not working well. The DPP cannot stop the youth of Taiwan to ""vote with feet,"" said Zheng Boyu, 31, from Taiwan and based in Beijing - the manager of Vstartup Station of Taiwan, an institution helping Taiwanese youth apply to Chinese mainland universities, obtain internship opportunities in companies or start up their own business on the mainland. The income of Taiwan's residents has been stagnant for about 16 years, while on the other hand, the mainland is developing at a remarkable pace, Zheng said. According to latest data about income of Chinese university graduates, if Taiwan students come to study in mainland universities which rank above 106 and work on the mainland after graduating, their income will definitely be higher than Taiwan's average, and this is why applicants from Taiwan are increasing in recent years,"" said Yu Qiang, an associate professor on Taiwan studies at the University of International Relations. Lower the cost of integration ""The mainland will create a better environment and more opportunities for Taiwan students to study, undertake internships, obtain employment or start up business here,"" said An Fengshan, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, at a press conference. ""It's a natural choice and an irresistible trend for Taiwan students to apply to mainland colleges,"" An said, noting that Taiwan students were going after better chances to realize their dreams, and their parents also want them to have better educational opportunities, Xinhua reported. Lin, the student from Taiwan admitted to Tsinghua, said, ""For my generation in Taiwan, we are very likely to work on the mainland, so if we can come here early, we can start to build the connections with people earlier, and adapt to the mainland's speed, environment, rules and situation as soon as possible."" ""The mainland and Taiwan should both work toward lowering the cost of integration for the next generation. Education and employment are the best options, and with time, quantitative changes will lead to qualitative ones, bringing improvement to Cross-Straits relations,"" Zheng said. "	6/4/18	0	0	0.9989	1

"As Taiwan loses allies, we must be wary of desperate movesnIn the latest blow to the Taiwan authorities, the West Africa nation of Burkina Faso severed its ""diplomatic"" relationship with the island and established diplomatic ties with Beijing two days later. The break left Taiwan with only 18 allies around the world. Taiwan has lost four since Tsai Ing-wen's election in early 2016. The decision of these countries to cut ties with the island was made after gauging the strength of the two sides across the Straits and the future of the Taiwan authorities. If the Tsai authorities continue denying the one-China policy, it's believed sooner or later their remaining allies will follow suit, proactively breaking with the island and choosing to get on board the fast train of mainland development. The day the number of Taiwan's allies hits zero is not far off. More countries are welcomed to end ties with the island and establish diplomatic relations with Beijing. While at the same time, the mainland needs to be vigilant against Taiwan independence forces making a final desperate plunge. Losing allies could be used by independence forces to win more sympathetic support from the Taiwanese public. Tsai lashed out at Beijing after Burkina Faso's desertion, saying the mainland ""touched Taiwan society's bottom line"" and her authorities would ""no longer tolerate this."" Her goal was rather clear - to portray a depressing image of Taiwan being ""suppressed"" by Beijing and fan anti-mainland sentiments within the island. Vigilance is also needed against the US providing more assistance for Taiwan's attempt to join international organizations. According to Taiwan media, one day after Burkina Faso's announcement of ending ties with Taiwan, Republican Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado and Democrat Senator Edward J. Markey introduced a bill aimed at developing a policy for the US to support Taiwan's participation in international organizations. Gardner, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific and International Cybersecurity Policy, added Taipei to his official tour of Asia on Saturday to lend support to Taiwan. The US, the EU and Japan also expressed their support for Taiwan participating in the World Health Organization and its assembly. The mainland must be prepared to deal with such pressure from other major powers. It must also mull over how to prevent Taiwan independence forces cajoling sympathy to fan anger within the island. After all, independence still has a certain amount of support among the Taiwan public. A detailed plan should be made to deal with independence forces step by step and not give them a break. The mainland should also prepare for reunifying Taiwan by force while making continuous efforts to seek a peaceful reunification. Beijing will never allow any separatists to split Taiwan from the country. The Tsai authorities had better return to the correct track of abiding by the 1992 consensus, not misjudge the situation and not push things into a worst-case scenario. "	5/27/18	0	0	0.9686	1
"Taiwan’s dollar diplomacy doomed to end in failurenIllustration: Luo Xuan/GT The African country Burkina Faso on May 24 declared it would break off diplomatic relations with Taiwan. On May 26, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Alpha Barry, the foreign minister of Burkina Faso, jointly signed a communique to resume diplomatic ties. It showed the limitations of Taiwan's dollar diplomacy. Foreign assistance without economic and trade relations is hard to maintain, when it comes to projects. But Taiwan has only one purpose, which is to maintain the number of so-called ""diplomatic alliances"" while offering foreign aid. It does not pay attention to the development of economic and trade relations. Red broomcorn is the main agricultural product of Burkina Faso. Taiwan invested $3.9 million in Burkina Faso in 2006 to carry out a cooperation project, together with Germany, to experiment with making medical disinfectants with broomcorn. The experiment succeeded in 2009. However, the project came to a stop before commercial production. Without using aid as leverage to mobilize commercial capital, projects can hardly develop and progress due to the lack of a market operation mechanism. The assistance projects will end up as ""isolated islands"" on the industrial chain, with no connections to upper- and lower-steam industries. Assistance not aimed at promoting local economic development will not build solid economic and trade relations. Taiwan's foreign assistance model has the goal of gaining more ""diplomatic"" partners. Capital with a commercial purpose or on the private level has a hard time to get involved. Trade between Taiwan and Burkina Faso was only $13 million in 2015, while bilateral trade between the Chinese mainland and Burkina Faso was $395 million. There are only 30 small and medium-sized Taiwan companies doing business in Burkina Faso, but at least 600 mainland-based companies including Huawei and ZTE are actively cooperating with local businesses and creating ""employment miracles."" Similar situations can be seen in some other countries that are considered Taiwan's ""iron friends."" The ""foreign relations"" bought by Taiwan don't last because they do not have a solid base at the private level. The mainland has a different foreign assistance model. Foreign assistance, foreign investment and foreign trade are deeply intertwined. These three channels are in line with the mainland's image as well. They have a common function and logic, serving as necessary conditions to promote economic development. The China International Development Cooperation Agency was inaugurated in April, meaning the country's assistance to Africa has moved to a new level. To build a community of shared future for China and Africa, foreign assistance, foreign investment and foreign trade must be integrated, with better allocation of resources and a goal of expanding the effects of development achievements. This approach helps with poverty reduction and government modernization, and it also injects long-lasting dynamism into sound Sino-Africa relations. There are only 18 ""diplomatic allies"" left for Taiwan. It is hard to tell who will be the next to break ""diplomatic"" ties with Taiwan, but its dollar diplomacy surely has a gloomy future.

"Royal Bank of Canada labels Taiwan as part of ChinanRoyal Bank of Canada labels Taiwan as part of China Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) has designated Taiwan as a province of China following a similar move by Air Canada, the Global Times found on its official website on Sunday. ""It's glad to see RBC finally corrected the mistake it made, and did what it should have done long time ago. The island of Taiwan is a part of China… It's global common sense,"" Tian Yun, director of the China Society of Macroeconomics Research Center, told the Global Times on Sunday. Established in 1864, RBC, which also operates centers in Beijing and Hong Kong, is the largest bank in Canada by market capitalization. RBC was quoted as saying in a report by the Vancouver-based Star Vancouver on Saturday that it ""has been leveraging the International Organization for Standardization for country descriptions."" ""As part of our commitment to responding to the needs of our clients, we will be making updates to our system to change how Taiwan is listed,"" it said. However, the Canadian bank did not answer questions with regard to ""when the designation began, whether the Chinese government was involved, nor why Taiwan is listed as a province of China, and a follow-up question about what the 'updates' will be,"" the report noted. RBC could not be reached by the Global Times as of press time. The designation made by RBC came closely after Air Canada, the largest airline in Canada, labeled Taiwan as part of China on its booking website on May 15, following a list of air carriers that made similar changes. On April 25, Chinese Civil Aviation Administration sent a letter to 36 foreign airlines demanding changes to the way Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan are referenced on their official websites and promotional material. In response, global airlines including Air Canada, British Airways and Lufthansa now refer to Taiwan explicitly as part of China despite the US calling the request ""Orwellian nonsense"" in a statement released on May 5. The Chinese Foreign Ministry responded on May 7 at a regular press conference, saying that ""whatever the US said will not change the objective fact that there is only one China in the world and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan are indispensable parts of Chinese territory."" The ministry also urged foreign companies operating in China to respect the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, adding that China's relations with foreign countries will be conducted in accordance with its one-China policy. ""The US is continuously making trouble with the Taiwan question. RBC's designation is a positive response to the US' provocation,"" said Tian, adding that of course more companies would ""correct their mistakes"" in the near future. China is making its stance quite clear, which is ""if you want to do business with China, you have to obey China's rules. It is rather reasonable,"" Tian noted. "	5/27/18	0	0	0.7648	1

In the letter, Callans apologized to the Formosan Association for Public Affairs for not listing Taiwan as a country on the Costco jobs website.

"Muji Shanghai branch fined for Taiwan packaging errornA subsidiary of the Japanese household goods, apparel and food company Ryohin Keikaku Co was fined 200,000 yuan ($31,000) by a Shanghai bureau for not checking imported packaging that listed the island of Taiwan as a country, according to media reports on Wednesday. Muji (Shanghai) Co Ltd was fined by Shanghai Administration for Industry and Commerce for 119 clothes hangars imported from Japan that ""wrongly marked Taiwan as the country of some items' origin,"" China Industry & Commerce News reported on Wednesday. The branch was not fulfilling its responsibilities in supervising its items and selling products, according to information from the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System. The Japanese company had failed to check the products properly before making the hangars available at Muji's online and offline Chinese shops, in violation of China's Advertisement Law that no advertising should damage China's national dignity or interests, or leak confidential information. Apart from fining the company, the Shanghai bureau required Muji's Shanghai branch to stop spreading illegal advertising, withdraw the relevant products and destroy the packaging. In January, Muji was warned by China's mapping authorities ""wrongly marking Taiwan"" in an advertising flier. Muji could not be reached before press time.

"Taiwan whips out the censor’s pen for books published on the Chinese mainlandnPeople read books at a bookstore in Taipei. Photo: VCG Booksellers and publishers on the island of Taiwan are calling for a revision of a 2003 regulation on introducing publications from the Chinese mainland, after Taiwan regulators shocked the industry by requiring censorship of such books, an unprecedented move since Taiwan abolished the Publication Act. Earlier this month, Taiwan's cultural regulators sent a notice to publishers and associations, asking them to submit an application for publishing books from the mainland, Taiwan-based news site udn.com reported. Publishing such books without the approval of Taiwan's ""Ministry of Culture"" will lead to ""administrative penalties,"" said the report. Shock and confusion ""The demand for review was never raised before. It's a huge reversal of freedom of the press,"" Taiwan bookseller Shen Rongyu told the Global Times on Wednesday. Since 2005, Shen's store has sold over 8 million books from the mainland, and the bookseller expected higher sales because of the booming publishing industry across the Straits. However, over 2,000 books the store ordered from Shanghai and Hangzhou are now stranded en route to Taiwan as they need to be ""reviewed,"" said Shen. When Shen filed the application for ""review"" earlier this week, officials in Taiwan told him ""they have no time due to staff shortage."" Applying for review of books introduced from the mainland is not an easy job, as booksellers have to submit documents including contract and proxy notes, said Shen. What's more confusing is that the new rule has come at a time Taiwan's publishing industry is struggling with bookstores being shut down, while business on the mainland is booming as the government steps up efforts to popularize the reading habit, said a business director surnamed Zhang at the Taiwan-based Dragon Totem Cultural Limited. Exchange of books could help people across the Straits, especially the young generation, to get closer to one another, Zhang told the Global Times. The company has introduced 700 books from the mainland since it was set up seven years ago. The books are published in traditional Chinese characters in Taiwan, said Zhang. Legal Changes The censorship decision was made according to articles of a regulation on mainland publications in 2003, though such a requirement has never been evoked before, Taiwan media said. The notice also triggered wide discussion about amending the articles, as Taiwan publishers expressed strong concerns over a trend of scrutinizing publications in the future. According to the regulation, newspapers, magazines, films, and television and radio broadcasts from the mainland also need approval before being introduced in Taiwan. The regulation also bans publications that promote Communism, an article regarded ""unconstitutional"" as it goes against a judicial interpretation made in 2008, renowned Taiwanese publisher Chen Ying-ching was quoted as saying by udn.com. The response of Taiwan's publishing industry makes it all the more necessary to revise the regulation and to avoid such moves in the future, said Zhang. Lu Ching-cheng, president of the Association of Taipei Publishers, said that several industry associations are discussing changes that need to be brought about in the regulation, World Journal, a US-based Chinese-language newspaper, reported. Instead of being considerate toward the needs of the people, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is going the other way and continues to set barriers to impede normal exchange across the Straits, An Fengshan, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said at a press conference Wednesday. What DPP is actually restricting is bigger and better opportunities for Taiwan compatriots, said An. The notice intends to alienate the mainland as ""pro-independence"" forces in Taiwan are scared of larger exchange across the Straits, Lü Cuncheng, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told Global Times. A closer interaction between people on both sides is unavoidable as the mainland is becoming increasingly alluring for Taiwan locals and more preferential policies will be introduced to facilitate their work and life on the mainland, Lü said. According to An, the mainland will continue to promote the implementation of the 31 preferential policies for Taiwan. Introduced in 2013, the policies cover legal rights, education, culture, and tourism, and are aimed at improving the lives of all Taiwan people. "	5/17/18	0	0	0.6115	1
"US lawmakers send letter to WHO that interferes with China sovereigntynA US House of Representatives' letter to the World Health Organization (WHO) demanding an observer seat for Taiwan at the upcoming World Health Assembly was downright interference in China's internal affairs, a Chinese observer said on Thursday. Initiated by the House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, the letter was jointly sent by 172 members of House of Representatives urging WHO to register, without any preconditions, Taiwan as an observer for the assembly in Geneva, Switzerland from May 21 to 26, reported Taiwan-based news website chinatimes.com. The move violated the one-China principle, which is already recognized by the US government, Yang Lixian, a specially appointed researcher at the Beijing-based Research Center on Cross-Strait Relations, told the Global Times on Thursday. The letter claimed that rejection of Taiwan observing at the assembly violated the principal rules of the WHO that ""the health of all is essential to peace and security, and it relies on full cooperation between individuals and countries,"" chinatimes.com said. The US has strengthened interference in China's internal affairs, Yang said, while noting that the move showed endorsement for ""Taiwan independence,"" but it could be merely a chip to bargain in negotiating with Beijing on other matters. Taiwan authorities should rethink why they were rebuffed by the assembly instead of passing the buck and misleading Taiwan compatriots and the international community, An Fengshan, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council in Beijing, said on Wednesday. The reason why Taiwan was able to observe at the assembly from 2009 to 2016 was the fact that both sides of the Straits adhered to the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus, he reiterated. These political foundations and preconditions were undermined by Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party, who refuses to recognize the one-China principle and 1992 Consensus, An said. Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen took office on May 20, 2016. The Taiwan authorities have only themselves to blame for failing to receive an invitation this year, Yang noted. The year 2017 was the first that Taiwan was not invited to the assembly after being an observer for eight consecutive years. WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in May last year that the organization would keep upholding the one-China principle and properly handle Taiwan-related issues on the basis of resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and the World Health Assembly, news website haiwainet.cn reported.

"After Abe’s statement, Taiwan’s Tsai should give up her illusionsnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT Chinese Premier Li Keqiang urged Japan to keep its promise of sticking to the one-China policy on the Taiwan issue during talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on May 9, according to Xinhua. Abe responded by saying that Japan will only have non-governmental exchanges with Taiwan in keeping with Tokyo's agreement with Beijing. Abe's statement drew headlines in Taiwan with media outlets saying it was the first time he had gone public with his stance on Taiwan after being re-elected. Although Taiwan authorities haven't responded, it is no less serious than losing another of its ""diplomatic allies."" Abe's statement is predictable. During Japan's ""Golden Week"" in early May, the pro-Taiwan Japanese parliamentarians in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) didn't visit Taiwan as they used to in the past. Instead, only a few parliamentarians in the non-ruling parties visited Taiwan. Abe's brother Nobuo Kishi, the main backer of Japan's ""relations with Taiwan,"" suddenly cancelled his trip one week before his planned visit to Taiwan in early May. These facts indicate that the Abe administration is exercising restraint on the Taiwan issue, and this somehow reflects the Japanese prime minister's sincerity in improving China-Japan relations. Abe's promise shows that ""Taiwan independence"" and Taiwan authorities are just tools of Japan to deal with its relations with China. Since January 2016, when Tsai Ing-wen was elected leader of Taiwan, there have been interactions between the Abe administration and Taiwan authorities. For example, Japan's Senior Vice Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications, Jiro Akama, visited Taiwan in March 2017, and Japan renamed its ""Interchange Association"" in Taiwan ""Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association."" Such interactions made Taiwan authorities illusionary. For instance, they sought to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement led by Japan, and hinted at joining the ""Indo-Pacific"" strategy in which Japan is a participant. It's worth noting that in the past two years, Japan cooperated with the US in rebalancing the Asia-Pacific strategy and meddled in the South China Sea issue, which sent Sino-Japanese ties into a tailspin. The Abe administration's then diplomatic strategy toward China was a policy of containment, hence the need for developing ""relations"" with Taiwan. As China-Japan relations improve, Tokyo will lose, instead of gaining, if it still uses Taiwan as a bargaining chip. Abe's statement again shows the fact that ""relations"" between Japan and Taiwan are secondary to Sino-Japanese ties, no matter how close Japan and Taiwan are. Since Abe has explicitly stated his stance, Taiwan authorities should stop being delusional. In fact, Abe and Tsai are personal friends. Before being elected leader of Taiwan, Tsai paid a few visits to Japan as Chairman of DPP. In 2010 and 2011, Abe visited Taiwan twice as ex-prime minister, and held talks with Tsai. In 2016, Abe sent his congratulations after Tsai was elected leader of Taiwan. However, Abe's promise shows that national interest always comes first, and Taiwan authorities' pro-Japan steps are just wishful thinking. Tsai should drop the illusionary idea of opposing Chinese mainland and seeking ""Taiwan independence"" taking advantage of games between major powers. Abe's statement on the Taiwan issue is certainly worth appreciating. However, we still need to be vigilant. Although his statement will shock Japan's pro-Taiwan and Taiwan independence groups, it may not end the collusion between Japan and Taiwan. After all, Tokyo still maintains ambiguous ""relations"" with Taiwan since 1972 when China and Japan normalized ties. Besides, Japan and Taiwan repeatedly tested the bottom-line of the one-China policy and collaborations between politicians in Japan and Taiwan have become common. Therefore, we have to wait and see whether Abe's statement is an opportunist act or a long-term policy toward Taiwan, and whether Taiwan authorities will wake up to reality and stop being under an illusion.

"Taiwan splurges on ‘futile’ arms: expertnTaiwan splurges on ‘futile’ arms: expert Taiwan is reportedly planning a NT$600 billion ($20.11 billion) military acquisition in a ""futile"" independence effort that will only end in failure, a Chinese mainland analyst noted on Thursday. Taiwan is spending the NT$600 billion on buying F-35 fighter jets and M1A1 tanks from the US while also seeking to independently develop its own submarines, aircraft and warships, Taipei-based China Times reported on Wednesday. The Taiwan Defense Industry Development Association and the US-Taiwan Business Council held the Taiwan-US Defense Business Forum in Kaohsiung, Taiwan on Thursday, the first time US and Taiwan defense companies communicated in Taiwan, Taipei-based media The China Post reported Thursday. The military funding plan is Taiwan's latest attempt to oppose reunification with force, which is destined to end in failure, Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Thursday. ""No matter how Taiwan arms its army, they will always be outnumbered by the People's Liberation Army,"" Song said. ""So I believe this effort is useless and has no value at all."" Another goal of military funding was to promote weapons development in Taiwan, aiming to realize an independent defense, said Song. Taiwan had arms exports in mind and hoped to incubate a military industry that could contribute to the Taiwan economy, he believed. Taiwan-based organizations including the Cross-Strait Peaceful Development Forum and Taiwan's Labor Party published a joint statement Thursday saying that the US was loading the dice on Taiwan and using the Tsai Ing-wen administration as a stumbling block to contain the Chinese mainland development. They criticized Tsai for being a pawn of the US and predicted serious consequences for purchasing weapons and military equipment from the US, China Times reported. ""Taiwan lacks the ability to develop its own weapons,"" Song said. ""They are largely dependent on foreign corollary equipment. They are not capable of military development at all, not to mention exports. They do not own the core technologies. They can only assemble the parts."" It was not possible for Taiwan to earn money from arms sales, Song said, ""nor can they create a defense industry like they are hoping for. It's all futile."" Only after Taiwan turns back and firmly adheres to the 1992 Consensus and the one-China policy can cross-Straits relations be handled well, with a peaceful solution to reunification, Song noted. ""Taiwan should not go any further on the road of independence. This is a road with no return,"" Song said. "	5/10/18	0	0	-0.7781	-1
"Tsai is wrong on Korean summit comparisonnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen compared inter-Korean relations to cross-Straits ties in a televised interview on Monday. She claimed that as North Korea n leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in addressed each other in their meeting in April, leaders of the Chinese mainland and Taiwan should meet similarly on the basis of equality without any political preconditions.

"S.Korean airline hailed by Chinese netizens for changing Taiwan categorynKorean airline company Asiana Airlines has placed Taiwan under the category Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan on its website, in contrast with US airline companies. Asiana Airlines recently moved Taiwan from the ""Southeast Asia"" category into the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan category. The move came after the White House recently indicated that American citizens and private companies would not list Taiwan, Hong Kong and Maca0 as part of China. Many Chinese netizens hailed the move by Asiana Airlines, with many saying they are making the right decision and that it could encourage more tourism to South Korea. ""Do not try to follow the US in every matter. The US only wants to irritate China but it knows the Chinese mainland and Taiwan markets well. South Korea is smarter,"" read one comment on Sina Weibo. It is normal to see that South Korea isn't following the US in the Taiwan question, Lü Chao, a research fellow at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday. South Korea, a US military ally, has placed much more importance on Sino-South Korean ties recently, which has seen an improvement after South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office, Lü said. South Korea cannot risk suffering economic losses again as it has learned from previous lessons, such as tensions over THAAD and the boycott of Lotte Group, he added. The Chinese Civil Aviation Administration released a notice in April asking foreign air carriers - including a number of American airlines - to stop referring to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao as separate countries. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told the press on Sunday that foreign firms operating in China should respect the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and observe Chinese laws and respect the feelings of the Chinese people. Japan Airlines, however, still puts Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan in a position equivalent to China's. US airline companies, including American Airlines and United Airlines, that list Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao as separate nations remained unchanged as of press time. "	5/8/18	0	0	0.9778	1
"Taiwan deepening defense cooperation with US dangerous, say Chinese expertsnAnalysts warned that Taiwan deepening its defense cooperation with the US is a dangerous move that will cross a red line for the Chinese mainland and invoke strong responses. The US-Taiwan Business Council and the Taiwan Defense Industry Development Association will be hosting the Taiwan-US Defense Business Forum in Kaohsiung, Taiwan island on Thursday. This event is said to ""bring together US and Taiwan companies to discuss granular challenges of bilateral cooperation in the defense industry supply chain."" No US officials will be attending the forum and US defense firms will not send high-level representatives, Taipei-based news website chinatimes.com reported. The report quoted an anonymous source as saying that the Tsai Ing-wen administration wants the forum to maintain a low profile so as not to provoke the Chinese mainland while making significant breakthroughs in US-Taiwan military exchanges. ""The deepening US defense cooperation with Taiwan is an act of gross interference in China's domestic affairs. It's a very serious matter for the Chinese mainland,"" said Zhu Songling, a professor at the institute of Taiwan studies in Beijing Union University. ""Further moves that promote concrete military exchanges will invoke a strong response from the mainland, even prompt the Chinese mainland to use non-peaceful means to resolve the Taiwan question,"" he said. Tsai on Monday called for talks between Taiwan and the mainland ""without any political preconditions on the basis of respect and equality"" when asked to comment on the historic summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Chinese mainland analysts said such a meeting would be impossible as Tsai refuses to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus, which emphasizes the one-China policy. ""Tsai knew very well her proposal is nothing but empty words to alleviate pressure from public opinion,"" Zhu said. ""Any official cross-Straits interactions must be based on the 1992 Consensus and the acknowledgement that both sides are of one nation and one people."" Cross-Straits relations have plummeted since Tsai took office in 2016. In April the People's Liberation Army conducted live-fire military exercises in the Taiwan Straits and twice sent warplanes to patrol the island a week after Taiwan's administrative head Lai Ching-te said that he was a ""Taiwan independence"" worker.

"Chinese netizens slam US Embassy over Taiwan listing by airlinesnChinese netizens swarmed into the US Embassy's Sina Weibo account to criticize it for making excuses for some US airlines companies which listed Taiwan as a country after the embassy posted a statement on Monday calling China to ""stop threatening American companies."" The Chinese Civil Aviation Administration released a notice in April, asking foreign air carriers - including a number of American airlines - to stop referring to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao as separate countries. The US Embassy posted a statement on its Sina Weibo on Monday, repeating the White House Press Secretary's remarks on Saturday and saying the move ""Orwellian nonsense"" and ""part of a growing trend by the Chinese Communist Party to impose its political views on American citizens and private companies."" The statement received fierce criticism from Chinese netizens after it was released. A net user, ""Guodaye,"" said, ""Do in accordance with our laws and regulations if you want to do business in China, otherwise get out of China!"" Another net user said, ""This is not an issue of political correctness, this is about the one-China policy. The US should respect the Three Joint Communiqués."" A third net user, ""Tongxinpaotuan,"" wrote, ""This is also not an issue about any party. Anyone would stand up to stop speeches or deeds on separating a country. The US has never stopped imposing its political correctness on other countries and has acted willfully to impose sanctions or overturn a regime once it goes against US democracy."" The US Embassy's statement also said that US President Donald Trump will ""stand up for Americans resisting efforts"" by the Communist Party of China ""to impose Chinese political correctness on American companies and citizens."" In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang reiterated China's stance on Monday that ""whatever the US said will never change the objective fact that there is only one China in the world and that Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions are inalienable parts of China's territory."" ""The incident shows that the US wants to seek leverage by playing the Taiwan card but has no balls to cross the one-China policy. We have one question for the White House, 'Does the statement imply the US is considering giving up the one-China policy?' And the answer is no,"" Shen Yi, deputy director of Fudan University's cyberspace management center, told the Global Times. Shen said the US Embassy is trying to confuse the public by mixing the one-China policy with freedom of speech as the Monday statement mentioned China's management on the internet. The US released the statement to pin its hopes on pro-US netizens in China, but history has proven that only a few people would like to play the ""traitor"" role. And the majority of Chinese netizens are reasonable enough to differentiate internal friction and contradictions from the outside enemies, Shen said. ""The US Embassy's statement unexpectedly unites the voice of the public as many regard it as an abuse from the US government. And the US did impropriety this time,"" Zhang Yiwu, a professor of Chinese literature at Peking University, told the Global Times. The US Embassy released another post on Monday, saying that family members of Uyghur reporters were detained for releasing ""Chinese authorities suppressing Uyghur people and other Muslim groups."" The post also ignited rage and questions among Chinese netizens, with many asking, ""How did the embassy conclude that the Uyghur people are suppressed in China?"" and ""How dare the US criticize others when it drops bombs on the Middle East?""

"Taiwan authorities have only themselves to blame for being rebuffed by WHA: FMnTaiwan authorities have only themselves to blame for being rebuffed by WHA: FM Taiwan authorities have only themselves to blame for being rejected by the World Health Assembly again this year, China's foreign ministry said on Monday. The one-China principle is internationally recognized, ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular press conference on Monday. The reason why Taiwan was able to observe at the assembly from 2009 to 2016 was the fact that both sides adhered to the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus, he said. These political foundations have been undermined by the Democratic Progressive Party of Taiwan refusing to recognize the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus, he said. The deadline for online registration to attend the assembly already passed on Monday. The Taiwan authorities have only themselves to blame for failing to receive an invitation this year, Geng said. Chinese observers hailed the decision, saying that such a development further frustrates recent rampant Taiwan pro-independence secessionists and shows the one-China principle is increasingly cherished by the international community. Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen's administration has not recognized the one-China principle, Yang Lixian, vice secretary-general of the National Society of Taiwan Studies, told the Global Times. Tsai took office on May 20, 2016. The Tsai administration openly recruits secessionist personalities and has led the island down a narrowing, doomed path, Yang said. The people of Taiwan should understand that the US, despite recent moves that seemingly endorse independence, is only using the island as a bargaining chip in negotiating with Beijing on other matters, Yang noted. The year 2017 was the first in eight years that Taiwan was not invited to the assembly. Cross-Straits understanding between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan has been the basis for the invitation for the Taiwan representatives as observers since 2009, World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman Christian Lindmeier was quoted as saying by The Diplomat last year. ""One-China policy is a UN-wide accepted policy. Beijing is representing the one China,"" he said. The World Health Assembly is the WHO's supreme decision-making body and generally meets in Geneva in May each year, according to the WHO official website.

"White House statement misleads US firms: analystsnA harshly worded White House statement released Saturday in response to China's legitimate demand for corrections to how airlines refer to the country's territories is at odds with internationally recognized facts and ignores the power of Chinese consumers, Chinese observers said Sunday. Commenting on the statement from the White House, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular press conference on Sunday that ""Nothing can change the objective facts that there is but one China in the world, and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan are inalienable parts of China, regardless of what the US says."" ""This is Orwellian nonsense and part of a growing trend by the Chinese Communist Party to impose its political views on American citizens and private companies,'' White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Saturday in a statement. China remains committed to the ""one-China"" policy when handling its ties with foreign countries, Geng said, adding that foreign firms operating in China should respect the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and observe Chinese laws and respect the feelings of Chinese people. Earlier this year United Airlines, American Airlines and several others, received letters from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) urging the airlines to refer to China's Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao. Hou Yinan, head of the publicity department of the CAAC, confirmed with the Global Times on Sunday that the administration did release a statement in April urging foreign airlines operating in the country including US companies, to stop referring on their official website to China's territories including Taiwan as countries. Hou added that such a development ""is not targeted at any particular government, but is part of its correction campaign that started at the end of January when the CAAC summoned Delta Airlines to immediately correct and apologize in public for listing Tibet and Taiwan as countries."" CAAC will require all foreign airlines operating flights to China to immediately carry out comprehensive reviews of their websites, apps and other customer-related information channels, and to strictly comply with China's laws and regulations, so as to prevent similar occurrences, read an English statement issued on February 7 on the CAAC website. Cold War mentality Sanders said in the statement that US President Donald Trump ""ran against political correctness in the United States"" and as president he will ""stand up for Americans resisting efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to impose Chinese political correctness on American companies and citizens,"" AP reported on Saturday. Chinese analysts condemned the nasty tone of the statement from the White House. ""It is the US that has been imposing incorrect views regarding Taiwan to its people and companies by trumping up Taiwan as a politically independent entity which is at odds with the internationally recognized fact,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University's Institute of International Relations in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday. ""George Orwell in his Animal Farm and 1984 published in the 1940s, leveled satires at the Soviet Union's system. Using such terms to attack China shows that US elites still stubbornly take China as a Soviet Union-like authoritarian nation, and are trapped in their Cold War mentality, neglecting the fact that China's socialist market economy is full of diversity,"" Li said Public opinion Earlier in January, Marriot International was ordered by Chinese cyberspace regulators to shut down its Chinese website and app as Chinese internet users lambasted the hotel chain for identifying Tibet as a country. ""Chinese civilians are playing increasingly bigger roles in protecting the country's sovereignty, as their voice is becoming more rational and more influential and they could deal a punch to the companies by boycotting them,"" Bai Ming, deputy director of the International Market Research Institute under the Ministry of Commerce, told the Global Times on Sunday. In March, Trump signed ""the Taiwan Travel Act"" allowing for the first time in decades US officials of all levels to travel to Taiwan. In April, the US State Department also approved a marketing license allowing US defense companies to sell submarine-building technology to Taiwan. Li suggested that the US should understand that its moves cannot change the fact that ""Taiwan is an inalienable part of China,"" and if it really wants to change this fact, it needs to, at least, be mentally prepared for serious damage to bilateral ties.

"Message to Taiwan ‘independence’ fantasistsnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT China and the Dominican Republic signed a joint communiqué in Beijing Tuesday on the establishment of diplomatic relations. The government of the Dominican Republic severed so-called diplomatic relations with Taiwan on the same day. Taiwan donated 90 Hummer vehicles to the island country in the Caribbean in March.For Taiwan authorities, it was an act of containment from the Chinese mainland. However, it is actually not the Chinese mainland which has been oppressing Taiwan, but Taiwan itself.During the long period of confrontation across the Taiwan Straits, both sides once fought fiercely to represent China. However, with the Chinese mainland's vast territory, large population and increasing national strength, the world has recognized that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. No matter how the two sides fight, they abided by the principle of the one-China policy.But it seems that Taiwan independence forces, represented by Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), has a ridiculous logic - since Taiwan can't represent all of China, then they would rather promote Taiwan independence. They no longer call the other side of the Straits ""the Chinese mainland"" but call it ""China,"" and claim that ""China"" is ""oppressing"" Taiwan if it ""snatches"" Taiwan's ""diplomatic allies.""There hasn't been, and will never be a ""country"" called Taiwan. Taiwan has and always will belong to China. When the Dominican Republic established ties with China, it recognized that there is but one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory.After nearly 69 years of vicissitudes, China has grown into the second largest economy in the world, and is still climbing to the top with its medium-high growth rate. If the Chinese mainland's GDP per capita reaches South Korea's level, its total GDP will be double that of the US and if it reaches Hong Kong's level, triple.The interests of the Chinese mainland are spreading all around the world. It is playing an increasingly decisive role in global affairs and it is the most promising market which greatly attracts countries from across the globe.During the Ma Ying-jeou administration, relations between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan developed peacefully on the basis of the one-China policy and the 1992 Consensus. It not only greatly benefited Taiwan, but also realized a diplomatic truce across the Straits.The Chinese mainland has always been pursuing peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity, and things would never get tough as long as Taiwan adhered to the one-China policy.Taiwan's ""foreign minister"" Joseph Wu claimed that the Chinese mainland used ""dollar diplomacy to convert Taiwan's diplomatic allies."" However, it is the Chinese mainland's great national strength that attracts countries all around the world, including the Dominican Republic.The Chinese mainland is still rising, and it is willing to share its achievements with the world by establishing a community of shared future for mankind, which will only make it more attractive. The other 19 ""diplomatic allies"" of Taiwan will inevitably do what the Dominican Republic did.If the DPP still refuses to admit that there is only one China in the world, the Chinese mainland will not spare Taiwan's feelings anymore. By dreaming of independence, Taiwan is caught in its own trap. It is Taiwan itself that has been oppressing Taiwan.The author is a professor at the University of International Relations. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	5/3/18	0	0	0.9954	1
"China, Dominican Republic cement tiesnDominican Republic Foreign Minister Miguel Vargas (left) shakes hands with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi during a signing ceremony in Beijing on Tuesday. The Dominican Republic on Tuesday established diplomatic relations with China. Photo: AFP China and the Dominican Republic signed a joint communiqué establishing diplomatic ties on Tuesday in Beijing, after the Caribbean nation, which had been Taiwan's largest ""diplomatic ally,"" ended ""diplomatic relations"" with the island. The Dominican Republic government's decision was hailed by Chinese observers on Tuesday, as it makes manifest the Dominican Republic leaders' vision that takes into consideration the country's long-term socioeconomic growth and the interests of its people, as the one-China policy is recognized by the overwhelming majority of countries. ""It is an obvious decision for the Dominican Republic leaders to make and it favors the people of the Dominican Republic and its development. It can now participate in the Belt and Road initiative, Beijing's global development initiative rather than the petty favors offered by Taiwan,"" Liu Yuqin, a former Chinese ambassador to Ecuador, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Presidential adviser Flavio Dario Espinal told reporters at a press conference that his country is convinced bilateral relations with China will have a positive impact on the future of the Caribbean nation, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Tuesday. The Dominican's political and economic sectors were fully consulted before the government made the decision which was mainly based on the ""needs, potential and future outlook"" of the Dominican people, he said. China is the Caribbean country's second largest supplier of imported products, with bilateral trade volume amounting to around $2 billion. The Dominican Republic is China's second largest trade partner in the Caribbean and Central American region, and the growth potential between the two countries is immense, said Xinhua. Liu believes establishing diplomatic ties will benefit people of both countries, bringing cooperation to a higher and deeper level. Rosa Ng Báez, head of the Office of Commercial Development of the Dominican Republic in China, told the Global Times on Tuesday that a new ""embassy"" sign will soon be issued in replacement of the current ""office"" one, and the Dominican Republican national flag has been raised at the iconic Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing. The new embassy will vigorously promote bilateral cooperation in investment and tourism, Rosa Ng Báez said, adding that the Dominican Republic hopes more Chinese companies will invest in the country under the framework of the Belt and Road initiative, and the two nations will build stronger air links to encourage Chinese citizens to visit and work in the Caribbean nation. Additional talks will be held Wednesday between the visiting Dominican Republic official, Jose Ramon Peralta, the Administrative Minister of the Presidency, and Chinese officials to discuss cooperation in various fields, Ng Báez noted. One China In Tuesday's joint communiqué, the Dominican Republic government announced that it ""severs 'diplomatic relations' with Taiwan as of this day,"" while honoring that ""there is but one China in the world and the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory."" The island of Taiwan is now left with only 19 ""diplomatic allies"" around the world, which are mostly developing countries in the Caribbean and Pacific, and according to the CNN on Tuesday. The Dominican Republic was the largest of that group. Given the Chinese mainland's increasingly robust international status and global influence, it is evident Taiwan is rapidly losing sway around the world, Liu said. Liu also dismissed rumors that the Dominican Republic ended its ties with Taiwan to win Beijing's approval for it to become a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, noting that ""it is a decision made according to the larger overall situation, and it is good for its people in the longer term."" Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan on Tuesday met Dominican Foreign Minister Miguel Vargas in Beijing. Wang conveyed Chinese President Xi Jinping's greetings to Dominican President Danilo Medina, and extended congratulations on the establishment of diplomatic ties. Wang said that while recognizing and upholding the one-China principle, the Dominican government has made a political decision to sever ""diplomatic relations"" with Taiwan and forge diplomatic ties with China, which conforms to the trend of the times and is in line with the fundamental and long-term interests of the two countries and two peoples.

"PLA sends planes round Taiwan for second time in a weeknThe People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force has sent warplanes for the second time in a week to patrol around the island of Taiwan in a gesture to deter ""Taiwan independence"" forces and show the Chinese mainland's resolution to safeguard sovereignty. According to the official Sina Weibo account of the PLA Air Force, H-6K bombers, fighter jets, reconnaissance planes and Air Early Warning planes took off from military airports Thursday morning and conducted real-combat military training. The warplanes flew over the Miyako and Bashi straits to complete their circuit of the island. The Chinese air force's ability to prepare for and fight a war has experienced a historic shift, Shen Jinke, a PLA Air Force spokesman, said at a military air base in East China's Fujian Province. ""The PLA Air Force has firm resolution, ample confidence and sufficient capability to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Shen said. Wu Qian, defense ministry spokesman, also said on Thursday that the PLA will take further actions if ""Taiwan independence"" forces continue to act without restraint. Taiwan's administrative head Lai Ching-te said earlier that he was a ""Taiwan independence"" worker drawing ire from Beijing. China conducted live-fire military exercises in the Taiwan Straits on April 18. On April 19, the PLA Air Force dispatched bombers to patrol around Taiwan to practice and upgrade their capability to protect national sovereignty and territorial integrity, according to an official air force statement. On Wednesday, Taiwan media reported that the US dispatched two B-52 bombers to fly near the Dongsha Islands, calling such a move ""a response to the PLA's recent military exercises surrounding Taiwan"" and claiming the flight path of the bombers was ""a typical flight course for attack."" China's defense ministry said Thursday the PLA has learned about the relevant situation. Song Zhongping, a military commentator, told the Global Times that the B-52 flight course suggested a patrol, not an attack. ""In terms of air defense capability, the PLA Navy and Air Force are able to cover the entire East China Sea, the island of Taiwan, the Yellow Sea and the majority of the South China Sea,"" he said. ""Two B-52 bombers, which is an older model, can barely achieve strategic deterrence, let alone attack,"" Song noted. "	4/26/18	0	0	0.128	1
"More PLA moves await Taiwan separatistsnMore PLA moves await Taiwan separatists Chinese aircraft including H-6K bombers and fighter jets flew around Taiwan recently after passing over the Bashi Channel and Miyako Strait, according to the People's Liberation Army Air Force. Wu Qian, Chinese defense ministry spokesman, warned if Taiwan independence forces continue to wantonly take rash actions, the PLA will take further steps. The live-fire exercises in the Taiwan Straits and the flights around Taiwan conducted by the PLA to specifically target Taiwan independence forces in recent days have shocked the island. Still some separatists attempted to embolden themselves by hyping their US support. It was reported by Taiwan media on Wednesday that a pair of US B-52 bombers flew within 250 kilometers of Guangdong Province's coastline in South China. Taiwanese media outlets hyped the flight route as indicating the bombers could have been involved in a mock attack of launching cruise missiles that could reach the mainland. However, both the Pentagon and US media made no mention of the flight by press time. The Taiwan independence forces had better abandon their dream that the US can protect them. Military competition between the mainland and the US in the West Pacific is not all about Taiwan. The only way for Taiwan separatists to preserve their safety is to mind their words and deeds. The defense ministry announced Thursday that the Dongfeng-26 ballistic missile has been commissioned into the PLA Rocket Force. The new medium- and long-range ballistic missile will serve for both nuclear and conventional precision strikes, against targets on land and in the sea. It's a new weapon to strengthen PLA deterrence. The Taiwan independence forces should carefully study the strategic impact of this missile on the Taiwan Straits situation. The mounting military pressure against Taiwan independence forces is a response to the escalation of their separatist activities. The Democratic Progressive Party is keen to woo the US to get more involved in the Taiwan question. As a result, the PLA will build up its preparations for military conflicts. The Taiwan question will not easily become a military showdown. But the activity of the Taiwan independence forces will intensify military wrestling, lead to military confrontation and disputes, even a crisis. Taiwan will finally find that with the mainland and the US turning Taiwan into a focus of their competition, the island will slip into a powder barrel. Mainland military aircraft will fly closer and closer to Taiwan and in the end fly above the island. If the Taiwan authorities openly promote the ""Taiwan independence"" policy and cut off all official contacts with the mainland, the mainland will deem Taiwan a hostile regime and has endless means to deal with it. The US cannot prevent the mainland exerting military pressure on Taiwan. If Taiwanese society is willing to support Taiwan independence forces at any cost, they can take the plunge. But the Taiwan authorities should assess whether the Taiwanese public is willing to pay the price. The mainland's flights and live-fire exercises are a clear warning to Taiwan independence forces. It's unknown whether the two B-52 bombers really flew close to the mainland. Even if they did, two B-52 bombers are far from enough to deter the mainland. But the actions taken by the PLA have changed many people's expectations on how the Taiwan question will be solved. This is just a start. "	4/26/18	0	0	-0.8925	-1
"Crossing Beijing’s red line comes at a real pricenIllustration: Liu Rui/GT Tensions have been escalating in the Taiwan Straits. The US passed the Taiwan Travel Act that allows reciprocal visits of high-level officials between Taiwan and the US, challenging the one-China policy. If US President Donald Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, visits Taiwan in June or a US navy vessel visits a Taiwanese naval base, that will destroy Sino-US relations. The head of Taiwan's administrative authority, Lai Ching-te has been obstinately promoting ""Taiwan independence,"" and Taiwan authorities are lowering the threshold for a referendum on Taiwan's independence. All these things touch Beijing's red line and the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) must deter ""Taiwan independence"" separatist forces through strong means to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.Four factors are needed for effective deterrence: strength, means, channels to convey determination and credibility. A military drill combines these four elements. In 1995 and 1996, in response to then Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui's visit to the US and challenging of the one-China policy, the mainland conducted exercises that included testing missiles in waters surrounding Taiwan and mobilizing forces in East China's Fujian Province, which is located directly across the straits from Taiwan island. Now some pro-Taiwan US congressmen and Taiwan separatists are undermining the one-China policy. This is something we will not ignore.In military strength, the mainland's defense budget reached 1.1 trillion yuan ($1,748) this year, 20 times that of 1996 and 16 times that of today's Taiwan. In 1996, the number of mainland conventional weapons of a similar or higher quality exceeded that of Taiwan. By now the quantity and capability of mainland weapons are better than that of Taiwan. Do Taiwan military forces have any equipment to counter the PLA equipment shown during recent navy exercises in the South China Sea?In 1996, our army did not have enough military means. But now the PLA has information system-versus-system operational capability. The PLA Air Force has strategic bombers to launch raids on targets or carpet bomb the island. The air force also has third- and fourth-generation fighter jets that would take precedence over Taiwan's troops.The PLA Navy has aircraft carriers and new naval vessels that can surround Taiwan as well as amphibious assault ships and marines to launch amphibious combat. We have nuclear-powered submarines to cooperate with the rocket force's missiles and prevent external forces' intervention within the First and Second Island Chain. PLA ground forces have deployed rocket artillery which can use massive firepower on Taiwan forces, and trained special forces and helicopter gunships to conduct combat landings. Meanwhile, the rocket force's dominance means if Taiwan troops resisted, most would be wounded or killed by our firepower.More importantly, after reform, the PLA has integrated joint operational capability. Taiwan is no match for the PLA in terms of military weapons and equipment. This is a competition of strengths. We mean to terrify not ordinary Taiwanese, but Taiwan separatists who only bring danger to Taiwan. They try to attract people's attention out of their own self-interest and sacrifice the Taiwanese people's fundamental interests, drawing Taiwan into a quagmire.Once Taiwan witnesses a disaster, the leaders of Taiwan independence forces will face trial according to the Anti-Secession Law. The PLA should regularly conduct military drills to deter Taiwan separatists and have military aircraft and warships routinely cruise around the island. We can also cross the Taiwan Straits middle line and squeeze the space owned by pro-independence forces in Taiwan.An Air Defense Identification Zone could be established in the Taiwan Straits so that every aircraft or warship entering Taiwan must inform and get permission from the Chinese government. The PLA would have the right to conduct countermeasures and safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.We still insist on unifying Taiwan peacefully, but we will never give up the military option. While reunification will lead to peace, Taiwan independence will invite war.The just-concluded PLA military exercises have shown China's determination and capability. They warn external forces and Taiwan separatists that crossing China's red line comes at a real price.The author is vice president of the China Strategy Culture Promotion Association. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	4/24/18	0	0	-0.5423	-1
"US risking Taiwan war: expertsnSino-US relations will hit a dangerous breaking point if Washington stations marines at a new American institute on the island of Taiwan, Chinese observers said on Monday. The new office is scheduled to open in June. Such a move equated to a US endorsement of ""Taiwan independence"" and left Beijing and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) no choice but to resort to non-peaceful means, Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator told the Global Times on Monday. Given that conventionally the US only stations such marines at overseas embassies and consulates, such a decision amounted to ""maximum provocation"" and could plunge the Taiwan Straits to the brink of war, Song said. This was no trade war, he said, which would allow for negotiations. Beijing and the PLA would have to ""ascend to war preparations to resolve the Taiwan question"" regardless of any potential resistance or interference by a US-Japan alliance, Song said. By failing to stick to the principles of the three China-US joint communiques and the one-China policy, the US risked a return to the cold war or even worse, military conflict, Song warned. The decision to station a ""Marine Corps Embassy Security Group"" in the new complex in Taipei was made at the very beginning of the project, Taiwan Focus news website reported Sunday, citing a column by former institute director Stephen Young that appeared in the Taiwan-based Chinese-language Liberty Times. Having Marines stand guard at the facility would be a ""symbolic expression of the US commitment to its friends in Taiwan,"" Young said in a speech at a US policy seminar in the Global Taiwan Institute in Washington DC, Taiwan News reported on February 16. The marine house is not the first US provocation. In March, US President Donald Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act allowing US officials of all levels to travel to Taiwan. Earlier this month, the US State Department approved a marketing license empowering US defense companies to sell submarine-building technology to Taiwan. In May, a US-Taiwan defense industry conference will be held to discuss military cooperation. The rhetoric might have originated with former US officials, rather than current officials, and amount to no more than a Washington bluff, said Liu Weidong, a research fellow at the Institute of American Studies of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. It could be a leak of ongoing discussions at the US State Department, he said, which the Pentagon and President Trump decided to throw out just to test China's reaction. That would be typical of Trump, he noted. "	4/23/18	1	0	-0.9789	-1
"PLA drills in Taiwan Straits send clear warningnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) carried out live-fire drills on Wednesday in the Taiwan Straits. Several types of warplanes participated in the military exercises, including H-6K bombers, Su-30 and J-11 fighter jets. The PLA Air Force announced following the drills that it has sent jets to patrol around the island. The drills and island patrols represent the Chinese mainland's determination and ability to tackle Taiwan independence forces and safeguard cross-Straits relations.The drills came after recent pro-independence activities on the island, especially the high-profile advocacy for independence by the head of Taiwan's administrative authority, Lai Ching-te. Taiwan independence forces are even attempting to organize a ""referendum."" Before the mainland's military drills, Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen watched Taiwanese naval drills simulating an attack on the island on April 13 for the first time since she took office in 2016. She arrived in Swaziland Tuesday for a visit to maintain ties with one of its two African allies.The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council said that it is very dangerous and worthless to harm cross-Straits relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. However, as pro-independence activities on the island have run rampant recently and Taiwanese are seemingly not vigilant against a possible war caused by Taiwan independence forces, the mainland must take firm action to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.Under the overwhelming military pressure posed by the PLA, voices on the island chiding pro-independence forces and activities have increased remarkably. Mainstream media outlets in Taiwan covered the mainland's live-fire drills and commented on the military exercises as a way to deter Taiwan independence forces represented by Lai. The drills not only demonstrate a huge gap between Taiwan and the mainland in military strength, but also show the mainland's resolve and capability to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity.The exercises are also a clear and tough signal to the US that it is damaging cross-Straits ties. Against the backdrop of a pending China-US trade war and China being considered the biggest strategic rival in the US National Security Strategy report published on December 18 last year, the Trump administration is playing the Taiwan card again to make the Chinese government back off.The US and pro-independence forces in Taiwan show no restraint and have been getting closer since Tsai assumed office. US President Donald Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act in March, which allows US officials at all levels to travel to Taiwan. The US State Department approved a marketing license this month that allows US defense companies to sell submarine-building technology to Taiwan. A US-Taiwan defense industry conference will be held in May to discuss military cooperation between the two sides. The American Institute in Taiwan, Taipei Office, will be in service in June. In addition, the Trump administration hasn't criticized or questioned the rampant secessionist moves on the island, sending a wrong signal to pro-independence groups.The Taiwan question is the most sensitive and important core issue in China-US ties. Washington has frequently played the Taiwan card to corner China. After protests lodged by the Chinese Foreign Ministry ended in vain, the PLA must send a message to the US. A military approach is the last and the most effective one. The drills and island patrols come following the mainland's largest-ever maritime military parade in the South China Sea on April 12 to warn Washington that developing US-Taiwan relations won't help Taiwan improve its ability to confront the PLA, or even shake the Chinese government's resolve in safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity. The mainland will instead take tough measures to combat Taiwan independence advocates and promote reunification of the country.Taiwan independence forces' attempt to cozy up to the US and their secessionist activities will only result in strong opposition from the mainland. The Tsai administration should recognize the 1992 Consensus and negotiate with the mainland. US endeavors to play the Taiwan card will only complicate China-US relations and the situation across the Taiwan Straits.The author is an assistant research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	4/22/18	0	0	0.9597	1
"PLA Navy drill sends warning to Taiwan independence forces: expertnA People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy flotilla including the aircraft carrier Liaoning conducted confrontation exercises on Friday in the sea east of the Bashi Strait in the west Pacific, with a military expert saying that the exercises sent a tough message to ""Taiwan independence forces."" Footage recently broadcast on China Central Television (CCTV) showed that the exercises by the PLA Navy formation featured aircraft carrier Liaoning, ship-borne J-15 fighter jets, shipboard helicopters and missile destroyers. The drill aimed to test the formation's operational capability in high seas, Gao Zhaorui, chief of staff of the formation, told CCTV. The Chinese mainland's military drills not only tested and showed the PLA's strength, but also sent a warning to ""Taiwan independence groups,"" Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday. ""An aircraft carrier formation will play an important role in hypothetical future military operations against Taiwan,"" Song said, noting that the formation could form a blockade and conduct military strikes against the island. The location, which was close to the east side of Taiwan, showed that the drills simulated a hypothetical situation in which the Taiwan army retreats to the east of the island. ""The east side of the island, where the Taiwan army elaborately deploys its forces, will not be safe when confronted with the formation of aircraft carriers of the mainland,"" Song said. Real combat exercises in high seas will play a positive role in maintaining regional peace and stability, said Zhu Weiguo, deputy head of the training bureau of the staff of the Chinese navy.

"PLA patrols and drills to continuenThe People's Liberation Army (PLA) will conduct regular and ongoing exercises at the Taiwan Straits, showing Chinese mainland's determination in safeguarding territorial integrity, experts noted on Friday after the PLA Air Force announced that it has sent jets to patrol around the island. Compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits should stand on high alert against ""Taiwan independence"" activities, said Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office on Thursday, the Xinhua News Agency reported. Ma called secessionist activities the biggest threat to peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. ""No individual or element should underestimate our resolve and ability to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Ma said when asked about the recent island patrols by the PLA Air Force. The PLA Air Force recently dispatched several bombers to patrol around the island to practice and upgrade its capability to protect national sovereignty and territorial integrity, according to PLA Air Force spokesperson, Shen Jinke, on the air force's official WeChat account on Thursday. The announcement came after PLA's live-fire military exercises in the Taiwan Straits on Wednesday. ""Taiwan media has been trying to weaken the influence and the scale of the drills in their reports. However, the island patrols are to prove that the PLA's drills are actually targeting 'Taiwan independence,'"" Jin Yi, an expert with the Institute of Taiwan Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times Friday. The drills and island patrols represent the Chinese mainland's determination and ability to tackle ""Taiwan independence"" forces, Jin noted. Several types of warplanes participated in the ""real-time military exercises on the sea,"" including the H-6K bombers, Su-30 fighter jets, J-11 fighter jets, according to the air force report on WeChat. The PLA Air Force has been organizing real-battle drills at sea according to international laws and practices. These drills included flying across the Bashi Channel, Tsushima Strait and Miyako Strait near the island of Taiwan. The Air Force will continue to organize ""island patrols"" using multiple warplanes according to plans that have been made, the PLA Air Force Wechat report said. ""The exercises show that the Chinese mainland is preparing for a future military conflict,"" Jin said, noting that if ""Taiwan independence"" forces take real action or foreign powers intervene, the PLA will be well prepared to repel them. The PLA Air Force on Thursday also released a promotional video of the ""island patrol"" with two versions - in English and in Hakka, the southern Fujian dialect which is widely spoken on the island of Taiwan. ""The Hakka version is targeting residents of the island… it will let them better know the capability of the PLA Air Force,"" Jin noted. "	4/21/18	0	0	0.9766	1

"If Taiwan becomes a chess player, it will be told ‘game over’nThe Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) carried out live-fire drills on Wednesday in the Taiwan Straits, the first of their kind since 2016. The Chinese mainland's Taiwan Affairs Office Director Liu Jieyi said the exercise aimed to ""safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" explicitly targeting Taiwan. Beijing has sent a pointed message to the US that has been recklessly playing the Taiwan card in recent months. Washington has recently stepped up its provocations against Beijing by building its military and security cooperation with Taiwan to the most intimate and dangerous level since 1979. It passed the Taiwan Travel Act that allows reciprocal visits of high-level officials between Taiwan and the US. The US State Department approved a marketing license that allows US defense companies to sell submarine-building technology to Taiwan. US President Donald Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, could visit Taiwan in June when the new American Institute in Taiwan is finished. Taiwan concerns China's core interests, but Washington has been unbridled in infringing upon the one-China policy and emboldened the small group of separatists in Taiwan to turn more aggressive and arrogant in their secession attempts. As trade tensions heighten between China and the US, the Trump administration seems to believe that it has forced Beijing into a corner. But the Trump administration will be disappointed to learn that it is wrong. Beijing has shown no will to back off in trade disputes and, similarly, will stand up against any infringement of the one-China policy. The PLA has an unshakeable determination to safeguard national reunification. Whoever infringes upon the one-China policy and advocates Taiwan independence will invite destruction. And the US is no exception. As Cui Tiankai, Chinese Ambassador to the US, said Tuesday, China will do everything possible to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity if ""someone tries to separate Taiwan from China."" Although peaceful reunification with Taiwan is the optimal choice, in the mainland reunification by force is being seriously considered as an option. It is up to Chinese people to eventually decide when and how Taiwan will be reunified. This depends on how far the Taiwan authorities go along the independence path, not how much the US backs Taiwan. In fact, the more Washington supports Taiwan separatists, the earlier they will see their doomsday coming. Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen said last week that Taiwan is not just the pawn of the US, but can also be a chess player. She may have not figured out how reality works. If Taiwan becomes a chess player, it will be told ""game over"" by the mainland. Hopefully both Washington and Taiwan can understand the warning sent by the mainland's live-fire drills.

"Probes into Chinese steel an ‘exchange’nThe anti-dumping probes launched by Australia and the island of Taiwan into imports from the Chinese mainland might be an ""exchange"" aimed at gaining greater market access in the US, an expert told the Global Times Wednesday.Australia announced anti-dumping and anti-subsidy probes into imports of railway wheels from China on Wednesday, according to a statement released on the website of the Australian Anti-dumping Commission.Earlier on Monday, Taiwan launched anti-dumping and anti-subsidy probes into imports of steel products from the Chinese mainland, according to a statement from the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) on Wednesday.MOFCOM did not respond to requests for comment from the Global Times by press time.""Previously, friction regarding steel products mainly happened between China and the US. The US has tried every possible means to put sanctions on the Chinese steel industry,"" Chen Weidong, an international law professor at the Beijing-based University of International Business and Economics, told the Global Times on Wednesday.However, the moves by Australia and the island of Taiwan might be an action in exchange for greater access to the US market, Chen said, as they were not excluded from the Section 232 investigation initiated by US president Donald Trump.Chen noted that China should be prepared for a collective move taken by the US and its ""allies"" in the future.Also on Tuesday, the US Department of Commerce launched anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into steel wheel products from China.The US said in a statement it sent to the WTO on Tuesday (US time) that it is ready to confer with officials from China on a mutually convenient date for consultations over tariffs on ""approximately $50 billion of the value of China's imports from the US in 2017.""""China has prepared multi-level response plans and backup policies for the US-initiated trade frictions,"" Yan Pengcheng, spokesperson for the National Development and Reform Commission , said Wednesday.

"PLA's live-fire drills in Taiwan Straits a warning to ‘independence groups,’ USnThe People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted live-fire military exercises in the Taiwan Straits on Wednesday, with experts saying that the exercises are a clear and tough signal to ""Taiwan independence groups"" and the US who are damaging cross-Straits ties. Chinese mainland's Fujian Maritime Safety Administration (MSA) issued a notice on April 12, stating that the PLA's live-fire drills in the Taiwan Straits were from 8:00 am to midnight on Wednesday, and that civilian vessels were forbidden from entering the relevant waters. Mainland's military drills not only send a tough message to ""Taiwan independence groups"" but also deliver a warning to the US, which recently boosted communication and ties with Taiwan, Yu Keli, director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Taiwan Studies, told the Global Times on Wednesday. The duration and location, which was relatively closer to Fujian Province than Taiwan, and scale of the drills were limited, according to information released by the Fujian MSA, so it shows that the mainland doesn't want to create too much tension to cross-Straits relations, Yu noted. Cui Tiankai, Chinese ambassador to the US, said that the message delivered by the military exercises is clear: ""China will firmly safeguard its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and will realize reunification."" ""We still hope we can realize it peacefully, but if anyone tries to separate Taiwan, we will do everything we can to safeguard our national sovereignty and territorial integrity."" Cui made the remarks at an event at Harvard University's Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies on Tuesday, the China Review News Agency reported. The US has already made a mistake by legalizing official exchanges with Taiwan, and if it keeps making more mistakes to harm China's sovereignty, the possibility of more military drills and diplomatic retaliation cannot be ruled out, Xu Guangyu, a retired major general of the People's Liberation Army and senior adviser to the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told the Global Times. Not just a deterrent The drills follow recent pro-independence activities on the island, especially the high-profile advocacy for independence by the head of Taiwan's administrative authority, Lai Ching-te. Liu Jieyi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said on Monday that Lai is a ""Taiwan independence separatist,"" and ""the drills are meant to safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Taiwan-based media chinatimes.com reported. If the mainland wants to effectively deter ""Taiwan independence separatist forces,"" the drills should include ""amphibious landings, island seizing, air domination and island blockade combat,"" said Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator. But this time, since the drill area is not big with a shorter duration, the drills could not include too many areas of training. So, aside from live-fire drills by artillery units, the drills might also include logistical preparations for landing combat, said a military expert from a Beijing-based military academy. ""The military drills are not just meant to deter, so areas like combat preparation and logistics affairs were also included,"" he said. ""This means the PLA is preparing for a massive military operation to re-take Taiwan in the future. If Taiwan and the US merely treat the PLA's action as a sign of deterrence, they are making a serious mistake."" Taiwan also conducted military exercises on Friday, and Taiwan's regional leader Tsai Ing-wen watched the exercises. Reuters reported that Taiwan's drills did not involve live-fire exercises. Xu said Taiwan's military exercises are meaningless because there is no chance for Taiwan's military to change anything once the mainland decides to solve the Taiwan question militarily. The PLA did not release updated information on its drills on Wednesday as of press time. "	4/18/18	0	0	0.8166	1

"Drills to deter ‘Taiwan independence’ forces, a warning to USnLive-fire military drills scheduled in the Taiwan Straits on Wednesday will serve as a strong deterrence to ""Taiwan independence"" forces as well as a warning to the US and Japan not to intervene in China's internal affairs, analysts said. No vessels are allowed in the waters when the drills take place from 8:00 am until midnight on Wednesday, the Fujian Maritime Safety Administration announced on its website. The drills come following the country's largest-ever maritime military parade in the South China Sea on Thursday. It is a warning to the US and Japan who try to intervene and thwart China in dealing with the Taiwan question. China's military capability and confidence over the Taiwan question cannot be underestimated, said Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator. The drills will mainly be participated by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy. The mission will likely focus on amphibious attacks, controlling the skies and command of the sea, as well as precision strikes on key targets, Song said. The drills in the Taiwan Straits are expected to be larger than before, as the US and pro-independence forces in Taiwan show no restraint and have been getting closer after Tsai Ing-wen assumed office, Song added. US President Donald Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act in March, which allows US officials at all levels to travel to Taiwan. Tsai left for Swaziland on Tuesday, a day before the military drills in the Taiwan Straits, Reuters reported. Tsai won't stay at home and wait to be warned by the military drills, Yang Lixian, vice secretary-general of the National Society of Taiwan Studies, told the Global Times. ""Since Tsai attaches great importance to its 'diplomatic ties,' the number of which is declining, she won't risk losing any of them,"" Yang explained. The drills are directly targeted at ""Taiwan independence."" But it's not a turning point of the mainland's policy toward the island, Yang said. ""China insists on working on the Taiwan question along both lines. The mainland reacts tough to Taiwan separatist forces, but for the Taiwan people, the mainland treats them like family members by offering preferential policies."" Tsai presided over military drills of the island's navy on Friday, which marks the first time since she took office in 2016, Reuters reported. ""No matter how Taiwan's military reacts, it would be in vain. The island's defense capabilities are far lower than that of the mainland. When Taiwan tries to 'preserve itself' by throwing it into the arms of the US, it is more likely to be discarded,"" Song added. "	4/17/18	0	0	-0.6591	-1
"Trump’s ill-advised fraternization of TaiwannIllustration: Liu Rui/GT The US recently ratcheted up relations with Taiwan. US President Donald Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act into law in the middle of March which allows all levels of US officials to travel to Taiwan. On March 23, Alex Wong, deputy assistant secretary at the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs from the US Department of State, wrapped up his visit to Taiwan, during which he reaffirmed long-standing US policy toward and support for Taiwan. On April 7, the US State Department approved granting a marketing license that allows US manufacturers to sell submarine technology to Taiwan. Taiwan authorities claimed that the decision would help lift Taiwan's defense capabilities. The Taiwan question has been the most important and the most sensitive issue in China-US relations. Do all these moves adopted by the Trump administration amount to playing the Taiwan card against China? The acceleration of US-Taiwan relations did not start with Trump's term. During the administration of Barack Obama, conservative forces within the Republicans were dissatisfied with its Taiwan policy and some pro-Taiwan congressmen were trying to upgrade US-Taiwan relations both militarily and ""diplomatically."" For instance, the US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs held two hearings on ""Why Taiwan Matters"" during the Obama era. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who chaired the committee, denounced calls to stop selling weapons to Taiwan and demanded upgraded relations with Taiwan. In December 2016, some congressmen again forcefully incorporated their ideas into the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 that the Pentagon should push forward exchanges with Taiwan involving senior military officers and senior officials so as to improve military relations and defense cooperation with Taiwan. When I visited the Capitol at the end of 2016, some China hands told me worryingly that the assistants to congressmen with a clear understanding of the importance of Sino-US relations who stuck to the one-China policy were leaving, while there were more with little knowledge of the trajectory of Sino-US relations and the one-China policy. Quite a number of assistants to congressmen have been influenced by pro-Taiwan lobbying groups. Meanwhile, within the US there have been growing concerns about the rise of China. Consequently, voices that support US-Taiwan ties have strengthened within the US congress. Against such a backdrop, since Trump took power, the moves adopted by his administration have been startling. Right after his presidential victory, Trump had a conversation over the phone with Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen. While the phone call was strongly opposed, Trump said he did not understand why the US had to be bound by the one-China policy. In June 2017, the Trump administration approved arms sales to Taiwan worth $1.42 billion. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 passed in December requires the secretary of defense to study the feasibility of re-establishing regular ports of call for the US Navy at Kaohsiung or any other suitable port in Taiwan and normalizing the transfer of defense equipment and services to the island. The signing of the Taiwan Travel Act is just a continuation of the moves. The Taiwan policy of the US has always been a part of the country's strategy toward China. The Taiwan authorities are nothing but a pawn of the US. During the Obama era, the previous policy of engaging with China was widely questioned by the US strategic circle. After Trump took power, he labeled China as the country's strategic rival in his National Security Strategy, highlighting competition between Beijing and Washington. At the same time, some conservative strategists are relentlessly advocating their Taiwan agenda. It is worth pointing out that the one-China policy is the political foundation of Sino-US relations. The moves by the Trump administration have challenged the three principles agreed by the two countries for the establishment of diplomatic relations (namely, the US must sever its diplomatic ties with Taiwan, abrogation of the mutual defense treaty between the US and Taiwan and the withdrawal of all US forces from Taiwan). They may even put China-US ties on the edge of a cliff. The Trump administration should think twice before acting.

"Live-fire drills to check ‘Taiwan independence’nThe Chinese mainland is firmly against ""Taiwan independence,"" Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council said on Friday when asked if the planned drill on the Taiwan Straits is targeting ""Taiwan independence."" ""We would like to reaffirm that we have strong determination, confidence and capability to destroy any type of 'Taiwan independence' scheme in order to safeguard the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Ma said. Fujian Maritime Safety Administration announced on Thursday the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) will conduct live-fire drills on the Taiwan Straits on Wednesday. The announcement came after China's Central Military Commission held the country's largest ever maritime military parade in the South China Sea on Thursday, which for the first time featured the country's aircraft carrier strike group and the PLA's most advanced weaponry. ""The drill comes as the Taiwan authority has been obstinately promoting 'Taiwan independence,' especially considering that Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen and the island's administrative head Lai Ching-te keep spreading the idea,"" Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Friday. ""The mainland needs this targeted drill to punish the two,"" Song noted. ""The US has been containing China on the Taiwan question, and 'Taiwan independence' forces have been touching the bottom line of the one-China principle,"" Lü Cuncheng, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said on Friday. Tsai on Friday visited a naval base on the island and viewed a training, Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao reported. A coalition of organizations known as the ""Formosa Alliance"" which has vowed to promote a referendum on a formal declaration of independence, was officially established last week in Taiwan. Lai's recent remarks on independence are dangerous and presumptuous, said Ma from the Taiwan Affairs Office on April 2, the Xinhua News Agency reported. Ma made the comment in response to Lai's remarks advocating ""Taiwan independence."" ""The focus of the upcoming drill will be long-distance attacks and amphibious landing operations, which worries Taiwan the most,"" Song noted, adding that seizing control of the air and simulated attacks on key targets will also be conducted. Using the PLA navy's comprehensive military powers to suppress ""Taiwan independence"" by blockading the entire island is likely the main point of the drill, Song noted. ""The drill is necessary for the development of the military of the Chinese mainland,"" Lü said.

"Drill a warning to secessionist forcesnDrill a warning to secessionist forces The news that the People's Liberation Army will conduct live-fire military exercises in the Taiwan Straits on April 18 has shocked Taiwan. It is a clear warning against recent pro-independence activities on the island, especially head of Taiwan's administrative authority Lai Ching-te's advocacy for independence. The Chinese mainland rarely conducts live-ammunition exercises in the Taiwan Straits, as we relish regional stability and view peace and cooperation as the mainstream of cross-Straits relations. However, the current administration of Taiwan, which still has not recognized the 1992 Consensus, continues with provocations against the one-China principle, thus pushing cross-Straits ties toward derailment. A military exercise is only a mild warning. The mainland will put forward additional countermeasures if Lai continues with his secessionist moves. Cross-Straits peace can only be constructed on the basis of the one-China principle. The Taiwan Straits is narrow and shallow, and Taiwan is close to the mainland, which means its economy won't sustain any deterioration of cross-Straits ties. The people in Taiwan will not allow the island's administration to sabotage peace and development and sacrifice their stable life for the extreme pursuit of ""independence."" The mainland's anti-independence resolve is firm, while the Anti-secession Law reflects the will of the entire nation, which means any infringement of the one-China principle will result in a backlash. Secessionists should not fantasize that the US will come to their rescue, even though the US had passed the Taiwan Travel Act. National unity is in the core interest of China, which is determined and capable of shattering any foreign intervention. Once Beijing decides to take action, it won't be stopped by any other force. We believe that if the mainland were to take a military strike against ""Taiwan-independence"" forces, Washington would have no effective means other than protest. The planned military drills will be a reconfirmation of Beijing's bottom line. Let the bombing and shooting drills alert Taiwan, rather than letting them actually occur on the island. The mainland does not wish to end the Taiwan question with a military showdown, however, how the situation develops depends on how much rationality remains in the Taiwan administration. Lai's touting of ""independence"" is not an exercise in freedom of speech. As the second figure of the Taiwan authority, Lai has been poisoning the political atmosphere and reducing the public's vigilance against ""Taiwan independence."" While the Taiwan authority continues toward ""independence,"" the mainland will certainly prepare actions that will bring greater deterrence. "	4/13/18	1	1	0.9397	1
"US’ provocation on Taiwan more dangerous than trade frictions: analystsnWashington's recent provocative moves on Taiwan could endanger China-US relations more severely than trade tariffs if the Trump Administration continues to challenge China's sovereignty over the island, analysts said. Both China's Foreign Ministry and National Defense Ministry responded on Monday to the US State Department's approval of a request by US companies to sell technology to Taiwan for its submarine program, saying that China has firmly and consistently opposed exchanges between US and Taiwan officials and the sale of weapons to Taiwan. Last month Trump signed legislation allowing high-level visits between the US and Taiwan, contravening decades-old agreements known as the three joint communiqués that led to the normalization of relations between China and the US under the one-China policy. ""The one-China policy is the political foundation of China-US relations… We urge the US to abide by the one-China policy and the principles of the three joint communiqués, and stop military exchanges and sale of weapons to Taiwan in an effort to prevent severe damage to Sino-US ties and to the stability of the cross-Straits situation,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang, told a daily briefing on Monday. Trump's pick for his new national security adviser, John Bolton, a hawkish conservative Republican, could visit Taiwan in June to attend the opening of the new American Institute in Taiwan, the Economist reported. If the visit takes place, Bolton will become the most senior US official to visit Taiwan since China and the US established diplomatic ties in 1979, experts said. ""In 2018, the biggest friction between China and the US so far is on trade, but the Taiwan question could be the most dangerous,"" Da Wei, director of the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations' Institute of American Studies, told the Global Times on Monday. The Taiwan question is highly sensitive, and Beijing will make no compromise. If US President Donald Trump keeps using Taiwan to challenge Beijing, there could be intense confrontations, Da noted. The US is now playing the Taiwan card as it has figured out that other ways of pressuring or containing China are useless, said Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at Renmin University of China. The US can no longer scare Beijing militarily or isolate it diplomatically, Jin said, adding that China is capable of imposing tit-for-tat trade limits on the US. Possibility of serious crisis ""Although Washington has not taken real actions yet, the signals it sent so far have been strong enough. And any further provocations would force China to take tough action,"" Xu Guangyu, a retired major general of the People's Liberation Army and senior adviser to the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told the Global Times on Monday. Diao Daming, an associate professor at the Renmin University of China, noted that China's countermeasures may be similar to those that Beijing used after Washington received Taiwan's then leader Lee Teng-hui's visit in 1995. After Lee's visit in 1995, Beijing recalled its ambassador from Washington, suspended high ranking official exchanges with the US, and launched massive missile tests in the Straits. The possibility of a serious crisis in the Taiwan Straits cannot be ruled out, said Xu. ""At present, China's is much more powerful and capable than then [1995]. The US should carefully think about the risks before making further provocations."" An Gang, a senior research fellow at the Pangoal Institution, a Beijing-based think tank, warned that the definitive outcome could be in store if the US continues to break long-established protocol. Perhaps the US might force China to choose to solve the Taiwan question as soon as possible, he said. "	4/9/18	0	0	-0.9878	-1
"Beijing must make clear bottom line on Taiwan questionnWhen the new American Institute in Taiwan opens, slated for June, John Bolton, US President Donald Trump's pick for his new national security adviser, could visit Taiwan, it has been reported. If so, Bolton will become the most senior US official to visit Taiwan since China and the US established diplomatic ties in 1979. There are also reports that the Trump administration has approved the marketing license required for US manufacturers to sell submarine-building technology to Taiwan. There has not been such a sensitive step since former president George W. Bush approved the sale of eight conventional submarines to Taiwan in 2001. This can easily lead to the assumption that Washington is using Taiwan to create pressure amid trade tensions with Beijing. The US and Taiwan can employ various tactics against Beijing, but as the Chinese mainland is increasingly outmatching Taiwan in strength, it is the call of the mainland as to how the Taiwan question will be finally resolved. The US passing the Taiwan Travel Act into law and secessionists in Taiwan carrying out radical movements are actually examples of anxious reactions to the changing balance of power across the Taiwan Straits. Washington is attempting to show its influence on Taiwan while Taiwan separatists are locked in desperate struggles. While giving more preferential policies to Taiwan, Beijing has more instruments to suppress these separatists even more. As the US and Taiwan become more provocative, scholars in Beijing are pondering and assessing reunification by force. They believe that since the US and Taiwan continue to hit the boundary outlined by the Anti-secession Law and the cost of dealing with Taiwan is rising immensely, a quick solution to the question may be essential. Despite a number of people being against reunification by force, the number that is pro-force and anticipating a cross-Straits war is growing unprecedentedly. So far, cross-Straits relations built on the 1992 Consensus and the one-China policy agreed by China and the US in accordance with the three joint communiqués have been gravely undermined. The situation across the Taiwan Straits is poised for fundamental changes and the mainland has to make major adjustments. Beijing cannot be led by the nose. We have to figure out more fronts to showcase our strength and to be the venue for the battle with Taiwan. Meanwhile, the mainland needs to continue to prepare for a possible military clash across the Straits. A military showdown with Taiwan is becoming more probable and may take place sooner rather than later. Beijing needs to make clear its bottom line and inform Taiwan society of the dangerous acts which may lead to a military showdown, to avoid a war that could break out due to serious misjudgments by the US and Taiwan. Having got the upper hand strategically, the mainland won't lose its head. Only the decisions of the mainland will count in deciding the future cross-Straits situation. "	4/8/18	0	0	-0.1972	-1
"Taiwan vote ‘unrealistic dream’nTaiwan vote ‘unrealistic dream’ ‘Independence’ pushed by old, marginalized generation Experts say that the founding of an organization advocating ""Taiwan independence"" through a referendum is the movement's last struggle. The ""Formosa Alliance,"" a coalition of organizations vowing to promote a referendum on a formal declaration of independence, was officially established Saturday in Kaohsiung city of the island of Taiwan, Taiwan News reported. Kuo Pei-hung, chairman of pro-independence Formosa TV, started the organization together with 150 individuals including former Taiwan leader Chen Shui-bian, who was sentenced in 2013 to 20 years in prison for embezzlement, bribery and money laundering, but was paroled in 2015. Experts from the Chinese mainland and editorials from Taiwan media say that ""Taiwan independence"" could never be realized. ""This group is gradually being marginalized and is out of main stream and many of them are of the older generation,"" Jin Yi, an expert at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy under Social Sciences, told the Global Times. ""The alliance is called 'Formosa,' meaning joyful island, but promoting a referendum on independence would be a disaster for the island,"" according to an editorial in the Taiwan-based CD News on March 1. The CD News editorial said Taiwan independence is an illusion and likened it to taking drugs. ""We only hope most people understand that the referendum on independence is not only an unrealistic dream, but the dream would be a disaster."" The Formosa Alliance somehow could bring pressure to the Tsai Ing-wen government's cross-Straits policy, said Jin. ""But even the Democratic Progressive Party could not make Taiwan independent, let alone a small group,"" said Jin. ""The Communist Party of China, the People's Liberation Army and Chinese people as a whole will not tolerate a repeat of the historic tragedy of a divided country,"" Huang Zhixian, a National People's Congress deputy and president of the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, said during the annual meeting of China's top legislature on March 9. ""The Party and the Chinese mainland government can bust any secessionist moves and will never allow any individual, organization or government to separate any territory from our country at any time and in any form,"" he stressed. ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist forces and their activities are the biggest threat to cross-Straits peace, development and common interests, said An Fengshan, spokesperson of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council in March. ""To live in a harmonious society, enjoy economic prosperity and promote the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations are the common wishes of people on both sides [of the Taiwan Straits],"" An said. The mainland has implemented many preferential policies to Taiwan compatriots, he said. "	4/7/18	0	0	0.9638	1
"Taiwan should actively integrate into the Belt and Road: scholarsnTaiwan should give full play to its advantages and share the dividends of the Belt and Road Initiative, suggested a Taiwan academic Saturday.Taiwan is geographically part of the Maritime Silk Road , said Pang Chien-kuo of Taipei's Chinese Culture University, at a forum in Xiamen University.Taiwan and the mainland have become integrated following years of economic and trade exchanges. Taiwan has comparative advantages in service and financial industries, and international industry transfer experience, Pang said.He encouraged the Taiwan business community to engage in fields they are competitive. The Belt and Road Initiative aims to prioritize people-to-people exchange, capital flow, logistic and information connectivity. Pang described this as ""unprecedented opportunities"" for the medium and small businesses, and the manufacturing industry in Taiwan.Pang said that the mainland has demonstrated its openness towards Taiwan people and businesses by measures promoting cross-Strait economic and cultural cooperation announced in February. Extensive market and growth potential are on the table if Taiwan takes advantage of the new measures.Li Fei, a professor with the Taiwan study institute of Xiamen University, said that Taiwan and the mainland are complementary in some industries. Taiwan has some full-fledged industries and technologies but its market is rather limited. The mainland owns a much larger market and more capital, while some of its industries are yet mature.With the aid of the mainland, Taiwan can further explore the global market, which is of great significance for Taiwan's economy, said Li.

"China prepares aircraft carrier for sea trialnThe pictured is China's first home-built aircraft carrier at a shipyard in Dalian, Northeast China's Liaoning Province on Monday. Photo: IC Full speed All in the name China's first domestically built carrier, known as the Type 001A, is undergoing preparations for its first sea trial, while discussions about its name show that Chinese people hold high expectations of the carrier's ability to resolve the Taiwan question.According to the latest online photos from the Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Company (DSIC) construction site in Liaoning Province, where the carrier was launched and outfitted, the scaffolds on the carrier have been completely removed, and a phased array radar has been installed.""All the equipment and devices on the carrier are in the joint debugging stage, and the main engine has been powered. In 2018, we will present a surprise to the Chinese people,"" DSIC Chairman Liu Zheng said, according to a report on cctv.com, the official website of China Central Television, on March 13.Liu, who is also the general director of construction of the Type 001A and a member of the National People's Congress (NPC), made the comments to cctv.com when he was attending the Two Sessions ""This all proves that the Type 001A is getting ready for its first sea trial, and the exact timing will depend on factors like the weather and sea conditions. April 23 is Navy Day, the founding day of the PLA Navy [April 23 1949], so this might also be taken into consideration,"" Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, told the Global Times on Tuesday.""After the sea trial, which normally takes about 6-12 months, it will be ready for delivery to the PLA Navy, so it's very likely we will see the carrier enlisted by the end of 2018,"" said Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator.The Type 001A was launched in Dalian on April 26 2017, three days after Navy Day, and the outfitting work only took about one year.The speed with which the Type 001A was built was the fastest in the history of aircraft carrier construction, as it only took two years from the laying of the foundation in the shipyard to its launch, and more importantly, everything from the ship's body to its devices is domestically built, Liu said.""The quality of our construction is also world-class. For example, the world-class standard for the flatness of the flight deck is not more than 4 percent, and we made it lower than 3 percent,"" Liu noted.During the Two Sessions, Yuan Maorong, an NPC deputy from Taizhou city, East China's Zhejiang Province, suggested naming the carrier ""Wei Wen"", after a military general from the Three Kingdoms period (AD 184/220-280) who was the first man in history to arrive at Taiwan, according to cctv.com on March 13.Yuan said naming the carrier Wei Wen would show the historical fact of Taiwan being an integral part of China, and push the development of Cross-Straits relations The discussion of how the ship should be named has also been spreading in social media. Many Chinese netizens suggested simply naming the carrier ""Taiwan,"" while others suggested naming it ""Shi Lang"", an admiral who recaptured Taiwan for the Qing Dynasty.""This displays the high expectations among the Chinese people over solving the Taiwan question, because they want the country to use the first domestically built aircraft carrier as a symbol to announce its determination and ability to achieve this aim, and also send a tough warning signal to the secessionists in Taiwan,"" Li noted.However, the carrier is not targeting Taiwan, according to a military expert from a Beijing-based military academy who requested anonymity. He explained that if Beijing decided to use military measures to solve the Taiwan question, the PLA is fully capable of doing so without an aircraft carrier, and Type 001A was made for a greater purpose.""The PLA Navy has regulations for naming large vessels like aircraft carriers, which generally use the names of provinces and municipalities,"" Song said.""Liaoning is primarily a platform for training personnel and collecting data through testing, while Type 001A is China's first carrier made for combat missions, so its name could be more special. It's impossible to name it with a person's name, for only vessels used for scientific research can use a person's name in China,"" said the anonymous military expert. "	3/27/18	0	0	0.9822	1
"Newly passed Taiwan Travel Act stirs up public discussions about unifying by forcen○ After the US signed the new Taiwan Travel Act, China urged the US to abide by the one-China policy. ○ Chinese mainlanders, meanwhile, are calling to unify Taiwan by force. Analysts say such strong voices reflect the Chinese mainland's changing views. ○ If the US were to make any moves, China would respond with counter moves that could deeply impact the West. Mainlanders point to the Kinmen Islands from a beach in Xiamen, Fujian Province.Photo: CFP Following US president Donald Trump's signing of the ""Taiwan Travel Act"" last Friday, Alex Wong, deputy assistant secretary at the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs from the US Department of State, arrived in Taipei Tuesday night for a three-day visit. Chinese leaders have been issuing strong responses by declaring China's stance on the matter. These events have also stirred up calls from the public to unify Taiwan by force, a sentiment that has been increasing in recent years, which reaches a peak every time conflicts happen across the Straits. ""If relations between the US and China's Taiwan are to be upgraded in the future, I think there will be more voices from Chinese mainland on unifying by force,"" noted Zhou Zhihuai, director of the academic board of the Taiwan and East Asia Research Center of Central China Normal University. In Chinese President Xi Jinping's speech at the closing ceremony of the 13th National People's Congress on Tuesday, he vowed to safeguard China's territorial integrity, saying that any actions or tricks to split China are ""doomed to fail."" The Chinese foreign ministry on Wednesday also denounced the Taiwan Travel Act. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said China has lodged a stern representation to the US regarding US officials' visit to Taiwan. She said China urges the US to abide by the one-China policy and the three joint communiqués, to stop any form of official interaction with Taiwan to prevent any serious damage to Sino-US relations and cross-Straits peace and stability. Rising voices for force Among the public, there has been another round of calling for unifying Taiwan by force on forums and social media. One article on WeChat analyzed that ""unification by force is on the way."" The article went on to suggest that mainlanders should prepare to seize this chance and ""show the Taiwanese compatriots what glory it is to be part of the great nation."" ""China and the US are having frictions in trade. The US has the act and sent its official to China's Taiwan. It all seems like the US is actively causing conflicts and China is being passive. On a larger scale, surrounding countries such as India and countries in the South China Sea are challenging China, we need to step up and be more active,"" one netizen wrote on Weibo, commenting on recent events. Others suggested that signing the act is an opportunity for China to start the unification process. On military-themed forums, there has been a resurfacing of posts that analyze Chinese mainland's military prowess and comparison against Taiwan and the US. For many years, Chinese academia and the public alike have debated unifying by force as opposed to a peaceful process. Supporters of force argue that the number of ""independence"" supporters is increasing linearly and more secessionists will rise under the current Taiwanese education. Supporters for a peaceful process mostly argue that war brings heavy casualties for both sides and it would be difficult to rebuild Taiwanese people's faith afterward. However, in recent years, there has been a gradual increase of supporters for force in the public. Angry calls for unification by force soared to a climax in 2016, when Tsai Ing-wen took office in Taiwan and refused to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus, which emphasizes the one-China principle, along with reports of concerns expressed by those inside Taiwan. There are also discussions in the media whether there should be a ""unification schedule,"" setting a definite timeline on related matters. Zhou has advocated such a schedule on multiple occasions. A poll conducted by huanqiu.com in 2016 suggests that 85 percent of respondents are in favor of recovering Taiwan by force, which they believe should be ideally carried out within five years. Such a shift in public attitude is the result of a variety of reasons, the most obvious being a corresponding shift in Taiwanese public's attitude. According to the South China Morning Post, a poll taken last year revealed that three-quarters of people in Taiwan think that the island and the mainland are two separate countries, with only 14 percent believing that they belong to one nation. Zhou told the Global Times that it is understandable that the public has become more inclined to unify Taiwan by force. The Taiwan Travel Act shows that the nature of relations between the US and Taiwan has changed; that it is no longer non-official, which has been hard on the Chinese public. He thinks such interactions encourage the secessionist forces inside Taiwan, which continue to grow. Furthermore, the mainlanders' call for unification by force shows that in recent years the public has gained more confidence in the country's power both militarily and economically. Taiwan was once admired for its economic and political achievements of the past, but over the past decade the island seems to have lost its appeal among mainlanders. Indeed, on Chinese mainland social media there are often jokes about how some Taiwanese media view the mainland. A couple of years ago, a talk show that went viral showed a Taiwanese host saying that mainlanders are so poor they can't even enjoy tea-leaf boiled eggs. Mainland tourists observe Taiwan through a telescope in Xiamen.Photo: CFP Follow-up measures At the same time, voices from Taiwan are concerned about the mainland's reaction to the act, with some concerned about the prospect of unification by force. An editorial published this week in the Taiwan-based China Times expressed that the mainland ""might take a hardline response towards the Taiwan Travel Act. Taiwan shouldn't be overly excited and needs to cautiously solve and balance relations and call for Washington to communicate with Beijing."" Analysts also told media that Taiwan is being used as a ""chessboard piece"" by the US, and that if cross-Straits military conflicts do break out, there's no guarantee of security for Taiwan. On the issue of unification, the Chinese government's attitude has always been to try the best for a peaceful process while remaining determined to not let the island separate from China. Zhou said a peaceful unification is not entirely up to China. If the US keeps meddling in Taiwan affairs and if something happens that in fact violates article 8 of the 2005 Anti-Secession Law, then China will have to fight. Development of such matters depends on the close interactions between Chinese mainland, US and Taiwan. Article 8 of this law states that in the event that the ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist forces should act under any name or by any means to cause the fact of the island's secession from China, or that major incidents entailing the island's secession from China should occur, or that possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted, the state shall employ non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. However, taking Taiwan's public opinion and international pressure into consideration, a military takeover of the island is not an ideal choice for the central government and academia, Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at Renmin University of China, wrote in an opinion piece in 2016. The international community may impose sanctions on the Chinese mainland if the latter retakes Taiwan by force, and the island may also be perplexed by politically chaotic situations in the first few years. This is the cost that the mainland has to pay for a forced reunification. Morality is another significant factor the central government has to take into account. Military actions will upset the compatriots in Taiwan, and this is not what the mainland wants. Meanwhile, China can also take other measures to counteract the issue. ""For example, if the US were to make any moves to elevate its relations with China's Taiwan, the mainland would have no choice but to respond with counter moves that will deeply impact the US,"" Liu Weidong, a research fellow at the Institute of American Studies of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. He believes Beijing will likely stop sending high-ranking officials to Washington and refuse any official exchanges with Washington for a period of time. If any ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist forces perceive the US bill as a pro-independence signal, the Chinese army will resume its military probes circling the island and send more military vessels and airplanes to patrol the Straits, Liu said.

"Experts urge blacklisting of US officials who visit TaiwannBeijing should implement punitive measures to counter government exchanges between Washington and Taipei, such as forbidding senior US officials who visit Taiwan from entering the Chinese mainland, and voting against US-supported resolutions at the UN, analysts said. Alex Wong, deputy assistant secretary at the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs from the US Department of State, arrived in Taipei Tuesday night for a three-day visit. Wong is the first US government official to visit Taiwan following the enactment of the US' Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages high-level exchanges between Washington and Taipei. According to a statement from the American Institute in Taiwan, the organization representing the US government in the absence of formal relations, Wong will ""hold discussions with Taiwan authorities on a wide range of matters important for the US-Taiwan relationship,"" the statement read. Apart from Wong, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu also embarked on a visit to the US last week to deliver a speech at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Despite coming from the Department of State, Wong's government rank is not very high. Exactly how much sway he holds in US' Asia policy development isn't known but his visit to Taiwan has symbolic implications. Taiwan may even view it as a breakthrough,"" Zhang Wensheng, a professor at the Taiwan Research Institute of Xiamen University, told the Global Times. Analysts fear that Wong's visit is part of efforts by Washington and Taipei to pave the way for higher-level meetings. Beijing is also concerned that other countries, such as Japan and European nations, might follow suit and establish high-level official exchanges with Taiwan. ""One of the options is to ban US officials that have visited Taiwan from visiting the Chinese mainland. Beijing can also downgrade official communications with specific US bodies that interact with Taiwan, for example, reducing or suspending interaction with the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs,"" Zhang said. He also noted that Beijing can refuse to cooperate with Washington on certain UN resolutions to send a signal to the world Beijing's attitude on the Taiwan question. As for Taiwan, analysts said the Chinese mainland may move to further isolate Taiwan by establishing ties with Taiwan's few ""diplomatic"" partners. Unspoken redline The Chinese foreign ministry on Wednesday denounced the Taiwan Travel Act. Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said China has lodged a stern representation to the US regarding US officials' visit to Taiwan. She said China urges the US to abide by the one-China policy and the three joint communiqués, stop any form of official interaction with Taiwan to prevent any serious damage to Sino-US relations and cross-Straits peace and stability. ""There have been other visits by US officials to Taiwan in the past. Some were off the record and some took place when cross-Straits relations were better, and Beijing preferred not to embarrass the sitting leader. With Tsai in office, the mainland's patience with official exchanges between the US and Taiwan is particularly thin,"" Zhang said. Relations across the Taiwan Straits sank to a new low after Tsai took office in 2016. Tsai, chairwoman of pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, refuses to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus, which emphasizes the one-China principle. Beijing considers the one-China principle the cornerstone of cross Straits relations. Beijing views visits to Taiwan by a US president, vice president, secretary of state, defense minister and head of the National Security Agency as an unspoken redline, analysts said. ""If Washington allows Tsai to visit the US or allows the defense ministers from both sides to meet in person, current Sino-US relations would be disrupted and another Taiwan Straits crisis may be triggered,"" Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times. In 1995, in response to then Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui's visit to the US, the mainland conducted exercises that included testing missiles in waters surrounding Taiwan and mobilizing forces in East China's Fujian Province, which is located directly across the straits from Taiwan island.

"Taiwan Travel Act to meet countermeasuresnAlex Wong, US deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, arrived in Taipei on Tuesday. He became the first senior US State Department official to visit Taiwan after US President Donald Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act. Some analysts said that with this trip Washington intended to sound out how Beijing would react and there is a possibility that Washington will send higher-ranking officials to Taiwan or invite senior Taiwan officials to visit the US.Washington and Taipei enhanced the level of visiting officials to upset Beijing. This easy trick is supported within the US, but can be troublesome for Beijing to launch a counterattack. Hence this is a trump card for the US.Beijing can downplay the influence of senior US-Taiwan officials' two-way travel since they are largely ceremonial and aimed at enraging the Chinese mainland. But the question is: The trick may go on endlessly until some day a US secretary of state or defense visits Taiwan or same-level Taiwan officials are invited to Washington, or even worse, a meeting of US and Taiwan leaders. Meanwhile, other countries will likely follow suit. To stop them will come at a diplomatic cost.We must strike back against Washington's implementation of the Taiwan Travel Act. First, Beijing should not invite senior officials of the US Department of State and Defense who visit Taiwan, to the mainland during their terms. For instance, Wong should not be invited to the mainland until he no longer occupies the post. Senior Taiwan officials who visit the US and meet publicly with high-level US officials should be treated alike. This won't make the mainland suffer diplomatically. After all, Beijing and Washington have various channels to communicate.Second, China can pressure the US in other areas of bilateral cooperation: for example, the Korean Peninsula issue and Iran nuclear issue. China can also set itself against the US in international organizations such as the UN. In addition, China needs to move fast to establish diplomatic ties with allies of Taiwan to further squeeze the island's space in the international community.The mainland must also prepare itself for a direct military clash in the Taiwan Straits. It needs to make clear that escalation of US-Taiwan official exchanges will bring serious consequences to Taiwan. This newspaper has suggested that the mainland can send military planes and warships across the Taiwan Straits middle line. This can be implemented gradually depending on the cross-Straits situation.Preventing the Taiwan independence movement and promoting unification through peaceful ways can be costly, perhaps costing more than the short-term loss brought about by forceful unification. It's a misunderstanding to think that peaceful unification will be a harmonious and happy process. The Taiwan authority will only turn around when left with no choice. Sticks matter more than flowers on the path to peaceful reunification.In the grand games between China and the US, how we evaluate Sino-US relations should be based on whether the relationship is conducive to China's domestic politics and economic growth. Let's see which side cares more about the face of Sino-US relations: Beijing or the Trump administration. The next presidential election will be staged soon. If the bilateral ties turn into a mess, how will Trump explain it to his constituency? "	3/21/18	0	0	0.5423	1
"US to use Taiwan Travel Act as bargaining chipnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT US President Donald Trump's recent signing of the Taiwan Travel Act has roiled ties and brought a new challenge to Sino-US relations. With tensions escalating between Beijing and Washington in trade, the US move over Taiwan made the situation more complex. Since 1970s, the US has followed the one-China policy, severed diplomatic relations with the island and forbidden high-level official exchanges. However, the new Act ""encourages visits between the US and Taiwan officials at all levels of government"" and permits high-level Taiwanese officials to enter the US under respectful conditions and meet officials, including those from the Departments of State and Defense. The Act sends misleading signals to pro-independence forces on the island. The impact of the Act, to a large extent, will be determined by the following moves by the US administration. Alex Wong, deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, arrived in Taipei Tuesday, becoming the first US official to visit Taiwan since the signing of the Act. It's likely more US officials will visit the island in the future. The Act reveals the growing relationship between the island and the US, and its long-term negative impact on China-US relations cannot be ignored. Taiwan and Washington will have more ""diplomatic"" contacts in the future. Some US strategists suggest supporting the island to participate in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and help Tsai Ing-wen implement the New Southbound Policy to intensify exchanges with Southeast Asia, South Asia and Oceania, reducing Taiwan's economic reliance on the mainland. Recently, the Tsai administration appointed Joseph Wu, well versed in American affairs, as Taiwan's ""foreign minister."" Wu is famous for his hostile stance toward the mainland. The appointment shows Tsai's increasing tilt toward the US. The Act will boost military cooperation between Washington and Taiwan. In recent years, the US has called on the island to increase its military budget to enhance asymmetric warfare capability to confront mainland. Last October, Tsai said that Taiwan would increase future defense spending by at least 2 percent each year. Recently, Washington has sold a number of weapons to Taiwan, including anti-ballistic missiles, anti-aircraft weapons and surveillance radars. The visits of defense officials in the future need to be watched closely. Last November, the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission published the 2017 annual report and urged the government to invite Taiwan to participate, at least as an observer, in US-led bilateral and multilateral military and security-related exercises, including the Rim of the Pacific maritime exercise, Red Flag air-to-air combat training exercises, and Cyber Storm cyber security exercise. Some members of the House of Representatives also introduced the Taiwan Security Act to mandate senior defense and diplomatic exchanges at the levels of flag officer and assistant secretary or above, and re-establish an annual strategic dialogue on arms sales. The Taiwan Travel Act may lead other countries like Japan to follow suit and start official exchanges with the island. A pro-Taiwan group led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, has been studying the possibility of a Japanese version of the Taiwan Relations Act. The Taiwan Travel Act rings alarm bells for Sino-US ties. As the Trump administration deemed China a ""strategic competitor,"" it would use the Taiwan card to bargain with China. Washington worries that Beijing would unite Taiwan by military force. In February, a report titled ""Coping with Surprise in Great Power Conflicts"" by the Center for Strategic and International Studies urged the US to be alert over the possibility of China launching an attack before the island declares independence. The Taiwan question concerns China's core interests and is Beijing's red line. The Chinese mainland has repeated that it would not tolerate ""Taiwan's independence"" and the Trump administration should not underestimate Beijing's determination to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Besides, the Act will not increase security of the island but drag Taiwan into a dilemma between Beijing and Washington. Currently, Tsai's approval rating has continued to decline. If she wants to shift the public focus from her internal failings by following a harsh cross-Straits policy, that will only spell disaster. After all, Taiwan does not have the strength and capability to play games with giants.

"Taiwan Travel Act threatens to throw cross-Straits relations into quagmirenIllustration: Liu Rui/GT US President Donald Trump on Friday signed the Taiwan Travel Act. The bill, which would have gone into effect on Saturday automatically even if Trump had not signed it, allows US officials at all levels to travel to Taiwan and high-level Taiwanese officials to enter the US. It also encourages the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office to ""conduct business"" in the US. The bill has drawn massive attention and was viewed as a major ""diplomatic"" victory by Tsai Ing-wen's administration. As a pro-Taiwan base, the US Congress has played a negative part on the Taiwan question, creating obstacles for peace and stability of cross-Straits relations and hindering efforts to solve the Taiwan question peacefully. The Act was passed both the Senate and the House of Representatives by unanimous consent, showing a strong pro-Taiwan stance. Since Trump became president, the move to end the restriction on official visits between the island and the US has become public. Some pro-Taiwan senators took the opportunity to show their dissatisfaction with Trump's policy toward Taiwan, exerting pressure on the government, and to gain political advantage for reelection in the coming mid-term election. In the Capitol Hill and US political circles, supporting Taiwan is a kind of political correctness. It was widely predicted that Trump would not veto the bill. Therefore that the Act took effect is not a surprise. The pro-Taiwan stance is rooted in the vigilance against China. In the US National Security Strategy, China was deemed a ""strategic competitor"" that challenges US national security. Hence, the US believes it needs to unite all forces that can be united to counter China. Such Cold War mindset brought pro-Taiwan forces to the stage, leading to cementation of the US-Taiwan alliance with an aim to keep Taiwan an instrument in the West Pacific in containing the mainland. In 1979, the Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act as a guide for ties with the island, authorizing the continuation of commercial, cultural and other relations between the people of the US and the island without supporting official exchanges. And the three joint communiqués between Beijing and Washington severed diplomatic relations between the island and the US. In international politics, official exchanges amount to recognizing bilateral sovereignty. In 1995, then-leader of Taiwan Lee Teng-hui's visit to the US triggered the third cross-Straits crisis. Afterward, leaders of Taiwan used the excuse of transit to visit the US and official exchanges were sought for decades by Taiwan authorities. The Act will pave the way for US-Taiwan official exchanges, send misleading signals to Taiwan authorities, encourage pro-independence forces within the island and drag cross-Straits relations into a quagmire. The one-China principle is the political foundation of China-US relations. Beijing firmly opposes all forms of official exchange and military contact between Washington and Taiwan. That the Congress tried to break the US commitment to maintaining unofficial relations with Taiwan by legislation goes against the one-China principle and the three joint communiqués . As some of its clauses are not legally binding, the Act will not significantly dent Sino-US relations. However, the strong pro-Taiwan forces should be noticed. It is possible for Trump to cater to pro-Taiwan forces and use the Taiwan card to bargain with Beijing, bringing an element of uncertainty to Sino-US relations. Recently, over a dozen high-level officials in the Trump administration were replaced, revealing a rise of forces which advocate a tough stance against China. But the US should not abandon the political foundations and consensus of relations with China which have existed for almost 40 years. Peace and stability of cross-Straits relations are in line with the common interests of Beijing and Washington. If the Taiwan question is not dealt with well, it may bring disaster to bilateral relations. Over the last year, the Trump administration has realized how vulnerable and vital the Taiwan question is for Sino-US ties. It should know there is no space to play tricks on the question. China and the US both need to contribute to maintaining the stable relationship and whether the Trump administration implements the Act will be a touchstone of bilateral ties.

"China to respond 'Taiwan Travel Act' with military pressure: expertsnChina will and should take timely countermeasures against the US and all ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist forces through diplomatic and military means if US legislation that encourages high-level contact between the US and the island of Taiwan is implemented, Chinese observers said on Sunday. ""The passing of the act is a serious political provocation, as it has crossed the 'red line' and will thoroughly undermine relations,"" Xu Guangyu, a retired China's People's Liberation Army major general, told the Global Times. The legislation, known as the Taiwan Travel Act, came into effect on Friday when US President Donald Trump signed the bill. On Sunday the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council stated that the island will suffer serious consequences if it attempts to act on the US bill. China said on Saturday that the country ""firmly opposes the US side signing the 'Taiwan Travel Act,'"" while urging ""the US side to correct its mistake, stop pursuing any official ties with Taiwan or improving its current relations with Taiwan in any substantive way, and handle Taiwan-related issues properly and cautiously so as to avoid causing severe damage to China-US relations and cross-Straits peace and stability,"" according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry website. China's Anti-Secession Law provides a series of conditions wherein the Taiwan question is solved through non-peaceful means. If the US were to send any senior officials to Taiwan or make any moves to elevate its relations with the island of Taiwan, China would have no choice but to respond with counter moves that will deeply impact the US, Liu Weidong, a research fellow at the Institute of American Studies of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Time on Sunday. He believes Beijing will likely stop sending high-ranking officials to Washington and refuse any official exchanges with Washington for a period of time. If any ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist forces perceive the US bill as a 'pro-independence' signal, the Chinese army will resume its military probes circling the island and send more military vessels and airplanes to patrol the Straits, Liu said. US President Donald Trump signed the ""Taiwan Travel Act"" on Friday, but it would gone into effect on Saturday morning even if Trump had not signed it, Reuters reported. The bill, which was passed by the US Congress last month, amends US policy to allow visits by officials at all levels. High-level Taiwan officials should be permitted to enter the US to meet US counterparts, said the Reuters report. The legislation follows a number of provocative moves by the US against China. US President Donald Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports and will target the technology and telecommunications sectors, two people who had discussed the issue with the Trump administration said on Tuesday, according to another report of Reuters.

"Net users furious at British Airways over Taiwan categorizationnNet users furious at British Airways over Taiwan categorization British Airways has drawn anger among Chinese citizens after it categorized Taiwan and Hong Kong as independent countries on its website. This comes in contrast to other well-known foreign companies, such as Germany's Mercedes-Benz and Lufthansa, which recently chose to adjust their category of ""Taiwan"" to ""Taiwan, China."" According to the news site guancha.cn citing posts from Facebook, British Airways on March 7 apologized to Taiwan independence separatist forces and altered the category of Taiwan to that of an independent nation. The letter sent by British Airways reads: ""I'm sorry our mistake has caused you to be offended. We've corrected the word on our website in both languages and it now only displays Taiwan."" It is worth mentioning that British Airways listed Gibraltar as ""Gibraltar (UK)"" on its website. The island, however, remains a source of controversy between the UK and Spain. Surprisingly, the airline also listed Hong Kong as an independent country. Separately, on Monday Wu Mingyi's novel The Stolen Bicycle was shortlisted for the UK's Man Booker International Prize. The organizer labeled Wu a writer from ""Taiwan"" rather than ""Taiwan, China."" Wu even expressed his gratitude on Facebook about it. ""Even though I've just been listed in the initial stage, I am honored and my nationality has been labeled as 'Taiwan.'"" Chinese net users expressed their anger online and called for measures to firmly safeguard national sovereignty and not tolerate any intentions to separate the country. ""How can we still believe in such a company?"" wrote Weibo user ""lipman81."" Many have called for a boycott of British Airways. User ""trytoreload-h"" joked, ""Is the British Empire still not willing to give up on China's Hong Kong?"" Previously, Mercedes-Benz also struck a nerve with Chinese consumers by quoting the Dalai Lama in a social media advertisement. The company later deleted the post and apologized.

"Mainland confident in busting Taiwan separatist moves: NPC deputynMainland confident in busting Taiwan separatist moves: NPC deputy The Chinese mainland has the confidence and ability to bust any separatist moves from the ""Taiwan independence"" forces, and people from the island of Taiwan should not be fooled by any separatist ideals, a National People's Congress (NPC) deputy from Taiwan warned on Friday. ""The Communist Party of China, People's Liberation Army and Chinese people as a whole will not tolerate a repeat of the historic tragedy of a divided country,"" Huang Zhixian, an NPC deputy and president of the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, said at a panel discussion on the sidelines of the annual meeting of China's top legislature. ""The Party and government in China have the confidence to bust any separatist moves and will never allow any individual, organization or government to separate any territory from China at any time and in any form,"" he stressed. At the panel discussion, NPC deputies from Taiwan urged the island's authority to take Taiwan people's welfare into consideration and to promote the development of cross-Straits relations, which have been overshadowed since Tsai Ing-wen was elected and refused to recognize the 1992 Consensus, the basis of cross-Straits relations. Development and progress made in the mainland is an opportunity, not a threat, to Taiwan. The mainland sincerely expects to contribute to improving the Taiwan people's well-being, Huang said. It has been the consensus that a better understanding of and interaction with the mainland is positive to Taiwan, Cai Peihui, a Taiwan businessman and deputy head of the Taiwan compatriots federation in Northwest China's Gansu Province, told the press after the discussion. Cai said he expects the Taiwan people, especially the young generation, to be engaged more often in mainland's development. "	3/9/18	0	0	0.9892	1
"China could respond to Taiwan Travel Act with Anti-Secession LawnThe passage of the Taiwan Travel Act severely reverses gears of the stable development of Sino-US relations, a Chinese expert said Thursday, adding that Beijing could counter the irresponsible move with its anti-secession law. The US Senate unanimously passed the bill on Wednesday that encourages visits between officials from the US and the island at all levels, following a similar approval in the House of Representatives in January. Some of the bill's clauses, although not legally binding, seriously violate the one-China principle and the three Sino-US joint communiqués, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a daily news briefing on Thursday. ""China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly against the act and has lodged solemn representations with the US side,"" Hua said. She said the one-China principle is the political foundation of Sino-US ties. ""We urge the United States to adhere to its commitment to the one-China policy and the three Sino-US joint communiqués, stop official contacts with Taiwan, and prudently and properly handle Taiwan-related issues in order to avoid damaging China-US ties,"" Hua stressed. The Chinese mainland resolutely opposes any form of official or military contact between the US and the island of Taiwan, An Fengshan, spokesman for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said Wednesday. The legislation only needs US President Donald Trump's signature to become law. It would be unusual for him to veto a measure that passed unanimously, Reuters reported. The bill, passed just before China's two sessions - the annual meeting of the country's legislators and political advisers - sends a strong unfriendly message, Li Haidong, a professor at China Foreign Affairs University's Institute of International Relations, told the Global Times. ""At such a crucial time for China's political event, the US' irresponsible move increases uncertainty and risks for bilateral ties and reverses the gears of a stable and positive Sino-US relationship,"" Li said. However, if Washington crosses the red line, Beijing will not tolerate moves to damage its core interests and will undoubtedly counter with the Anti-Secession Law, he added. China's Anti-Secession Law provides a series of conditions wherein the Taiwan question is solved through non-peaceful means. Playing the Taiwan card The bill's actual effect on Sino-US relations largely depends on how the US implements the bill - such as whether ""diplomatic"" exchanges would take place between the US and the island, experts said. The bill permits visits to the US from high-level Taiwan officials, including meetings with defense officials, according to the US Congress website. Meetings of defense officials between the US and the island are rare, and the bill's passage would promote the meetings to a ""defense and diplomatic level,"" Da Wei, director of the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations' Institute of American Studies, told the Global Times on Thursday. Some US politicians have become increasingly interested in playing the Taiwan card in dealing with China-US relations, the Xinhua News Agency said on February 9, days after the US House of Representatives passed a bill that would help Taiwan restore observer status in the Geneva-based World Health Organization. Trump's goal is to win over room for the administration's interests amid the adjustment in Sino-US relations, Diao Daming, an associate professor at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times. Signing the bill could help Republicans attract more votes in the mid-term elections, and the status of Republicans is a priority for the Trump administration at this time, Li said. However, vetoing the bill would damage some Republicans' reputation as they will be regarded as failing to safeguard the business interests with Taiwan, experts said. The US move could also result in greater uncertainty in the Asia-Pacific region, with tensions in the Korean Peninsula expected to intensify with upcoming military drills between South Korea and the US, Li said.

"US lawmakers vent anxiety via Taiwan billnThe US Senate on Wednesday passed the Taiwan Travel Act with unanimous consent. As the bill passed the House of Representatives without opposition in January, the legislation only needs President Donald Trump's signature to become law.It's extremely unusual for both houses of Congress to unanimously vote through a bill that would severely jeopardize Sino-US relations. This reflects growing nationalist sentiment in the US in the face of China's rise. Bellicosity has peaked in Congress and legislators approved the bill to vent their anxieties about China.We urge Trump to stay clear-minded, and veto the bill. Although he may face pressure from Congress, standing firm on the one-China policy - the political basis of Sino-US relations - and maintaining the steady development of bilateral ties will earn Trump support during his term in office and aid his re-election campaign.China should rationally analyze the direction of the US' Beijing policy and respond accordingly, based on its capability. This is more feasible than persuading the White House.American elites are apparently more hostile against China, and as a result, the Taiwan question has quickly become a trump card for Washington. But the US is not resolved in taking concrete steps to challenge China's bottom line. It is considering using the Taiwan card to intimidate China so as to disturb the game between China and the US.China cannot always dance to the tune of the US. It should handle its ties with the US based on its own arrangements and hence marginalize the role of the US Congress in the Taiwan question.Economically, Taiwan is highly dependent on the mainland.Militarily, the strength of the People's Liberation Army has fundamentally changed the military and political situation across the Straits.Diplomatically, Taiwan's ""allies"" have established diplomatic ties with the mainland one after another. The US Senate's passage of the bill is of no strategic significance to the cross-Straits situation.The Chinese mainland should push to make sure the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) faces the consequences for upgrading exchanges with the US until it quits the game or when the DPP is deprived of power by the Taiwan vote rs.China shouldn't be led by the nose by American anti-China politicians.Thanks to its rapid growth, the Chinese mainland is now granted unparalleled strategic initiative across the Taiwan Straits. And it cannot possibly be taken away by US lawmakers.Pro-independence forces are a card Washington can play against China. The Chinese mainland can make targeted measures against pro-independence forces in Taiwan.Being used by Washington and getting mired in long-term Washington-mainland hostility is never a good choice for Taiwan, which is something Taiwanese society has the rationality to realize.Blocking the US from passing the Taiwan Travel Act is difficult.

"US’ Taiwan Travel Act challenges Beijing’s red linenIllustration: Liu Rui/GT The US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations last Wednesday passed the Taiwan Travel Act without amendment. The step is another test of the legislation after it was approved by US House of Representatives last month. Once passed by the Senate and signed into law by US President Donald Trump, the bill will have unimaginable consequences. The Taiwan Travel Act encourages high-level visit exchanges between the US and Taiwan, which is a disguised restoration of previous inter-state relations and serious deviation from the one-China policy. US Congress believes that since the Taiwan Relations Act, there has been a lack of effective communication between the US and Taiwan, which hindered the development of ties. Hence, the US thinks the frequency of mutual visits would contribute to better ties. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Beijing and Washington, ""diplomatic ties"" between the US and Taiwan became naturally invalid, but their interaction did not end completely. Because of China's influence and US' respect for the one-China policy, Washington hasn't gone all out with visits between Taiwanese and US officials. If the Taiwan Travel Act is signed into law, it would possibly allow all high-level officials from the two sides to exchange visits, which will mark a radical change in interactions, although the US administrative department may remain restrained during implementation. The Taiwan Travel Act challenges the bottom line of the Sino-US relationship, heavily undermining the one-China policy and the three Sino-US joint communiqués. The Taiwan question constitutes China's core interests and has been a sensitive issue between Beijing and Washington for quite some time. It has been about 40 years since China and the US established diplomatic ties, yet the White House has been playing tricks over the Taiwan question. The US not only sells arms to the island and maintains official contacts with it, but also implements its Taiwan policy as one of its domestic policies, which is interference in China's internal affairs. Washington is doing so because its goal is to contain China. As a crucial pawn in the US' China policy, Taiwan can be used to pressure Beijing. Many previous US administrations had complied with the one-China policy in public but opposed it in private. Nevertheless, it is rare to see a US administration publicly denying the policy. When Trump first assumed office, he tried to make the one-China policy a tradable good between Beijing and Washington, yet after China's objection, Trump said he will support the policy in his first phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. This official statement by the US' top leader is supposed to be a promise between the two countries, but some people in the US won't stop stirring up troubles by piling pressure on China over the Taiwan question. The Taiwan Travel Act as a matter of fact is not a good thing for the island. It actually pushes Taiwan to the forefront of confrontation between Beijing and Washington. The legislation has sent a wrong signal to Taiwan. It made pro-independence forces on the island mistakenly believe that US has abandoned the one-China policy and they may challenge the policy more audaciously. Once they cross the red line of China's Anti-Secession Law, tension and confrontation across the Taiwan Straits will likely surge and the island will lose the chance of benefiting from peaceful cross-Straits ties. The US should stop testing China's determination over the one-China policy. Once the Taiwan Travel Act goes into effect, the foundation of Sino-US relationship will be shaken and damage to the ties will be immeasurable. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. If any US high-level official pays an official visit to Taiwan, Beijing will treat it as severe provocation and adopt all possible countermeasures, including uniting Taiwan by military force.

"Sino-US ties on brink over Taiwan Travel ActnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT The US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on Wednesday passed the Taiwan Travel Act, allowing visits between the island and the US at all levels, including high-ranking officials after the House passed the bill on January 9. The bill will become law after it is passed by the US Senate and signed by the president. In that case, US President Donald Trump's administration will break the US commitment to maintaining unofficial relations with Taiwan, challenging China's red line. It will also undo efforts of former US presidents and experts to balance relations with Chinese mainland and Taiwan as well as regional security. Being capricious and self-negating in diplomacy has become a mark of declining strength of the US. The Taiwan question, which relates to national sovereignty and territorial integrity, concerns China's core interests. Adhering to the one-China policy and the three joint communiqués between Beijing and Washington is the premise and the political foundation for orderly, healthy and stable bilateral relations. Due to a steeper learning curve after taking office, Trump hasn't fully realized what significance the Taiwan question carries for Sino-US ties and international stability, hence failing to deal with it discreetly. The businessman-turned president applied his transactional mind-set in international relations and chose to play the Taiwan card as an easy way to bargain with China. After all, using other issues like trade, the South China Sea and North Korea seems not to be working out well. Meanwhile, some pro-Taiwan hawks around Trump have tried to build up the momentum for Washington to adjust its policy toward Taiwan while right-wing conservative think tanks kept up their lobbying efforts. As a result, the Republican's pro-Taiwan stance, discouraged by the Obama administration, has gained ground. Guided by the ""America First"" doctrine, the Trump administration will probably continue raising the Taiwan question in Sino-US relations. The Taiwan Travel Act is one of the US Congress' portfolio moves to check China. Once the bill becomes law, Washington would intentionally use Taiwan as an instrument against China in its Indo-Pacific strategy and meddle in cross-Straits relations. Besides, the US will also calculate its moves to collect intelligence from the mainland with the help of Taiwan. Given its capability of managing cross-Straits and Sino-US relations, the mainland will not back off over an issue that concerns national dignity. As a result, China and the US may be mired in confrontation. The situation may turn more serious than during former Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui's trip to the US in 1995. However, whether the bill will become law remains uncertain. It is based on the attitude of US administrative departments. Although Trump has repeatedly doubted former US administrations' adherence to the one-China policy and even phoned Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen right after being elected president, his administration has gradually realized that Sino-US relations are more vital than the Taiwan question. The US' continuous bid to balance the role between the mainland and Taiwan will benefit the country and bring it closer to its global strategic goals. It is a better choice than confronting the mainland. Hence, cross-Straits military conflicts or making the Taiwan question a hurdle in Sino-US relations are not in Washington's interests. The bill also faces massive public pressure inside the US. Distinguished American professor Dennis V. Hickey, an expert in cross-Straits relations, is highly disapproving of the act. ""This bill ought to die in the Senate: it is frivolous, unnecessary, and provocative,"" he said. Above all, the bill was passed by the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations probably because senators used it to gain more votes as the US midterm elections are approaching. But Washington needs to keep in mind that if the bill eventually becomes law, the consequences for Sino-US ties, Asia-Pacific region and world peace will be hard to imagine.

"US law will upset one-China principlenThe Taiwan Travel Act, which has been referred to the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, has the potential to upend Sino-US relations and obliterate the one-China principle, which has been the basis for China-US cooperation for decades, Chinese analysts warned. H.R.535 - Taiwan Travel Act, would allow US officials at all levels to visit Taiwan and meet Taiwanese counterparts, and allow high-level Taiwan officials to be received by US officials in the US. The bill, which passed the House of Representatives on January 9, would also ""encourage the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office and any other instrumentality established by Taiwan to conduct business in the United States."" The Taiwan Travel Act is another indication of US efforts to restrain China by attempting to upgrade Taiwan's status among US allies and in international society, Li Haidong, a professor at China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. ""Since Tsai Ing-wen became the leader of Taiwan, the island has been seeking closer political, economic and military ties with the US,"" said Lü Cuncheng, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""The US is also playing a two-faced game by continuing to develop Sino-US tie in the public arena, while privately drawing Taiwan to its side,"" he said. Li believes the US House of Representatives which supported the bill is attempting to legislate restrictions on a US president's ability to make policy and to create barriers to Sino-US ties relating to Taiwan. While there is no guarantee that the Taiwan Travel Act will pass the Senate and go to Trump for his signature, he may attempt to use the bill as leverage in negotiations with China, said Li. Another related bill, H.R. 3320, which passed the House on the same day, directs the US Secretary of State to develop a strategy to restore observer status for Taiwan in the Geneva-based World Health Organization, according to the Xinhua News Agency. Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said that ""the act violates the one-China principle established by 'the three China-US joint communiqués.'"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang urged the US side to adhere to the principles of the one-China principle and the three Sino-US joint communiqués, and not make any official visits or contacts with Taiwan, nor send any wrong message to ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist forces. ""Since China and the US enjoy great shared benefits, the US should avoid creating rifts on the most consensual and basic one-China principle, otherwise Sino-US cooperation in other areas could also be affected,"" Li noted. Low-level visits only For decades communication between the US and Taiwan has only been on an unofficial low-level basis, Lü noted. Since ""diplomatic relations"" between the US and Taiwan ended in 1979, leaders and top officials from diplomatic and defense departments of Taiwan have not been permitted to pay ""official visits"" to Washington, the PLA Daily reported in January. US officials dispatched to Taiwan have been mainly low-level officials representing business or education departments, which are ""not so sensitive,"" the PLA Daily said. "	2/7/18	0	0	0.962	1
"Mainland ready to help after Taiwan quake kills 7, injures 254nMainland ready to help after Taiwan quake kills 7, injures 254 The Chinese mainland is willing to send rescue teams after an earthquake of magnitude 6.5 hit Taiwan late Tuesday, killing seven and injuring 254. More than 200 people have been rescued, but there are still 88 people missing, with most of them trapped in the Yun Men Tusi Ti building in Hualien County, according to the local disaster relief administration. Six tourists from the mainland have been sent to a hospital in Hualien. One of the injured, a woman from east China's Fujian Province, was in critical condition. Zhang Zhijun, head of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, received details about the casualties, property losses and rescue work through a phone call with Fu Kun-Chi, head of Hualien County. Zhang expressed deep sympathy to all the victims and sincere regards to Taiwan compatriots who suffered, saying that people from the mainland were deeply concerned about the earthquake and sympathize with their Taiwan compatriots. ""We hope local people will overcome the difficulties and rebuild their homes at an early date,"" he said. Chen Deming, president of the mainland-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, also said the mainland was willing to assist with the quake relief, including sending rescue teams to the island. ""The mainland is learning about the conditions of mainland tourists, students and spouses living in disaster-hit areas,"" said An Fengshan, the spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council. The All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots also expressed sympathy to residents from the quake-hit areas in a letter, saying Taiwanese living on the mainland are ready to offer as much help as they can. According to the China Earthquake Networks Center (CENC), the earthquake jolted waters near Hualien at 11:50 p.m. Tuesday. The epicenter was monitored at 24.13 degrees north latitude and 121.71 degrees east longitude, with a depth of 11 kilometers. The earthquake was followed by a series of aftershocks including several measuring over magnitude 5. It is the most severe earthquake to hit Hualien in five decades, and 26 aftershocks hit the county as of 9 a.m. Wednesday, according to Fu, the head of Hualien County. In Hualien, four buildings have partially collapsed or tilted, including Marshal Hotel and two residential buildings. The Marshal Hotel has caved in, with its first two floors caving into the ground, according to Taiwan's emergency operation center. The highway from Suao to Hualien was temporarily closed. The earthquake also caused 200 households to lose power and 35,000 households to lose their water supply, the local fire agency said. Since Feb. 4, more than 100 earthquakes have jolted the area. Taiwan's earthquake experts said more quakes might arrive in the coming weeks. "	2/7/18	0	0	-0.9831	-1

"Beijing has duty to make Taiwan abide by UN sanctionsnThree secret deals between Taiwan and North Korea have been exposed in succession recently. A ship leased by a Taiwan fishing magnate, Chen Shih-hsien, was found smuggling oil to North Korea in December. A Taiwan citizen surnamed Chiang was suspected of shipping coal from North Korea to Vietnam in January. Earlier this month, another Taiwan businessman surnamed Chuang was questioned on suspicion of transporting oil in the open seas to a North Korean buyer. When the island was later accused of violating UN sanctions on Pyongyang, Taiwan-independence forces' response was quite naïve. They said Taiwan isn't a member of the UN and shoulders no responsibility to abide by UN resolutions. China is one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council. China has an obligation to strictly enforce UN sanctions against North Korea. Naturally, as a part of China, Taiwan must abide by UN resolutions. This has been made clear in a recent report by independent UN monitors, who claimed they ""investigated cases of ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products in violation [of UN sanctions]... and found that the network behind these vessels is primarily based in Taiwan Province of China."" In other words, if Taiwan refuses to play by the rules, the Chinese mainland should teach it how. Taiwan is a component of China. Beijing has its duty and capability to oversee its behavior on the global arena. If Taiwanese people get into trouble overseas, Chinese embassies and consulates will provide assistance without hesitation. Once the island makes false moves on the international stage, Beijing also has the right to execute its administrative authority against it as it would for any other province of China. More military forces should be deployed from the mainland in relevant waters so as to monitor Taiwan ships and even board and inspect them in crucial areas when necessary. These measures can be made public to all Taiwan shipping companies, which should be required to cooperate. Making excuses by saying it's not a member of the UN is virtually a disguised secessionist activity. Taiwan may well reflect as to why neither Washington nor Tokyo backed the island when it encountered issues with international organizations. Taiwan must understand that hoping to violate international rules by exploiting its geopolitical advantage is pure fantasy. As for its hopes of participating in international affairs, David Tawei Lee, Taiwan's ""foreign minister"" once expressed the plain truth. Without Beijing's approval, it would be very difficult for the island to seek inclusion in international organizations. "	2/6/18	0	0	-0.9247	-1
"The intelligent manufacturing wavenMachines on a production line of a Delta GreenTech (China) Co plant Photo: Courtesy of Delta GreenTech You Wenren, MD of Delta China Photo: Courtesy of Delta China The Chinese mainland, dubbed the world's factory for its labor-intensive manufacturing sector, is striving to reach an upper stage of the industrial chain by implementing a huge upgrading program. This has provided ample opportunities for high-tech companies in Taiwan, which have found the island's market is not big enough to support their ambitions. ""Taiwan is good at designing software for intelligent manufacturing, like developing robot languages, while mainland companies embody stronger expertise in 'hardware' production,"" Huang Kunrong, president of Taiwan-based Suzhou Fast Rich Robot Technology Co, an industrial robot maker, told the Global Times. Data from the Taiwan Affairs Office shows that as of the end of September 2017, the island had invested in 101,000 projects amounting to $66 billion. And currently, Taiwan is the mainland's second-largest investment source. Manufacturing update With government policies including the Made in China 2025 initiative, Taiwan-invested companies operating on the mainland have become motivated to update their traditional human-led manufacturing models. For example, Taiwan-based optoelectronic solutions provider AU Optronics Corp has set up a high-intelligent liquid crystal display plant in Kunshan of East China's Jiangsu Province. In the Kunshan plant's workshops, 98 percent of the equipment is automated with access to the internet, AU Optronics (Kunshan) Co noted in a statement it sent to the Global Times on Friday. It also noted this plant's manufacturing process has a higher level of automation and intelligence compared with AU Optronics' plants in Taiwan or other parts of the Chinese mainland. ""Our clients have quickly developed and launched new products and established flexible production lines. As they grow better, they want us to be better. So we are pushed to upgrade the quality and efficiency of our production via intelligent manufacturing,"" the company noted. You Wenren, managing director of Taiwan-based Delta GreenTech (China) Co, a manufacturer of electronic components and automation equipment, said that the company began efforts in intelligent manufacturing about three years ago. ""In just two years, we reduced the [number of] workers on each of our assembly lines from 50 people to just five,"" You told the Global Times on Wednesday. According to You, upgrading manufacturing has brought benefits to his company, like saving on labor costs, enhancing efficiency and increasing total output value. ""We are not innovating just to answer the government's call; we are doing this to meet the company's needs. Those upgrading efforts are still proceeding,"" he said. AU Optronics (Kunshan) also stressed that encouragement from government policies has caused the increasing emergence of solutions, facilitating the company's intelligent manufacturing plans. ""In the past, we mainly promoted intelligent manufacturing based on internal experiences. Now, we are also actively exploring external application platforms and tools, while making good use of the mainland's technical advantages in areas like internet, big data and artificial intelligence,"" the company noted in its statement. Rising business opportunities The Taiwan-based companies also noted that the rising trend of intelligent manufacturing has also provided many opportunities for their businesses' development. Huang from Suzhou Fast Rich said that as intelligent manufacturing has been rapidly speeding up on the mainland recently, his company in turn has been getting more and more orders from mainland companies for industrial robots. The orders came from various industries, though excluding those from extremely high-tech sectors such as semiconductor makers. ""In Taiwan, the market is relatively small, and there are very few robot companies. On the mainland, however, as nowadays it's harder to get cheap labor, many companies have no choice but to upgrade their production equipment, and that has given chances for companies like us,"" he said. But Huang observed that small domestic manufacturers are still grappling with the traditional model as they cannot afford the initial investment in those facilities. ""Usually, companies need at least 50 million yuan ($7.97 million) in annual revenue to practice intelligent manufacturing,"" he said. You said the proportion of automation equipment sold across Delta China's overall business has been gradually rising in recent years to about 16 percent currently. Interview with You Wenren Q: What pushed your company to transform its production from a traditional model to an intelligent pattern? A: One important reason was that now, people are looking for better living standards and are asking for much higher wages compared with the past, and that has exerted great pressure on manufacturing companies like ours. So even a long time ago, we knew that intelligent manufacturing would be the solution to the problem of rising costs. Also, with intelligent manufacturing, you get enhanced efficiency and more stable quality. I once visited a mainland manufacturing company and saw they were using traditional assembly lines, with many people performing handcraft like tightening screws. When I saw the scene, I asked one of their senior executives how he could be certain that the screw had been really tightened or not. He replied: Good question, I don't know. With intelligent facilities you can monitor the preciseness of the production, and if one tiny thing goes wrong, you can hear the alarm. Q: From your observations, what is the true attitude of mainland manufacturers toward intelligent manufacturing? A: I observe that more than half of the companies I contacted were just passively answering the government's call for manufacturing updates. But what's lucky is that there are also many companies that really want to make this [intelligent manufacturing] happen. They want to consider what their core competitiveness is and what they should change to further enhance their competitiveness. I am happy that now more and more mainland companies are turning to us for help because they really plan to apply intelligent manufacturing to their plants in order to enhance their businesses. Q: How do you evaluate the Chinese mainland's business environment nowadays? A: It has improved a lot in terms of legal norms. In the past, policies were usually not consistent with the changes of local government leadership. This really bothered overseas companies. But now the situation has improved a lot. Also, I feel that overseas and domestic companies are treated almost equally on the mainland. "	2/4/18	0	0	0.9991	1

"Mainland group slams Taiwan’s decision to block cross-Straits flightsnMainland group slams Taiwan’s decision to block cross-Straits flights Chinese mainland airline association on Tuesday condemned Taiwan's block of cross-Straits flights, for it ""harms people's emotions and disturbs flights."" As Spring Festival nears, airline companies have started to arrange flights that can send people back home cross-Straits. However, it is unreasonable for the Taiwan side not to approve flights from Chinese mainland airline companies over safety reasons, said the association, adding that more flights during the Chinese New Year have been a common practice for years, and have never had safety concerns, China Central Television reported Tuesday. This year, mainland airlines have applied to add 614 flights from mainland cities to the island of Taiwan from Feb 2 to March 2, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said on January 19. Taiwan authorities have created obstacles to 176 flights of China Eastern Airlines and Xiamen Airlines because the two companies are using the new flight route M503 and its connecting routes, said the CAAC. The association said that Taiwan is just using M503 as an excuse, and that this move disregards the well-being of people across the Taiwan Straits. China National Radio (CNR) reported an estimated 50,000 travelers will be affected by Taiwan's decision. Li Zhenghong, head of the Shanghai's Taiwan merchant association, said that ""I may as well swim back to Taiwan to celebrate the New Year,"" CNR reported. "	1/30/18	0	0	-0.7506	-1
"Territorial integrity is not a matter of free speechnThe stereotype views the West has held on China seem difficult to change. Didi Kirsten Tatlow, a former correspondent for The New York Times in Beijing, recently wrote in the newspaper that China is meddling in Germany's democracy and challenging free speech and political protests on German soil. One example she cited was an incident in November when China suspended a Sino-German soccer match after a group of spectators displayed Tibet-independence flags and the German side said it could not ban such protests. But what the author failed to understand is that the Tibet question is a matter of Chinese sovereignty; the Tibetan separatists aimed at splitting China and they should not use freedom of speech as an excuse. For a long time, the West has been pointing an accusing finger at China's policies on the Taiwan question and the Tibet question. Western media deliberately muddle the fact that the issue is about sovereignty. In January, China suspended the Chinese language website and app of the Marriott International hotel chain over an online questionnaire that suggested some Chinese regions, such as Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, were separate countries. While the company responded quickly with an apology, the Washington Post called the apology ""pitiful"" and said it is a typical example of ""China's use of economic coercion to curtail freedom of expression."" Such misreading is a tool with which the Western elite engages with China. As prominent China observer Martin Jacques once pointed out, ""The problem we have in the West at the moment, by and large, is the conventional approach that we understand it (China) really in Western terms, using Western ideas."" The West cannot truly understand the concerns of China - even if China has grown to be the world's second largest economy, it still faces the risk of territory being separated. For Western people who want to support Taiwan independence or Tibet independence, they can choose not to deal with China. Ordinary Chinese cannot tolerate two-faced nations. As China gets a greater say and becomes more confident in global affairs, it will not tolerate any moves by the West to infringe upon its sovereignty. China didn't intervene in the internal affairs of Western countries. Rather, it is opposed to Western interference into its own affairs. The Western elite has tried relentlessly to change the system of other countries, sometimes through non-democratic means. If the West continues to see China through rose-colored lens, its future relations with China will be a bumpy road. "	1/28/18	0	0	-0.9639	-1
"Taiwan firms say they would change label on products for mainlandnSome companies in Taiwan confirmed on Wednesday that their partners in the Chinese mainland and other institutions have requested that they change the label regarding the origin of their products to be sold in the mainland, after officials on the island denied any such moves. At least two companies based in Taiwan said they are planning to change the label to ""Taiwan region"" or ""Taiwan region, China"" from earlier versions such as ""Taiwan, China."" Taiwan is an integral part of China. The issue came to light after media reports suggested that some products from the island of Taiwan were seized or even destroyed by the mainland's customs due to the labels. ""A whole shipment of our goods was returned by the mainland's customs because of the label issue. That's a big loss,"" a businessman based in Taipei who owns a major food company told the Global Times on Wednesday. ""We received the notice from our mainland customers yesterday, saying that we have to change the label if we want to sell goods there,"" said the businessman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Another food processing company in Taiwan was also informed by a cross-Straits business group that the label should be changed if the company still wanted to sell products on the mainland, an employee of the company told the Global Times on Wednesday. The employee also requested anonymity and declined to identify the cross-Straits business group. Both companies indicated that they would follow the request and change their labels. The comments came after officials on the island of Taiwan dismissed earlier media reports on the issue and maintained that only goods labeled with ""Made in Taiwan"" or similar labels could be approved to get through Taiwan's customs. But the employee at the food processing company said that ""all companies"" in Taiwan know the new rule and that products with the new label as requested by mainland business partners had no problem passing through Taiwan customs, if they were headed to the mainland. But those headed for other markets are not allowed to have the new label, according to the employee. The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, China's cabinet, has not commented publically on the issue as of Wednesday night. "	1/17/18	0	0	-0.8402	-1

"Delta, Zara, Medtronic apologize for Tibet, Taiwan questionsnThe Chinese Foreign Ministry on Friday urged foreign companies in China to respect China's sovereignty and integrity, and respect the Chinese people's feelings after more firms were reportedly found listing China's Tibet Autonomous Region and Taiwan as ""countries."" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang told the Global Times on Friday, ""I want to emphasize that Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and Tibet are part of China. This is the reality and the international community has reached a consensus on this."" Lu said that China welcomes foreign companies to invest and conduct business in China, but they should respect China's sovereignty and integrity, as well as the Chinese people's feelings and abide by China's laws. ""This is also the basic code for any company doing business in other countries,"" Lu said. Regulators have asked more companies, including Delta Airlines and Zara, to correct content on their websites in which they list Taiwan as a ""country,"" coming a day after Marriott International's website and app in China were shut down for one week for the same reason. China's Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC) released a notice on its website on Friday, saying that ""the administration pays close attention to the incident of Delta Airlines listing China's Tibet Autonomous Region and Taiwan as ""countries"" on its websites. The administration met with the person in charge of Delta, asked the company to conduct an investigation, correct the content, and publicize the results immediately."" CAAC also asked Delta to immediately make a public apology. Meanwhile, it asked all the overseas airlines which operate in China to check the content on their websites and apps, and operate in accordance with China's laws to avoid similar incidents. Shanghai's cyberspace affairs regulator has asked two companies, popular Spanish clothing and accessories retailer Zara and US medical device maker Medtronic, to rectify listing Taiwan as a ""country"" on their websites and publish an apology on their websites before 6 pm on Friday. Zara, Delta and Medtronic released announcements on their websites in late afternoon on Friday, making apologies and promised to check contents on their websites. The Shanghai regulator said in a statement on its website on Friday that cyberspace is not out of the judicial reach, and overseas companies should abide by China's laws and regulations on the internet. ""Shanghai's cyberspace regulator will strengthen efforts to manage illegal content on the internet and welcome the public and netizens to report violations in an effort to maintain a good environment in cyberspace,"" read the statement. The Friday incidents are the latest since global hotel chain Marriott International released its fifth apology early Friday morning for listing Tibet as a ""country"" in a membership email and triggered outrage on Chinese social media. The three companies involved in the Friday incidents were spotted by Chinese netizens, with some saying ""some overseas companies cannot earn money from China and secretly play tricks to harm our national interests."" Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times on Friday that ""foreign enterprises, which overlooked the Taiwan question or purposely listed some regions in China as 'countries' should learn a lesson from the incidents. Chinese netizens have greatly helped in pushing foreign enterprises to apologize for the incidents. And they will pay attention to other similar tricks played by some overseas firms."" The original furor erupted on Tuesday over a questionnaire emailed to Marriott Rewards card members that asked them to identify their ""country"" as the Chinese mainland, Tibet, Macao, Hong Kong or Taiwan, according to a Sina Weibo post by internet user ""zhongjusaodi."" The hotel chain has apologized five times for the incident and its Chinese website and app were asked by Shanghai regulators to be shut down for a week on Thursday. However, some Chinese netizens still urged a boycott of the hotel chain for the Tibet incident on Friday. "	1/12/18	0	0	0.9775	1
"Taiwan Travel Act to jeopardize Taiwan's futurenThe US House of Representatives unanimously passed the Taiwan Travel Act (HR 535) on Tuesday, calling on the White House to ""encourage visits between US and Taiwan officials at all levels of government."" If the act is passed in the Senate and signed by US President Donald Trump into law, it means Taiwan's ""president,"" ""vice president,"" president of the ""Executive Yuan,"" ""foreign minister"" and ""defense minister"" will be able to visit Washington. That will mean a fundamental change in the US' Taiwan policy. After the establishment of Sino-US diplomatic ties in 1979, the White House adopted the Taiwan Relations Act as a legal basis for their relationship, but forbade high-level exchanges. The Taiwan Travel Act has a long way to go before developing into a law. But the House move, unimaginable in the past, signaled a change in attitude within the US toward China. Many forces in the US are attempting to flare up the Taiwan question once again and use it as leverage against China. Peter Chen, president of the Formosan Association for Public Affairs, a US-based ""pro-Taiwan independence"" organization, said it was ""good to see that the vilified three communiqués are more and more relegated to the ash heap of history - where they belong."" However, the era when the US dominated Taiwan-related affairs has ended. If the country finally passes the Taiwan Travel Act, then the act will be the full stop to that era. The ""pro-independence"" forces in Taiwan may not be as jubilant as their US counterparts because they are clear what risks and challenges they will likely face once the act comes into effect. Back in 1979, the Taiwan Straits were under the sphere of influence of the US Seventh Fleet. The US could intervene in the island's affairs at will. But now 40 years has passed, with the vicissitudes of time. The Chinese mainland has grown to be a major power. We Chinese have gained versatile approaches to the Taiwan question as well as comprehensive advantages of adhering to our bottom line. If the US intends to maintain its remaining influence upon Taiwan, it must coordinate its fundamental stance with that of the Chinese mainland, or it will bog itself down in a very awkward position. There is no need for the US to pass such an act if it wants to effectively control the Taiwan Straits. If Washington ultimately resorts to rolling out the red carpet for the ""Taiwan president"" in the White House to show its will against China, it is taking a huge risk. The mainland will surely act to make sure Taiwan and the US pay the price for their ""high-level exchanges."" The political basis of Sino-US relations will be shaken. Beijing's diplomatic retaliations toward Washington will come from all sides. This will multiply exponentially the costs for the US of handling global affairs and make the country profoundly realize that the Taiwan question is the Chinese mainland's bottom line that it cannot afford to touch. If the act were implemented in Taiwan, it would surely make the mainland more determined to settle the Taiwan question and the cross-Straits situation would enter a new phase. What does it mean ""to settle the Taiwan question?"" One possibility is that the Chinese mainland would comprehensively suppress the pro-independence tendency in Taiwan. Cross-Straits relations would see fundamental changes. The Taiwan public would thoroughly recognize the perils of pro-independence forces and thus expel them from the mainstream political arena. Consensus on the one-China policy would thus be formed in Taiwan that transcends partisan and factional conflicts. Whoever was in office, the Taiwan administration would give up its illusion of taking advantage of exterior forces to keep the mainland in check. Cross-Straits relations would enter a new stage of smooth development and begin the process of peaceful unification. Alternatively, the Chinese mainland's endeavors to settle the Taiwan question would be presumptuously resisted by the Taiwan administration. Taiwan and US political and military forces would join hands. This would prompt the Chinese mainland to take the military approach to reunify Taiwan. The mainland might pay a temporary price for that, but the price would be far less than the accumulated costs of Taiwan and the US challenging the one-China policy. There are signs that Washington has become increasingly rampant on the Taiwan question. The mainland will respond even more strongly. "	1/10/18	1	1	0.9838	1
"Opening new air routes no threat to TaiwannOpening new air routes no threat to Taiwan The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced on Thursday that it is opening four routes over the Taiwan Straits, including the south-to-north M503 route and three connecting regional routes. The mainland's regular arrangement for civil aviation routes has prompted strong reactions from the Taiwan authorities. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council and its defense authority demanded that the mainland close the routes, saying it threatens the island's security. The unreasonable demand will certainly not be accepted by the mainland. The opening of the M503 routes would ease the congestion in the mainland's airspace. The mainland's aviation industry has witnessed spectacular growth in recent years, with flights increasing rapidly and airports being constantly expanded. The Taiwan Straits lie off the southeast coast of the Chinese mainland, and the south and north sides of the area are the most developed regions in the Chinese mainland, with many super cities located along the coastline. It is one of the most reasonable arrangements for civilian flights over the coast. Such an arrangement could greatly ease air congestion and reduce delays. The M503 routes had been planned as early as during the administration of Taiwan's former leader Ma Ying-jeou. Through repeated consultations between the mainland and Taiwan authorities, the mainland had opened the north-to-south route and now announced the opening of the south-to-north route as well as three connecting routes to make the M503 routes fully operational. Taiwan authorities accused the mainland of not negotiating with them before opening the routes. It must be noted that the collapse of communication channels between the mainland and Taiwan resulted from Taiwan authorities' refusal to recognize the 1992 Consensus. Before opening the new routes, the CAAC had informed the relevant departments in Taiwan. If Taiwan authorities desire more consultations, they should ask Tsai Ing-wen, the island's current leader, to change her stance of refusing to recognize the 1992 Consensus that stresses the one-China principle and prompt her to restore communication lines with the mainland. We also cannot help ask, ""How could civilian flights threaten Taiwan's air defense security?"" Such a mentality was caused by the guilt conscience of supporting Taiwan independence. The mainland has always been committed to expanding cross-Straits exchanges and promoting the peaceful reunification of China. There is no need to worry that the mainland would launch a sudden attack on Taiwan by leveraging the new civil aviation routes as long as some forces in Taiwan do not seek to separate the island of Taiwan from China. Besides, if the mainland is determined to solve the Taiwan question by military means, it has the overwhelming military advantage and does not need to wage a sudden attack. If the mainland issues an ultimatum, the island will be thrown into chaos. Taiwan's ""defense"" targeting the mainland has already lost its military relevance and degraded into a political show to trick Taiwan residents. A report by Taiwan-based Central News Agency said an unnamed US State Department official expressed concern on Thursday, saying that they ""oppose unilateral actions by either side to alter the status quo."" Regarding the M503 flight route issue, the official said the US was concerned ""about reports that Beijing has modified the use of civil aviation flight routes in the Taiwan Strait without consultation with Taiwan authorities,"" urging that issues of civil aviation and safety instead be ""decided through dialogue between both sides."" It is obvious that the US State Department is too embarrassed to issue a real-name statement because it cannot find any fault from the mainland. It is the Tsai Ing-wen administration which refuses to recognize the 1992 Consensus and attempts to change the status quo. To open the civil aviation route west of the middle line of the Taiwan Straits is economically relevant and urgent. The mainland does not need to care about the abnormal psyche of Taiwan authorities. It doesn't have to let the airspace over the Taiwan Straits stay idle given its superb natural air route. The earlier Taiwan authorities face the reality and change its stance toward the mainland, the easier it can catch up with the booming development of the surrounding region. "	1/5/18	0	0	0.3523	1

The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) charted direction for pushing forward the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, and advancing the process toward the peaceful reunification of China in the new era, said Zhang, head of the Taiwan Work Office of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, in his New Year message carried by the ""Relations Across Taiwan Straits"" periodical. Zhang said the cross-Strait situation was ""complex and severe"" in 2017. The Democratic Progressive Party administration refused to recognize the 1992 Consensus and impeded cross-Strait exchanges, he said. In 2017, the Chinese mainland rolled out more than 20 policies to provide Taiwanese people who live, work or travel on the mainland with better services, he said. In the new year, he said, the mainland will continue to promote the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and the peaceful reunification of the motherland, boost social and economic integrated development across the Taiwan Strait, and create benefits for cross-Strait compatriots.

"Business as usual for Taiwan companies in Kunshan despite order to suspend productionnEmployees at several subsidiaries of Taiwan-based manufacturers in Kunshan, East China's Jiangsu Province, said that their businesses were operating as usual, at least for now, as the local government delayed an order to some factories to suspend production for environmental reasons. Fast food maker Uni-president China Holdings received a government order to halt production, but the order was temporarily rescinded and business was not affected, company representative Chen Wei told the Global Times on Thursday. An employee from Taiwan-based resistor maker Wangquan Science (Kunshan) Corp, which had also been on the list of companies ordered to halt production by Kunshan local government, said that business was proceeding as usual. ""We are not feeling uneasy about the order,"" the employee said. Electronics maker Foxconn, which has Kunshan subsidiaries, declined to comment when contacted by the Global Times. According to a report on Singapore-based zaobao.com on Wednesday, Kunshan ordered around 270 companies, including Foxconn, to suspend production from December 25 to January 10 to reduce pollution of the Wusong River. About half of these companies are Taiwan-based, but the government has since decided to temporarily postpone the order, the report said. Neither Kunshan government nor the local environmental protection bureau could be reached for comment on Thursday. A representative from a Kunshan subsidiary of Haosheng Fabrics Company, also Taiwan-based, told the Global Times on Thursday that the local government had tightened environmental protection requirements around February 2017, forcing the company to shift its focus from fabric-making to house rentals in September. ""If policies tighten further, we might also have to take some measures,"" Chen said, adding that if production in Kunshan stopped, the company still had product stock in East China's Anhui and Zhejiang provinces. ""We always support government policy,"" he said. The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council noted on Wednesday that the Kunshan production suspension order had not yet been implemented, and hoped that Taiwan-based companies would understand the local government's commitment to combating pollution. Apart from Kunshan, other cities are speeding up efforts to fight pollution. The local government of Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province, also ordered a number of manufacturers to suspend production from Tuesday to Friday, an official from Zhuhai environmental protection bureau told the Global Times on Thursday.

"‘Green terror’ covers TaiwannTaiwanese authorities aim to frighten pro-mainland groups through their doomed to fail the ""green terror"" independence movement, amid growing voices for peaceful unification across the island, said experts after four leaders of Taiwan's pro-mainland New Party members were arrested in Taipei for ""undermining national security."" Wang Ping-chung, spokesman of the New Party in Taiwan and three other young party members were released on Wednesday morning after they were taken away by the police in Taipei on Tuesday. Authorities alleged Wang had violated the ""national security act,"" Taiwan-based China News Agency (CNA) reported. ""The arrest was not due procedure since the four members of the New Party are not civil servants and have no access to confidential information. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is ridiculous to take the action and will lose support among the people,"" Chen I-hsin, a political science professor at Taiwan's Tamkang University, told the Global Times. ""The DPP is pressuring pro-mainland groups and politicians amid growing voices for peaceful unification in recent years, which is exactly what the Tsai Ing-wen administration is fearful of. More people in Taiwan are appreciating the accomplishments made by the Chinese mainland and feel disappointed with Tsai's pro-independence policies,"" Xu Shiquan, former deputy director of the National Society of Taiwan Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times. The DPP has taken actions to promote independence, including claiming in a draft official document that a total of 5,000 ""spies"" are hiding on the island and that organizations and individuals involved should cooperate with investigations, Xu said. Wang told a press conference on Wednesday that the Taiwan authorities' move was ""green terror"" and that he did not receive money from any Chinese mainland's political or military organizations, reported CNA. A bunch of RMB notes were found in Wang's room when authorities searched his home on Tuesday. Green represents Taiwan's current DPP administration and the ruling pro-independence political party. According to Taiwan-based China Times, the four members on Saturday had just returned from a tour of the Chinese mainland. Their journey had been publicly announced and was open to the media. ""The ruling DPP wants to frighten other pro-mainlanders and deliver a message to the public that pro-independence is the only choice. This move is so contradictory because the DPP advocates democracy, freedom and human rights,"" Zhu Songling, a professor at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Beijing Union University, told the Global Times. Zhu said that advocating unification or communism does not go against any laws in Taiwan and the international community has reached consensus that there is only one China. ""Residents in Taiwan need to be alert for any political persecution attempts of the DPP."" The arrest of the four members has attracted attention online in both the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, with many Netizens posting pictures of themselves holding a board with messages showing their opposition to the ""political persecution"" at the hand of Taiwan authorities.

"Japan will reap the whirlwind of its collusion with TaiwannKeisuke Suzuki, member of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said last week in Taiwan that a pro-Taiwan group led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's younger brother Nobuo Kishi was studying the possibility of a Japanese version of the Taiwan Relations Act, according to Taiwan media reports. Suzuki added the work was expected to make progress in a couple of years. ""Legislators"" serving Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) expressed agreement, calling for establishing a legal framework of ""Japan-Taiwan relations"" at an earlier date. Japanese scholars had rolled out the draft of the Japanese version of the Taiwan Relations Act as early as 2005. But uncertain political scenarios in Japan held this draft up until 2012 when Abe was re-elected. In 2013, the Friends of Lee Teng-Hui Association in Japan, set up by Japanese right-wing force and some pro-independence Taiwanese, took the lead in supporting the version. In February 2014, then vice foreign minister Nobuo Kishi proposed the formulation of the Japanese version of the act, bringing the topic to the forefront of politics. In April 2015, then president of the ""Legislative Yuan"" Wang Jin-pyng visited Japan and thanked Kishi for his contribution to advancing the Japanese version of the act. Though it does not take long to enact a bill, the pro-Taiwan force in Japan's LDP chose the current timing to push the act through to gain progress within two or three years. There are two reasons for this: practical concerns and consideration for the future political landscape. Since Tsai Ing-wen came to power as Taiwan's leader in 2016, the DPP has been attempting to challenge cross-Straits relations. Meanwhile, Japan's LDP had its power cemented in the National Diet after the October election, making it easier for them to pass bills. Taiwan will hold elections in 2020, in which Tsai's pro-independence team will likely lose due to its poor political performance over the past years. Hence, if the LDP successfully brings the Japanese version of the Taiwan Relations Act into effect by 2020, it will not only be a ""diplomatic"" achievement of Tsai's team but also a big gift from the LDP to the DPP. Despite the likelihood that the Japanese version of the Taiwan Relations Act will not be finalized, collusion between Abe's cabinet and the DPP has sought to institutionalize and stabilize ""Japan-Taiwan relations."" In October 2015, then chair of the DPP Tsai ""came across"" Abe in Tokyo during her visit to Japan. After she was elected Taiwan's leader in January 2016, the Japanese government and the LDP expressed their congratulations. In March 2017, Jiro Akama, vice minister of internal affairs and communications of Japan, visited Taiwan, becoming the highest-ranking official on a Taiwan trip since the two broke ""diplomatic ties"" in 1972. Tsai also extended her congratulations to Abe when the LDP won the election in October. It is noted that Abe visited Taiwan twice as former prime minister in 2010 and 2011 and held talks with Tsai. Therefore, it is fair to say that the Japanese version of the Taiwan Relations Act is a result of collusion between the Abe administration and Taiwan's DPP. While the deal is not expected to progress in a short term, some of Japan's political forces will probably join hands with the DPP and Taiwan's pro-independence forces to make ""Japan-Taiwan relations"" official. Such collusion has actually existed for a long time. There have been pro-Taiwan forces in Japanese political circles since 1945 when Japan was defeated. Abe's maternal grandfather Nobusuke Kishi and great-uncle Eisaku Sato had been to Taiwan on official visits as former prime ministers before 1972. Therefore, there is a possibility that Abe follows the steps of his forefathers by meddling in cross-Straits relations. Of course, the one-China policy is a universally recognized principle. Anyone who intends to destroy the peaceful reunification of the mainland and Taiwan goes against historical trends and will only end up sowing the wind and reaping the whirlwind.

"India cozies up to Taiwan in foolish movenIndia and Taiwan island signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on December 14 to promote mutual industrial cooperation, an alarming move that could sabotage the recent smoothing of Sino-Indian relations, said Chinese experts on Tuesday. According to a statement in Chinese on Taiwan's ""ministry of foreign affairs"" website on Monday, Taipei Economic Cultural Center in Delhi representative Chung-Kwang Tien and Director General of the India-Taipei Association Sridharan Madhusudhanan signed the MoU to deepen two-way exchanges and cooperation between India and Taiwan. In Chinese, the statement refers that the trade agreement is signed between ""two nations."" Nevertheless, Global Times reporters found that the English version of the statement has not yet been displayed on their website. ""It is a classic move of Tsai Ing-wen and the 'ruling' Democratic Progressive Party, as they constantly tout their dangerous political agenda of 'Taiwan-independence' and are afraid of being exposed and challenged in a bigger context outside the island,"" Hu Shiqing, a researcher at the Taiwan Studies Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. Since Tsai pushed forward the New Southbound Policy in May 2016, five cooperative documents have been signed between the two sides, serving as evidence of the strengthened relations and the potentiality of deepening cooperation in all fields, the statement said. India is Taiwan's 18th largest trading partner, and the total volume of two-way trade exceeded $4.7 billion in the first nine months of 2017, a 40 percent year-on-year increase, according to the statement. India is using the Taiwan question as a bargaining chip in exchange for China's support and concession on its own territorial disputes. It is also possible that India is staying close with Taiwan to serve as a friendly signal toward the US, which just released a new national security strategy branding China as a ""rival power,"" Wang Dehua, head of the Institute for South and Central Asian Studies at the Shanghai Municipal Center for International Studies, told the Global Times. The move is again testing Sino-Indian ties, and is harmful to both sides in the long run. It also came shortly after the Russia-India-China foreign ministerial meeting was held in the Indian capital on December 11, which was believed to have smoothed over Sino-Indian relations after the Doklam standoff between the two sides, Wang said. Qian Feng, a researcher of the Chinese Association for South Asian Studies told the Global Times that as Taiwan has made efforts to strengthen ties with New Delhi over the past years, the South Asian power should be smart and cautious in order to avoid challenging China's bottom line and one-China policy. China does not take such situations related to its core interests lightly, Qian said. "	12/19/17	0	0	0.91	1
"Taiwan authorities arrest pro-mainland New Party leadersnTaiwan authorities arrest pro-mainland New Party leaders Taiwan authorities on Tuesday arrested four leaders of Taiwan's pro-mainland New Party for ""undermining national security"" following their return from a trip to the Chinese mainland. ""The Taiwan authorities have been protecting and spoiling separatists who support 'Taiwan independence,' while using all means to suppress and persecute individuals who support peaceful unification,"" said An Fengshan, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council said on Tuesday. ""We firmly condemn such behavior and will pay close attention to this event,"" An noted. The New Party supports the One-China policy, and opposes ""Taiwan independence"" and has been actively maintaining and promoting cross-Straits relations, to which we give high praise, An said. Wang Ping-chung, spokesman of the New Party in Taiwan and three other young party officials were taken away after the police searched their homes on Tuesday, Taiwan-based China Times reported. According to China Times, the four members on Saturday had just returned from a tour of the Chinese mainland, during which they held discussions with local officials in Beijing, Shanghai and Jiangsu Province. Their journey had been publicly announced and was open to the media. The China Times' report questioned the grounds under which the ""investigation department"" detained the four New Party leaders. According to the report, the authorities allege Wang violated the ""national security act."" When authorities arrived at Wang's home he refused to open the door, forcing authorities to call a locksmith to force the door open. Wang live broadcast the event on Facebook Tuesday Morning. Wang called it ""white terror,"" China Times said. Documents ""resembling account books"" with simplified Chinese characters, common in the mainland, and RMB notes were found in Wang's room, Taiwan's pro-independence SET News Channel reported on Tuesday, adding that it is unknown whether they're relevant to the case. New Party will take measures against the arrest, New Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming told the Global Times on Tuesday, without providing details. Asked whether the arrest was related to the four member's trip to the mainland, Yok said he believes that Taiwan authorities are trying to intimidate his party which is gathering ever greater numbers of followers. Many Taiwan Netizens left comments on Wang's facebook page, to show their dissatisfaction with the Taiwan authorities and in support of Wang.

"Bill allowing US-Taiwan port calls a trick: expertsnA newly-signed defense policy bill, which includes port calls between the US and Taiwan navies, is a trick to increase its bargaining power with the Chinese mainland, Chinese experts said Thursday. US President Donald Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) at the White House on Tuesday and released a statement on the bill that authorizes appropriations for the administration's national security programs for fiscal year 2018, according to the White House official website. Several provisions in the bill call for strengthening of the defense partnership with Taiwan, including recommendations that Taiwan military forces be invited to participate in military exercises, such as the ""Red Flag"" exercises, Taiwan's Central News Agency reported. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said at Thursday's press conference that ""Although the bill which involves Taiwan is not legally binding, it has seriously violated the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiqués. China has lodged solemn representations with the US."" Lu reaffirmed China's opposition to any official exchange and military ties between the US and Taiwan, and he urged the US to deal with Taiwan based on the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiqués to avoid harming Sino-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. ""No US president is crazy enough to turn this into real action, and Trump merely wants to satisfy conservative and hawkish Republicans in Congress,"" said Chu Yin, an associate professor at the University of International Relations. Trump wants to raise his bargaining power on China-US ties. So if China trusts Trump, it can express its opposition, and if China doesn't trust Trump, then it could respond with real actions, such as increasing military pressure on Taiwan or make some adjustments to the Korean Peninsula crisis, Chu added. Domestic affairs An Fengshan, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said at a press conference that the Taiwan question is China's domestic affair. ""Any attempt to undermine the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity is bound to be opposed by the Chinese people and will not succeed,"" An said. It is no surprise that the US is playing tricks on the Taiwan question, because Taiwan is a perfect hand to play when it wants to contain China or make a deal with China, said Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator. If the US sends a military force to Taiwan, it would likely activate Article 8 of China's Anti-Secession Law, which authorizes China to use non-peaceful measures to solve the Taiwan question, Song said. ""Without the Chinese government's permission, foreign forces' activity in Chinese territory, including Taiwan, will be regarded as an invasion or an attempt to separate China, and will force a military response from China. No one should underestimate China's determination and capabilities."" According to the website of the National People's Congress, China's top legislature, Article 8 of the Anti-Secession Law states that ""In the event that 'Taiwan independence' secessionist forces should act under any name or by any means to cause Taiwan's secession from China, or that major incidents entailing Taiwan's secession from China should occur, or that possibilities for a peaceful reunification are completely exhausted, the State shall employ non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.""

"Mainland envoy’s Taiwan ‘unifying’ statement to become official warning: expertsnThe remarks of a senior Chinese diplomat on ""unifying"" Taiwan island by force is expected to be an official warning from the mainland, experts said Sunday, suggesting that the island's media, who appear in shock, should study China's Anti-Secession Law. ""The day that a US Navy vessel arrives in Kaohsiung is the day that our People's Liberation Army unifies Taiwan with military force,"" Li Kexin, the minister at China's Embassy in the US, was quoted as saying at a Friday embassy event in the US, Associated Press reported. Li said he had asked US congressmen whether they are going to send military vessels to Kaohsiung in Taiwan, Taipei Times reported. ""If you send military vessels over there, [you] will activate the Anti-Secession Law [of China],"" Li said. The law stipulates that mainland could take non-peaceful manners to safeguard national sovereignty when the island is, or at the risk of being separated. The remarks have sparked wide attention in the island after local media reported in an exaggerated and panicked tone. Taiwan's ""foreign ministry"" and Mainland Affairs Council protested the remarks, and issued a statement highlighting the island's capability and determination to ""defend itself,"" Taipei Times reported.

"A warning to Taiwan-independence forcesnThe minister at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Li Kexin, said Friday that he had told US lawmakers that the day US Navy vessels arrive in Kaohsiung will be the day the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) unifies Taiwan by force. His remarks have triggered an uproar in Taiwan, with protests from its "" Ministry of Foreign Affairs "" and Mainland Affairs Council.Obviously frightened, the Taiwan authorities' reaction indicates they care about Li's words and lack faith in their invisible movement toward Taiwan's independence.After the US Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 in September, which enables naval vessels of Taiwan and the US to pay mutual visits, Taiwan authorities have been both delighted and dubious about the bill.The island under the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has become deficient of both direction and sense of security.The Chinese mainland has never given up the option of Taiwan reunification by force, which is clear to people across the Taiwan Straits. But Taiwan is not sure what will prompt the PLA's actions while the DPP has been deceiving Taiwanese that the island will stay safe whatever it does.Taiwan knows so little of the mainland's Anti-Secession Law. The DPP is already approaching the boundary of the law and leading Taiwan to a wrong direction. The sustainability of the island's development remains uncertain.Li's words have sent a warning to Taiwan and drew a clear red line. If Taiwan attempts to hold an independence referendum or other activities in pursuit of de jure ""Taiwan independence,"" the PLA will undoubtedly take action.This is the cornerstone of Beijing's policy on Taiwan that can't be shaken and also the will of the entire Chinese nation.It shouldn't be underestimated, otherwise, Taiwan's laissez-faire attitude will allow the DPP to make fatal mistakes.After all, the mainland's determination to prevent Taiwan from gaining independence far outweighs the DPP's and overrides the US' play of the Taiwan card. The mainland has the military strength and strategic will to defy any challenge.Li's words are like warning bells on Taiwan authorities considering independence by a salami-slicing strategy. Taiwan is facing what Peking faced in 1949 - being encircled by mainland forces. Any move that oversteps the boundary will be in vain.The mainland certainly wants a peaceful reunification with Taiwan. But if Taiwan authorities brazenly defy the Anti-Secession Law, using force will be the only choice regardless of cost.Taiwan authorities are playing a ridiculous trick to run counter to the trend of history. They should avoid misjudging the current situation and refrain from making the worst-case scenario happen. "	12/10/17	0	0	0.9344	1

"Mainland law dictates sentence of Lee Ming-chenIllustration: Liu Rui/GT The Intermediate People's Court of Yueyang City, Hunan Province, has sentenced Taiwan rights advocate Lee Ming-che and co-defendant Peng Yuhua to five and seven years' imprisonment respectively, as well as depriving them of their political rights for two years for the crime of subverting State power. Peng and Lee did not appeal the court's verdict.Since Lee comes from Taiwan, the case has been tracked closely by the Taiwan media. The sentencing on Tuesday was open and transparent, with some 30 people present at the hearing, including close relatives of the defendants and media reporters. The declaration of the sentencing was also broadcast live by microblog.Lee was arrested in March this year as he traveled from Macao to the Chinese mainland. It was at this time that mainland authorities made the case public. Following this, Taiwan authorities and some media outlets contrived two plots to discredit the mainland judicial system. One was to bring up the human rights aspect, and the other was to claim that Lee's arrest is just another way for the mainland to put pressure on Taiwan.Before the final sentence was announced on Tuesday, there was still much speculation about the case in Taiwan. From their perspective, whether Lee will be sentenced severely or lightly is a signal that the mainland sends to Taiwan.This speculation is hollow and reflects the distorted mentality of the Taiwan authorities, which are influenced by the strained cross-Straits relationship. All the mainland was doing in this case was undertaking a trial concerned with the subversion of State power according to the law, and it just so happened that one of the defendants was a Taiwan resident. The fact that the defendant comes from Taiwan does not change the trial and the legal basis of the sentencing.Lee's five-year sentence may be a shock to those in Taiwan following the case. Some people who are intent on stirring up conflict between Taiwan and the mainland and compare the two political systems do not think that Lee is guilty. Now they must have realized the legal risks.Regrettably, Taiwan authorities issued a statement immediately after the sentencing, declaring that: ""Spreading ideas of democracy is not a crime"" and that they ""cannot accept"" that the mainland court sentenced Lee, who ""shares the concept of democracy and freedom"" with the charge of ""subverting the State.""Obviously, the Tsai Ing-wen administration in Taiwan is continuing to engage in sensationalist politics. In doing so, their act appears to simply be a way to encourage Taiwan people to engage in illegal activities on the mainland, regardless of the legal implications.Many people in Taiwan think it is reasonable for the court to sentence Lee according to mainland law. They understand that there are differences between the laws on both sides.What the Tsai administration lacks is not intelligence but a responsible attitude toward the well-being of its people. The vision by the Tsai administration fails to see the bigger picture, focusing solely on their own political interests.The spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council has clarified Lee's case many times. The mainland is a society under the rule of law. Those in the mainland must obey local laws and public social order. Those in violation of the law will be punished. We hope that in the future, Taiwan people will not be misguided by the Tsai authorities.The article is a commentary of the Chinese edition of the Global Times Wednesday. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	11/28/17	0	1	-0.9605	-1
"Taiwan resident Lee Ming-che sentenced to 5 years in jail for subversionnTaiwan resident Lee Ming-che sentenced to 5 years in jail for subversion Taiwan resident Lee Ming-che was sentenced to five years in prison for “subverting State power” on Tuesday in a court in Central China’s Hunan Province. Lee, 42, said in the Intermediate People's Court of Yueyang, Hunan Province, that he accepts the verdict and will not appeal. He will be deprived of his political rights for two years. It is extremely rare for a Taiwan resident to be tried in the Chinese mainland for State subversion. Lee’s co-defendant Peng Yuhua, a Chinese mainland resident, was sentenced to seven years in prison under the same charge and deprived of political rights for two years. Peng also accepted the verdict and said he will not appeal. The court said Peng was the ringleader and Lee was an active participant in their attempt to subvert State power, and that evidence was sufficient to prove that their actions constitute a crime. The court also said they granted leniency to both defendants on the grounds that they made honest confessions after arrest and pleaded guilty during the trial. Lee and Peng stood trial in Hunan on September 12. According to the indictment, Peng had set up multiple QQ chat groups starting in 2012 and recruited dozens of people dissatisfied with the Chinese government and the socialist system, including Lee. In one of the QQ chat groups, Peng provided videos and books attacking the Chinese mainland's social system and advocating a Western political system. Peng asked the chat group’s core moderators to study these materials and submit study notes. Lee's notes had attacked the Chinese mainland's current social status and advocated a multi-party rule with rotating leadership, the indictment read. The Taipei Times reported that Lee was an instructor at Wenshan Community College and a former Democratic Progressive Party employee. Taiwan media also said Lee was an NGO worker.

"Taiwan’s millennials hostile to Chinese mainland? Facts say it’s a mythn○ A growing number of Taiwan youth come to the Chinese mainland to study or start up businesses as the mainland offers more favorable policies and better environment ○ Many Taiwan students say they are against Tsai Ing-wen's New Southbound Policy and prefer the mainland policy ○ Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said during his work report to the 19th CPC National Congress that more fair and attractive policies will be issued to people from Taiwan An evening view of Xiamen in Fujian Province Photo: VCG With the sustainable economic growth of the Chinese mainland and disappointing governance within Taiwan, the number of Taiwanese youth who have decided to come to the Chinese mainland for their education or career continues to surge. ""Among the youth of Taiwan, people who acknowledged the Chinese mainland's development are the silent majority. They will not go to the street and shout radical political slogans, but just quietly express their opinions through actions,"" said Zheng Boyu, 31, from Taiwan. Zheng, now based in Beijing, is the manager of Vstartup Station of Taiwan, a subsidiary to Shougang Group, which focuses on helping Taiwanese youth apply to the Chinese mainland universities, obtain internship opportunities here or start up their own business. According to Taiwan media reports along with the results of Taiwan's 2016 elections, on the surface it may seem like many Taiwanese youth are hostile toward the Chinese mainland and support the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). But, as Zheng told the Global Times, ""the facts tell a very different story."" ""One year ago, there was maybe only one call from Taiwan every two or three months asking about applying to mainland universities. But now, I receive several calls every week,"" said Zheng, who claims to have assisted ""thousands"" of Taiwanese youth enroll in schools here or start their own businesses. Due to Taiwan's disappointing economic situation, which the DPP has failed to correct, Zheng told the Global Times that many Taiwanese youth no longer feel that the island can offer them a suitable educational, working or living environment. So they are turning to the Chinese mainland in droves, where education, employment and business opportunities implemented under the policies of the mainland government are far more effective and attractive. A woman stands at a beach along the Taiwan Straits. Photo: VCG Generous scholarships Taiwan's GDP growth (1.8-2 percent) is far slower than most provinces in the mainland (higher than 6-7 percent in average). There are also nine municipalities and provinces in the mainland with higher GDP per capita than all of Taiwan, including Beijing, Shanghai,Guangdong, Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, according to statistics reported by news portal guancha.cn. ""The mainland is now taking a different approach to handle the new DPP administration,"" said Yu Qiang, an associate professor on Taiwan studies at the University of International Relations. ""In short, Beijing is now much tougher about opposing separatist administrations while being much more generous to ordinary Taiwanese people."" ""DPP always tells Taiwanese people that the Chinese mainland is hostile to Taiwan because of 'military deterrence' and diplomatic isolation in the international arena. But it failed to do so when the mainland offers more benefits and conveniences to individuals directly,"" Yu said. A series of attractive new policies issued by the Chinese mainland in 2017 have already started to take effect, including issuing scholarships specifically for Taiwanese students. Luo Dingjun, a PhD student at the School of Policy and Public Management of Tsinghua University, is applying for one of these new ""special scholarships"" issued by China's education ministry and finance ministry in 2017. ""In the past, we needed to compete with students from Hong Kong and Macao who were also applying for mainland-based universities. But now scholarships for Taiwan students are separate, so the competition is only between us, which makes the possibility of winning the scholarship much higher,"" Luo told the Global Times. ""It is very obvious that policies towards Taiwan are getting much more generous,"" Luo said. According to official data from China's finance ministry, the highest scholarship now being offered to Taiwanese students is for PhD students at 30,000 yuan ($4,535) per year; other scholarships for undergraduate and graduate students range from 4,000 to 15,000 yuan. These amounts are much higher than last year. According to 2016 data, the highest scholarship for Taiwanese students issued by the Chinese mainland was only 8000 to 9,000 yuan, and students from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan all had to compete against each other. More popular than the US Top-tier universities in the Chinese mainland including Peking University and Tsinghua University have also become much more attractive to Taiwanese youth than their own local universities. ""As a destination for graduate school, the Chinese mainland is now more popular than the US, due to cheaper tuition, better education quality, no language barriers and a shared culture background,"" Luo told the Global Times. A growing number of Taiwan students with master's degrees from American ""ivy league"" universities have also been applying for PhD studies at Chinese mainland universities. They do so not only for the degree itself, but to build up important social connections within their field, which can better prepare them for a future career in the mainland, according to Zheng. According to the most up-to-date data from Taiwan's own ""ministry of education,"" there are 21,127 students from Taiwan pursuing an education in the US as of April 2017, and 9,642 Taiwanese students studying in Japan. ""In 2016, there were 10,823 students from Taiwan studying in the mainland,"" which is higher than Japan and getting closer to the number in the US, Zhao Lingshan, vice director of the Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan affairs office under China's ministry of education, told Xinhua News Agency in April. ""Taiwanese scholars hired by Chinese mainland universities are also receiving equal treatment. In the past, they were not able to apply to China's National Social Science Fund for their projects, but now this has been changed,"" Luo said. Westbound, not Southbound Apart from the Chinese mainland's increasingly generous policies, another reason cited by many Taiwanese youth for abandoning Taiwan is their growing collective realization that the DPP's anti-mainland policies have been utterly futile. According to a new survey released by a Taiwan-based newspaper, United Daily News, approximately 56 percent are dissatisfied with Taiwan's leader Tsai Ing-wen and her cross-Straits policy. The same survey said that 40 percent hold a positive image of the Chinese mainland, an impressive 5-percent increase from last year and an eight-year peak. More importantly, 40 percent said they were willing to work in the Chinese mainland, a 9-percent increase from last year. Those under 30 years old expressed an even higher willingness to leave Taiwan for the mainland, at 53 percent. Taiwanese parents willing to send their children to the mainland for an education reached an astonishing 38 percent, a 5 percent increase from 2016. ""Hilariously, DPP's poor governance has 'educated' Taiwan's people for us,"" Yu from the University of International Relations laughed. ""After taking office, the DPP ruined the KMT's cross-Straits policy by pushing separatist policies, which in turn received a tougher response from the Chinese mainland. Taiwanese people quickly learned that the DPP's pro-independence stance did nothing to boost their economy, and it even worsened their situation,"" Yu told the Global Times. Tsai's new administration pushed its own economic strategy, called ""the New Southbound Policy,"" which was designed to strengthen the island's trade and economic ties with member countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), New Zealand and Australia. The policy is considered a follow-up to former Taiwanese leader Chen Shui-bian's proposal to reduce Taiwan's reliance on the mainland. ""We totally have no confidence in this policy, because throughout history, Taiwan's southbound strategies have always failed,"" Luo from Tsinghua said. When DPP officials were asked about the details of the New Southbound Policy, they offered no specific plans or policies. ""It was just based on an ideology, and it did not respect any economic principals,"" Zheng said, adding that abandoning the Chinese mainland's huge market was ""not a wise decision at all."" ""Therefore, more Taiwanese youth have been resisting DPP's Southbound Policy and following their own 'Westbound (going to the mainland) Policy,'"" Luo said. Equal treatment Although the Chinese mainland offers an optimal environment for Taiwanese students, both Luo and Zheng told the Global Times that they hope for more equal treatment in the mainland. For instance, the Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan residents (MTP) that they are issued cannot be used as a residents' identity card in the Chinese mainland, which restricts their ability to book hotels, use local banking service, participate in e-commerce or even use ticket machines at local train stations. This has caused some inconvenience to new Taiwanese arrivals, who said that they feel like the mainland still treats them as ""foreign guests rather than family."" Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said at a June press conference that their office was fully aware of the problem with the MTP. ""We are actively researching a solution,"" he said. Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said during his work report to the 19th CPC National Congress that, ""We will ensure that, over time, people from Taiwan will enjoy the same treatment as local people when they pursue their studies, start businesses, seek jobs or live on the mainland, thus improving the well-being of Taiwan compatriots."" ""We will encourage people from both sides to work together to promote Chinese culture and forge closer bonds between them,"" Xi said. For both Luo and Zheng, this was the most impressive part of Xi's report, who hope it can be turned into specific policies as soon as possible. ""It further encourages us to stay in the mainland and help attract more people from Taiwan as well,"" they said. "	11/23/17	0	0	0.9991	1

"Catalonia’s failed secession an ominous forecast for Taiwan’s pro-independence forcesn○ Catalonia's dramatic declaration of independence from Spain caused wriggling among pro-independent forces in Taiwan ○ Pro-independent politicians in Taiwan have been pushing for a similar referendum for independence ○ China's growing influence means international recognition of a one-China principle is expanding Motorcyclists wait at a traffic stop in Taipei. While Taiwan's pro-independence forces feel the influence of Catalonia's pursuit for independence, it is unlikely for them to succeed. Photo: VCG As Catalonia's pursuit for independence from Spain have come to a snap with suppressed protests and a fugitive regional leader, politicians in Taiwan advocating independence from China are feeling the pinch. Chinese scholars specializing in Taiwan research say that what is happening in Spain is just a demonstration of where the pursuit of Taiwan independence will lead, and that the reality Taiwan faces is harsher than that surrounding Catalonia. In a dramatic development of a long-standing secessionist inclination, the Catalonian parliament on October 27 announced independence from Spain after a referendum on October 1, which Madrid declared illegal. About 90 percent of Catalan voters backed independence, though the turnout was only 43 percent. Spain's Constitutional Court then moved to impose direct control of the region and sacked regional president Carles Puigdemont, who then fled to Belgium. Taiwan's pro-independence political forces have been following the Catalan situation closely, making sympathizing remarks and comments, as Catalonia's situation mirrors their own. Taiwan's pro-independence New Power Party, the third biggest holding five of the 113 seats of Taiwan's legislature, posted on Facebook one day after the Catalan referendum in support of Catalonia breaking away from Spain. The party also condemned the Spanish government for ""obstructing the referendum with brutal, violent force,"" and extended their ""greatest honor"" to the Catalan people ""bravely and resolutely expressing themselves."" Pro-independence Taiwan media, including the Liberty Times, also covered Catalonia's events closely. ""But they soon found that things are not what they hoped for,"" said Zhu Songling, a professor with the Beijing Union University Taiwan Research Center. As the situation in Spain fell into a precipitous decline, secessionist Taiwan politicians fell from cheerful to despairing. The central government of Spain moved steadily to thwart any attempts at independence by managing protests in Catalonia with an iron hand and pressing charges against rebellious politicians. More suffocating for Catalan politicians, major Western countries unanimously voiced their support for Madrid. The US State Department said ""Catalonia is an integral part of Spain"" and that the US supports the Spanish government's efforts to seize control of Catalonia. European countries including Britain and Germany also hold the same attitude. The Chinese foreign ministry has expressed its support to the Spanish government in dealing with Catalonia's independence movement, saying it is a domestic issue. This is in line with China's diplomatic policy of non-interference. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and the Taiwan question is China's domestic affair, the Chinese government has always maintained ever since the Kuomintang Nationalist Party of China was defeated in the civil war and fled to the island in 1949. Beijing views Taiwan as a territory waiting to be reunited and created the policy of ""One country, two systems"" to facilitate that goal. Professor Zhu in Beijing said Taiwan should learn from the Catalonia incident that Taiwan independence is unachievable and that any attempt at independence through a referendum is just another dead-end for Taiwan. ""They should wake up,"" he said. Ominous forecast Pro-independence forces in Taiwan have long tried many attempts to pursue independence on legal grounds, including calls for a referendum. It is a means viewed by them to gain legitimacy and win recognition from the international society. The constitution of Taiwan, which represents the ""Republic of China,"" stipulates that the ""country"" is comprised of the Chinese mainland and Taiwan. This is something Taiwan-independence politicians have tried their best to avoid mentioning. Those forces have been actively pushing for Taiwan's status as an ""independent country,"" not including the mainland. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2007 approved a ""normal country resolution,"" in which it calls to ""formulate a new constitution and make Taiwan a sovereign country through referendum at proper time."" In 2016, when the DPP took office, it began to push for an amendment to the ""referendum law,"" trying to substantially lower the bar for a referendum. Taiwan's referendum law requires at least a 50 percent turnout of voters in order for the referendum to be valid. The DPP pushed to allow 18-year-old citizens to vote for the referendum, compared with the original requirement of 20 years or older. It also hoped to change the minimum number of people that can call for a referendum from 90,000 to a mere 2,000. Li Chuanxin, head of Taiwan North, a radical secessionist political organization, wrote in the Liberty Times requesting the subjects of referendum to include those that ""transcend the constitution,"" and calling for hunger strikes to force the DPP to finalize the amendment. Professor Zhu said Taiwan independence will only lead to war. President Xi Jinping has, on different occasions, vowed to rout any possible attempt to separate Chinese territory, backed by the Anti-Secession Law. But pro-independence forces refuse to give up easily. A man holds up a sign in downtown Barcelona to protest the Catalan government's push for secession from the rest of Spain on October 8. Photo: IC Double standards Liang Wen-chieh, a pro-independence Taipei lawmaker and DPP member, wrote that his initial sympathy for Catalonia has turned into disappointment after Catalan leader Puigdemont fled the country. He said that, given the situation, the current administration's policy of ""maintaining the status quo"" or ""pragmatic Taiwan-independence"" is better than Catalonia-like drama, which could lead to bloodshed. Major Western countries unanimously dismissed Catalonia's self-declared independence, which is certainly not good news for Taiwan secessionist forces. As secessionism has grown in a number of Western countries, those governments are on high alert to foil such tendencies, experts say. ""No country would allow any splitting of its territory. A country is not always as united as iron, but why does it have to be separated? If split, its state power will inevitably plummet,"" Yang told the Global Times. But she also said that Western countries may not think the same way for China, even though all countries having diplomatic relations with China must respect the one-China principle. The US apparently heightened its level of communication with Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen during her ""stopover"" in Hawaii on the way to visit Pacific countries. But still, the biggest threat from the US is its arms sales to Taiwan, Yang said. ""The West habitually holds double-standards when it comes to China,"" Zhu said. Experts say China has grown ever more confident in dealing with Taiwan-independent forces, and the recognition of a one-China principle is also expanding as the country's economic and geopolitical clout increases. International society mostly respects the one-China principle and does not view Taiwan as an independent country. Indeed, since the DPP took office in 2016, two more countries have severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in support of the Chinese mainland. This leaves only 20 countries, mostly small in size and economy, to side with Taiwan. Yang said at least six countries are currently reassessing their ties with Taiwan. ""State power is the decisive factor in international politics. We are capable of stripping Taiwan of countries with diplomatic relations. Without anyone's recognition, what kind of country are you?"" Yang said. "	11/9/17	0	0	0.9851	1

"Student slams Taiwan threat to fine those who join CPCnStudent slams Taiwan threat to fine those who join CPC Taiwan's ""Mainland Affairs Council"" announced it would slap a fine of up to NT$500,000 ($16,559) on those who plan to join the Communist Party of China (CPC) after a student from Taiwan showed willingness to join the CPC and he said the move ""threatens Taiwan students studying in the mainland."" Wang Yuqing, a 39-year-old student from Taiwan studying at Peking University, told Hong Kong media that he is planning to join the CPC after the two sessions in 2018. In response, Taiwan's ""Mainland Affairs Council"" announced on Monday that they deem that Taiwan students' joining the CPC violates a regulation in Taiwan, and it will impose fines on such students between NT$100,000 to NT$ 500,000. ""I have looked into documents, and nothing says the Taiwan household status should be withdrawn from those who join the CPC,"" Wang told the Global Times on Monday. ""Taiwan's so-called democracy and freedom would become empty words if the authorities implement such a regulation … They are just trying to threaten us students studying in the mainland to prevent us from joining the CPC,"" Wang said.

"Taiwan Travel Act a dangerous trigger momentnTaiwan Travel Act a dangerous trigger moment The US House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday passed the Taiwan Travel Act, which attempts to remove restrictions on official travel between the US and Taiwan at all levels that have been in place for 39 years. Before the bill becomes law, it must pass the House and Senate and be signed by US President Donald Trump. Observers believe the possibility of the bill becoming law is small but cannot be totally ruled out. Despite having no legal validity, the bill is nothing but a provocation against China's sovereignty, territorial integrity and security interest launched by Taiwan and a few US congressmen. It reflects the complex system of US diplomacy where some politicians play good cops and others play bad. The act might just be a feint or it might also become a real attack. It will not only set back relations between China and the US, but also disastrously overturn cross-Straits relations. The few US congressmen who initiated the bill and the Taiwan side thought they have the leverage to arbitrarily upgrade relations between the US and Taiwan, but they have greatly underestimated the systemic risks that their move may provoke. They perhaps do not know they are pressing a fatally dangerous button. When the US Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs passed the Taiwan Travel Act in June, Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen tweeted her appreciation to US politicians. In response to the latest developments involving the bill, her office spokesman expressed ""official gratitude."" But the island's newly elected executive head Lai Ching-te said in a faux display of modesty that there is still some way to go before the bill is signed into law. The Taiwan question is essentially a question involving the relations between China and the US and the status quo mirrors the balance of military power between China and the US over the Taiwan question. On legal grounds, ""One China"" is widely recognized by the world and previous US administrations accepted it. It would be extremely difficult for the new Washington administration to do otherwise. The US generally has greater military might but Taiwan is closer to the mainland. The mainland's military strength is capable of effectively deterring Taiwan pro-independence forces and the US army in the surrounding area. The US House Foreign Affairs Committee that is pursuing the Taiwan Travel Act is overstepping the red line of China-US relations. If the act is signed into law, it will surely change the cross-Straits atmosphere. For every card the US and Taiwan play according to the act, the mainland will fight back. The Taiwan question is China's core interest and Beijing will not bow to Washington. The Tsai administration thinks the closer the US and Taiwan get, the more secure is Taiwan. This is a total misjudgment by Tsai and Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). China's anti-secession law stipulates a series of conditions where the Taiwan question is solved through non-peaceful means. Once the status quo of cross-Straits relations is overturned, it will massively encourage pro-independence groups in Taiwan and therefore peace across the Straits will be shaken. The DPP administration should not think they will not receive decisive punishment from the mainland regardless of how actively they engage in pro-independence activities and collude with foreign forces. They should not think the mainland will hold back from taking action against Taiwan as long as US military forces are present. The mainland has a lot of leverage and options against pro-independence forces and its willingness to activate these options is far greater than the US' will to stop the mainland. A handful of radical political actors in the US Congress are a common presence in Western institutions. US Congressman Steve Chabot who initiated the act is one of them. He seeks a political presence even at the expense of the US national interest. The understanding of different US administrations on the cross-Straits question over the past four decades is generally rational and pragmatic. We hope this rationality won't be disrupted by the Taiwan Travel Act. China will never use the Taiwan question to cut deals with other countries. China will defend the bottom line of cross-Straits relations at any cost. "	10/14/17	0	1	0.9953	1

"Taiwan leader’s soft words aren’t fooling anyonenIllustration: Liu Rui/GT Taiwan ""president"" Tsai Ing-wen delivered her ""National Day"" address Tuesday. It's jaw-dropping that Tsai spared no word in glossing over her awful political performance yet kept silent about Taiwan's problems and challenges. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration is undoubtedly the world's No.1 in vaunting its alleged achievements.Tsai claimed that there are more than 30,000 ""social housing units"" under construction or planned across Taiwan. This figure is laughable to the Chinese mainland, which completed 36 million units of affordable housing in the last few years and whose population is 60 times that of Taiwan.Tsai elaborated at length on Taiwan's ""democracy and freedom"" and its place in the new international order. Yet these remarks, by implication, are all about how to deal with the mainland. Tsai attempts to use so-called democracy and freedom as a weapon to push for Taiwan independence and expand Taiwan's ""international living space"" to highlight the ""fact"" of Taiwan being an independent sovereign country and realize the sustainability of the Taiwan independence campaign.Tsai has put great efforts in her use of words. Taiwan is depicted in her speech as the most democratic, free, united and strongest ""country"" with greatest achievements in the world.Tsai's speech again evaded the 1992 Consensus and made no mention of the ""1992 historical fact."" Tsai only reiterated her ""consistent position"" that ""our goodwill will not change, our commitments will not change, we will not revert to the old path of confrontation, and we will not bow to pressure."" Tsai even claimed that the DPP administration has ""exerted maximum goodwill."" Is it goodwill that Lai Ching-te publicly supports Taiwan independence upon being appointed as the island's executive head?Tsai has been challenging the 1992 Consensus and the political status quo of the One China policy, and pushing forward all types of ""implicit"" and ""cultural"" Taiwan independence since assuming office.There's no doubt that tensions are rising across the Straits. No matter what words Tsai tosses about, what she depicted in her speech is completely false or merely delusional. The DPP is pushing cross-Straits relations toward a ""cold peace,"" and Taiwan has overindulged in its self-fabricated world.Tsai should be ashamed of Taiwan's ""diplomacy."" Panama, its only influential ""ally,"" recently announced the severing of diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The World Health Assembly and the International Civil Aviation Organization both shut out Taiwan. How dare Taiwan label itself a ""country"" without UN acknowledgement?The West supported separatist forces in non-Western countries in the past, but the declining economy and politics of the West, as well as rising separatism in Europe, are fundamentally affecting Western countries' attitudes toward separatism. The West firmly opposes Catalan independence and it can be predicted that Taiwan independence forces will receive decreasing support and sympathy from Western countries.The central government is capable of deciding the boundary of its Taiwan policy, regulating the DPP administration and preventing Tsai from crossing the redline. China's Anti-Secession Law is taking effect in Taiwan and Taiwan's reunification is a historic trend. Tsai's efforts will end in failure.The article is an editorial of the Chinese edition of the Global Times Wednesday. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	10/11/17	1	1	0.973	1
"Taiwan resident Lee Ming-che pleads guilty to subversionnTaiwan resident Lee Ming-che pleads guilty to subversion Taiwan resident Lee Ming-che pleaded guilty on Monday at a court in Hunan Province for subversion. Lee, 42, and his co-defendant Peng Yuhua, 37, a Chinese mainland resident, were tried Monday at the Intermediate People's Court of Yueyang, Hunan Province. The hearing was broadcast live on the court's Sina Weibo account. According to the indictment, Peng had set up multiple QQ chat groups since 2012 and recruited dozens of people dissatisfied with the Chinese government and the socialist system, including Lee. In one of the QQ chat groups, Peng provided videos and books attacking Chinese mainland's social system and advocating a Western political system. Peng asked core management staff of the chat group to study these materials and submit study notes. Lee's notes had attacked the Chinese mainland's current social status and advocated a rotating leadership multi-party rule, the indictment read. Lee joined the QQ chat group Liang'an Qianshou, or holding hands across the Straits, in September 2012. He said in court on Monday that he got to know Peng on Sina Weibo after retweeting some posts. Lee said Peng introduced him to the QQ chat group where he later became an active member. Peng also wrote an organization guideline in 2012 for a company called Meihua with the intent to subvert State power and overthrow the basic political system of the country, the indictment said. The indictment added that Lee had given editorial advice on the guideline and provided information on how to register NGOs overseas and contact foreign media. The guideline described a scheme to establish a five-layer national organization, with recruiting a million members across the country by 2017 in mind. Peng and Lee had also organized online and offline activities for chat group members to sensationalize prominent domestic issues, and published articles that defame and attack the government and the current system, the indictment read. Prosecutors believe that Peng and Lee ""severely threatened national security and social stability."" In a written confession shown as evidence in court on Monday, Peng wrote, ""I drafted the Meihua company operation guideline with the intent to unite with other chat group friends who worship democracy and constitutionalism … to change the current social system in China, to change the one-Party rule of the Communist Party of China, and to push for a move toward a multi-party system in China."" Lee admitted in court to writing and disseminating articles on chat groups attacking the Communist Party of China, the government and the system. He admitted to sensationalizing prominent social issues and slandering the Party and the government. Lee also admitted to discussing on the Internet overthrowing State power through violence. He admitted to saying, ""I have never felt the need to reject a violent revolution"" and that ""riots will come sooner or later."" Lee told the court that he's guilty and regrets his behavior. In his final statement in court, Lee said he had a biased opinion of the Chinese mainland and had ignored mainland's law on subversive activities. In a separate written material released in court as evidence, Lee wrote that he wants to contribute to China's unification if he returns to Taiwan. ""Recognizing the 1992 Consensus, cooperating with the Chinese mainland in economics, improving cross-Straits communication … and eventually achieving national unification is the only path for Taiwan's development,"" Lee wrote.

"Taiwan resident tried for subversion in mainlandnA Taiwan resident was tried on Monday in Central China's Hunan Province for ""subverting State power."" Taiwan resident Lee Ming-che, 42, and his co-defendant Peng Yuhua, a Chinese mainland resident, stood trial at the Intermediate People's Court of Yueyang, Hunan Province. The hearing was broadcast live on the court's Sina Weibo account. It is extremely rare for a Taiwan resident to be tried in the Chinese mainland for State subversion. Lee was said to have colluded with mainlanders, established illegal organizations, and plotted and carried out activities to subvert State power, according to An Fengshan, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, in May. Investigators discovered that Lee had frequently entered the mainland since 2012, An said. On March 19, 2017, Lee, who was on the mainland to participate in illegal activities, was put under coercive measures by security authorities in line with the law. He was later arrested by the Hunan provincial security organ. An said Lee and his group had admitted to engaging in activities which threaten national security. Lee's wife and mother arrived on the mainland Sunday to attend the Monday hearing. The Taipei Times reported that Lee is an instructor at Wenshan Community College and a former Democratic Progressive Party employee. Taiwan media also said Lee is an NGO worker.

"Timetable needed for unification of TaiwannIllustration: Liu Rui/GT After I put forward the idea that Beijing should set a timetable for the unification of Taiwan, some Taiwanese scholars believed this symbolized a shift in the mainland's attitude toward the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)'s government. From their point of view, setting a timetable would only make Taiwanese feel antipathy against the central government and deteriorate cross-Straits relations, as polls suggest the majority of Taiwanese people hope to maintain the status quo and only a few of them want unification. Others believe that setting a timetable paves the way for Beijing to introduce a law of unification. Even if the Taiwanese public wants to maintain the status quo, public opinion in the mainland requires national reunification. As far back as the 1980s, former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping raised the question: Are we going to give up reunification if Taiwan authorities refuse to negotiate with us? Does it mean the central government can no longer pursue unification if Taiwan wants to maintain the status quo? Obviously not. The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation pushes us to set a timetable for reunification. Today's China is the closest ever to realizing the great rejuvenation. An increasing number of scholars are starting to explore the relations between the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and national reunification, and have divergent views on whether we should set a timetable and what kind of a timetable is needed. Peter Enav, former Taiwan correspondent for the Associated Press, believes that the mainland will use force to unite Taiwan in 2018, and conditions are increasingly mature for the mainland government to forcefully take over Taiwan. Apparently, this speculation lacks supporting evidence. Some believe that a flexible Taiwan policy is better than setting a timetable. At the beginning of the 21st century, some observers argued that there were no connections between national reunification and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, noting that even in the heyday of the British Empire in the 19th century, the country failed to achieve unification. They argued that despite being haunted by the Northern Ireland problem, the UK is recognized worldwide as a developed country, and Germany, South Korea and other nations realized a peaceful rise after WWII despite unresolved sovereignty issues. But as far as I am concerned, now it is time to set the timetable to reunite Taiwan. Prior to his visit to the US in 1979, when Deng was questioned about whether the mainland had a timetable to solve the Taiwan question by force, he said, ""We try to use peaceful means to bring Taiwan back to the motherland and achieve national unification. The problem is that if we promise that we will not use military forces, it will tie our hands and make the Taiwan authorities refuse to negotiate with us for peaceful reunification. This will in turn lead to the use of military force to solve the problem."" He didn't elaborate on the time frame to reunite Taiwan, as it was obviously immature to set a timetable at that time. About 20 years later, then Chinese leader Jiang Zemin told then visiting US president Bill Clinton that ""the settlement of the Taiwan question should be pursued with a timetable."" This was the first time that the Chinese leadership put forward the concept of a timetable in addressing the Taiwan question. In 2000, the State Council issued a white paper entitled ""the One China Principle and the Taiwan Question,"" systematically and comprehensively elaborating the central government's stance and policies on the One China principle and cross-Straits relations in a governmental document for the first time. ""As the Chinese government has successively resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao, the people of the whole of China are eager to resolve the Taiwan question as early as possible and realize the total reunification of the country. They cannot allow the resolution of the Taiwan question to be postponed indefinitely,"" according to the white paper. Jiang said in his speech for the 50th anniversary of People's Republic of China in 1999 that the complete reunification of the motherland and the maintenance of its security are the very foundation for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the unshakeable will of all the Chinese people. In 2008, then Chinese president Hu Jintao put forward a ""Six-Points"" proposition to Taiwan in his speech commemorating the 30th anniversary of the ""Message to Compatriots in Taiwan,"" and stressed that reunification is at the very core of our efforts to resolve the Taiwan question. Hu said the objective is to safeguard and ensure national sovereignty and territorial integrity, pursue happiness for all Chinese including the compatriots in Taiwan and achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. President Xi Jinping stressed at a ceremony marking the 95th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China that ""advancing the process of China's peaceful reunification, and accomplishing this great cause is a prerequisite for realizing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."" While it was a strategic consideration to put forward the notion of a timetable to address the Taiwan question decades ago, conditions for the mainland to set the timetable are now mature. National reunification is organically connected to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and it is time for us to work out a 30-year timetable. Under the One China principle, the mainland could be patient with Taiwan, but if the DPP government accelerates its provocative activities, the mainland will for sure speed up its efforts to realize the complete unification of China and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

"US legislation on docking warships in Taiwan threatens China ties: expertsnChinese experts warned that a recently passed US legislation on ""normalizing"" US weapons sales to Taiwan and allowing US warships to dock on the island will do no good to both sides, and will bring ""unprecedented"" damage to Sino-US ties and cross-Straits relations. The US House of Representatives Friday passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2018. It also passed amendments to the legislation that allow US navy ships and the island's to dock at each other's territory, and to ""normalize"" the transfer of defense equipment and services to Taiwan, Taiwan-based Central News Agency (CNA) reported Saturday. A final version of the legislation will be drafted at an undisclosed time and will take effect after US President Donald Trump signs it. ""Such a clause seriously violates China's sovereignty,"" Liu Xiangping, head of the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Nanjing University, told the Global Times on Sunday. Experts also warned that the legislation, together with the amendment, will do no good to the interests of the US and the island. Liu noted that Sino-US ties would be seriously damaged if the final version of the legislation is approved, which is possible considering that the initial version was passed by a vote of 344-81. ""Trump is likely to bend to political pressure to avoid internal conflicts, even at the cost of offending China,"" Liu added. However, Lü Cuncheng, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, noted that in consideration of Sino-US ties, the US may not dock its warships in Taiwan ports even if the legislation takes effect. ""If the legislation takes effect, high-level dialogue between China and the US and political mutual trust would be seriously damaged,"" Lü said. Moreover, Lü pointed out that the legislation, if enacted, would threaten cross-Straits relations and severely hurt the interests of Taiwan people. The legislation states that the US should expand military exchanges with the island of Taiwan and encourage the latter to continue investing in its self-defense capabilities. It also calls on the US government to provide defense equipment and services as Taiwan requests, the CAN reported. The NDAA draft was passed by the Senate's Armed Services Committee on June 28, which was strongly opposed by China. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said in June that China had ""lodged solemn representations with the US side over its erroneous actions on Taiwan-related issues."" ""Taiwan-related content in the aforementioned bill severely violates the three joint communiqués between China and the US, and constitutes interference in China's domestic affairs. China by no means accepts that,"" Lu said. "	7/16/17	0	0	-0.9843	-1

"US arms sales to Taiwan is more of a political than military issuenThe Trump administration on Thursday notified the US Congress of its plan to approve the sale of a $1.4 billion arms package to Taiwan. The plan, which requires Congressional approval, would be the first such sale under President Donald Trump The package reportedly includes torpedoes, missiles and early-warning radar support but does not include the F-35 fighters that the island's new administration desires.Arms sales to Taiwan have long been a serious issue in the China-US relationship. Sales of defensive weapons are a key provision of US commitments to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act. Although China has strongly condemned the US whenever such sales were made, the US has gone on its own way under each administration and has even made multiple arms deals with Taiwan during a particular presidential tenure. The scale and quality of arms package the Trump administration has just approved is of a medium level among all deals so far.It must be noted Beijing's diplomatic protest along with some boycott actions have each time yielded noticeable results. Beijing's reaction has no doubt exerted pressure on Washington, which has to be more cautious as it lays out the plan of arms sales to Taiwan. The scale of arms sales to Taiwan normally would not be upgraded significantly under a new administration although a new president is not willing to scale back either. Washington is extremely cautious about whether to sell Taiwan the offensive weapons the island is desperate for. The quality of weapons that the US has sold to Taiwan is lower than that of weapons sold to its other major allies.With the mainland's growing military might, the military strength of the mainland and Taiwan is already out of balance. With only the defense spending of around $10 billion a year, less than one-tenth of the mainland's military expenditure, Taiwan's army has been dwarfed to a level of ""militia"" compared with its mainland's counterpart and has lost the substantial resistance capability. The annual increase of the mainland's military spending is almost equal to the island's total annual military spending. Additionally, the mainland has continuously developed new cutting-edge weapons. As time goes by, it would be increasingly an easy game for the mainland to recover Taiwan by force.In this light, US arms sales to Taiwan is more of a political than a military issue. Arms sales are one of the key elements of Washington's military and political engagement with Taiwan and signals Washington's reiteration of its commitment to protecting Taiwan. It is also a card Washington holds against the mainland. By adjusting the scale and timing of arms sales, Washington tries to send clearer signals to Beijing.Given China has more cards to play against the US and the tussles between China and the US over the arms sales to Taiwan remain locked in stalemate, China's ability to control the situation has gradually increased. In foreseeable future, the US will continue to sell arms to Taiwan, which is a reality Beijing has to face up to.What Beijing needs to prevent most is the possible sale of F-35 fighters to Taiwan. In 1992, the US agreed to sell 150 units of advanced F-16 fighters at the time to the island, which prompted Beijing to stage a rare protest against Washington. That batch of F-16 fighters is now outdated and possessing F-35 fighters may add fuel to ""Taiwan independence"" activities.To what extent will the new arms deal under the Trump administration impact the China-US relationship? This may not be a proper question to ask. The China-US relationship involves different individual cases and the case regarding arms sales to Taiwan is no doubt at the forefront of these multiple cases and a miniature of their bilateral relationship.China must voice necessary reactions and should not fear whether such reactions may undermine its ties with the US. What China needs to consider is what new cards the US may hold and play against China and how capably China can maneuver the mutual retaliations amid its tussle with the US.China's relationship with the US is different from that with other countries. The US sees China its biggest potential strategic rival and the fundamental momentum of the two nations' relationship is certainly a mirror of the dynamics of power balancing between the two countries. The only way China can mitigate its strategic passivity is by increasing its own strength. In other words, this should be the first rule in the China-US relationship in years ahead.China cannot remain inactive against US provocations but the manner of our reactions cannot set us too far apart from where we can stand firmly. China should seek more tangible outcomes in its engagement with the US than superficial symbols. The US has made a flurry of unfriendly moves against China recently, which among other things, include the US Senate Armed Services Committee passing a bill to allow US warships to resume port visits to Taiwan and the US Treasury Department announcing sanctions against China's Bank of Dandong. The situation is testing China's will and wisdom. But this is by no means a major test for China but rather a normal ""assessment quiz."" China should perform firmly and steadily in the quiz.

"Shanghai International Film Festival exhibits Taiwanese filmsnA Taiwan cinema showcase was held on the occasion of the 2017 Shanghai International Film & TV Festival (SIFF) as part of an event at Shanghai Exhibition Center. The exhibition, providing a trade platform for SIFF, was welcomed by a wide range of exhibitors in the sectors of film financing, production, post-production, special effects, visual effects, distribution, marketing and games. Three Taiwan films were introduced: White Ant, The Silent Teacher and Dr. Sun. White Ant is directed by Chu Hsien-che, a Taiwanese director, and stars Wu Kang-jen, a renowned Taiwanese actor who has won the Golden Bell Awards of Taiwan. The feature, nominated at Asian film festivals, won the FIPRESCI Award at the 21st Busan International Film Festival. White Ant tells the story of a young man who has a fetish for women's underwear. The man is videotaped by a girl while trying to steal underwear. The girl, instead of reporting his behavior, sends her video to the man, which changes his life. According to Chu, the man's behavior is a psychological issue and has nothing to do with morality. Dr. Sun, a 3D animated movie, attracted much attention in the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, as it is about those who overthrew the feudal imperial powers of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Sun Yat-sen, the pioneer of China's democratic revolution, is the lead character. Hsu Zhi-yi, the director of the movie, said that his production team added some fantasies and racked their brains creating characters who would appeal to both adults and teenagers. The Silent Teacher tells the story of Mrs Lin, whose body will be dissected next year by medical students. The dead bodies used for medical research and experiments are called ""silent teachers"" in Taiwan. The documentary's director, Maso Chen, said he hopes that it will inspire younger generations who feel unsure about their future to think more about the meaning of life and encourage them to cherish everything they have. The film was shortlisted at Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival, North America's largest documentary film festival. The trailer has been viewed more than 1 million times; 80 percent of its audience are young adults, among which most are females. Poster of White Ant Poster of The Silent Teacher Poster of Dr. Sun Better at noncommercial films According to Winne Wang, assistant vice president of CNplus Productions, Taiwanese films are deeply influenced by European films, especially Italy and France. ""Taiwan is better at noncommercial films focusing on unnoticeable issues such as social problems, humanity and life values,"" Wang said, adding that these three movies perfectly reflect Taiwan's film industry. ""Popcorn movies meet people's demand for entertainment and socializing, but noncommercial films help people to dig into humanity,"" said Wang, adding that massive capital flow contributes to the boom of commercial films. ""Instead of using fancy effects like Hollywood does,"" Wang said, ""Taiwan films, in a simple and plain way, take audiences to a silent moment where they can feel compassionate and think about their own lives."" ""Taiwan's new movie movement occurred in the 1980s, which built up a solid foundation for our film industry today,"" she said. ""Famous Taiwanese directors like Hou Hsiao-hsien have brought great influence to the younger generations."" ""We are also cooperating with companies in the Chinese mainland in different aspects including production, actors, capital and effects,"" Wang said.

"Chinese mainland urges DPP to give up ""Taiwan independence"" stancenChinese mainland urges DPP to give up ""Taiwan independence"" stance Only by giving up on ""Taiwan independence"" can the current administration of Taiwan genuinely enhance cross-Strait relations, a mainland spokesperson said Wednesday. Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, made the remarks at a press briefing when answering media questions. Ma reiterated the significance of the 1992 Consensus, which stresses that the mainland and Taiwan belong to one China, and that the fundamental nature of mainland-Taiwan relations is not a state-to-state relationship. The fact that the mainland and Taiwan belong to one China has never changed and will never change, and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China is a line that cannot be crossed, he noted. Based on the one-China principle, China has always upheld that the two sides could seek solutions to political differences through equal negotiations, Ma said. Taiwanese mainstream, he said, was in favor of opposing ""Taiwan independence"" and championing the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations. A healthy, stable and win-win cross-Strait relationship is crucial to the economic development and social stability of the island, Ma continued. The DPP would be well advised to understand the situation and make an informed choice, he said. The mainland also firmly opposes attempts by any countries that have diplomatic relations with China to develop military bonds with or sell weapons to Taiwan, Ma stated. "	6/28/17	0	0	0.9393	1
"Taiwan leader’s Twitter post infuriates the publicnTaiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen's official Twitter account has been inundated by a flood of comments, allegedly from Chinese netizens, after she wrote a tweet on June 27 which thanked Japan for supporting Taiwan in joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).""I've received positive remarks from Yoshihide Suga, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, regarding Taiwan's participation in the TPP, and I'm truly encouraged. I also appreciate Japan's support,"" said Tsai Ing-wen, in a post that was written in Japanese. She also attached a link to the report about Suga's statement from the Japanese newspaper Nikkei.According to Nikkei, Suga said at a press conference that he welcomed countries and areas, including Taiwan, to join the TPP. He also said that Japan will provide necessary aid to countries and areas interested in joining the partnership.The post has been retweeted over 1,200 times at time of writing, attracting heated discussion from netizens on both sides of the debate.""It's unbelievable that Taiwan's leader would stoop so low in order to gain some international attention. Your language is the marker of your identity, yet you give it up in exchange for some sympathy. So pathetic,"" one Chinese netizen wrote.Others ridiculed her for copycatting US President Donald Trump , noting that Tsai has been using social media platforms to carry out her diplomacy, without the courage to face reality.In response to the criticism, some netizens, especially those from Taiwan, defended Tsai for her behavior, suggesting that writing a thank you note in a foreign language shows respect to other nations.This is not the first time that Tsai has posted controversial remarks in a foreign language on her official Twitter account. In May, Tsai shared a video entitled, ""Leave No One Behind: WHO Cares, Taiwan Cares,"" in a Japanese-written tweet in an unsuccessful attempt to join the World Health Assembly. Her failed stunt was later condemned by both mainland authorities and the public, with many netizens calling her ""the shame of Taiwan."" "	6/28/17	0	0	0.9551	1
"Former Taiwan leader Ma Ying-jeou stresses importance of 1992 ConsensusnFormer Taiwan leader Ma Ying-jeou stresses importance of 1992 Consensus Taiwan's former leader Ma Ying-jeou on Monday said the 1992 Consensus was the common political foundation for cross-Strait ties. Ma, at a cross-Strait economic forum in Taipei, said cross-Strait ties achieved tremendous progress since the consensus was reached. Together, the Chinese mainland and Taiwan signed the cross-Strait Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), which had saved Taiwan tariffs of up to 4.3 billion US dollars and was very helpful in lifting Taiwan's economy, Ma said, adding that a lag in subsequent agreements had distanced Taiwan from huge business opportunities on the mainland. The number of mainland tourists has fallen sharply in the last year as the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has refused to recognize the 1992 Consensus, Ma said, with many travel agencies closed, hotels put up for sale and stationary tour buses. If the DPP administration does not address the situation immediately, the consequences will be hard to predict, he warned. "	6/27/17	0	0	0.8932	1
"Former Taiwan independence supporter ostracized for change of heartnChang Wei-shan addresses a cross-Straits youth forum held on June 18 in Xiamen, East China's Fujian Province. Photo: Courtesy of Chang Wei-shan For most of her life, Chang Wei-shan, born in central Taiwan, had believed that people on the Chinese mainland were the enemy and Taiwan should be independent. But her views changed after entering college, when she became a firm supporter and activist of the island's reunification with the mainland. Despite suffering obstacles, verbal abuse and even alienation from her family and friends due to her change of heart, the 26-year-old has never had doubts about her transition, instead devoting herself to preparing Taiwan for unification. ""I think I'm doing something that I ought to do. It's just like I'm saving a guy who has fallen into the water. The only thing in my mind is how to rescue him, rather than being distracted or thinking of giving up,"" Chang told the Global Times on Tuesday. Cross-Straits relations have been strained since Tsai Ing-wen and her pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party took office in Taiwan in 2016 and refused to recognize the 1992 Consensus that endorses the One China principle. ""The clamor for independence has grown since Tsai took office. The environment for those who are pro-unification is deteriorating,"" Chang said. ""Those who do not reject unification have become silenced."" The editor of Yuan Wang, a monthly magazine founded in 1987 on the island to promote unification, Chang has been active on social media, TV programs and meetings, battling against pro-independence forces. Following in the footsteps of Sao Tome and Principe, Panama recently severed ties with Taiwan and established diplomatic relations with the Chinese mainland. However, the Tsai administration is reportedly continuing with its desinicization campaign and drafting further revisions to school textbooks. Chang believes the revisions have greatly weakened young Taiwan people's affection for the mainland, and sees herself as a victim. New thinking She said she was taught to be hostile to the mainland and worship Japan. ""Our education convinced us that Chinese mainlanders are our enemies who want to annex us,"" she said. But things started to change after she was admitted to the Department of Political Science at the Chinese Culture University in Taipei. When first asked by a teacher why she supported independence, she found herself unable to answer. She then started to read books about Chinese history, political thought and culture. In her previous education, people in the Chinese mainland were described as conservative, bad, and had no freedom or human rights. ""But after reading, I found that mainlanders' thought, instead of being useless, was much more wise and profound than that of the West,"" she said. ""I felt that being Chinese was something to be proud of."" In 2015, on her first trip to the mainland, she went to the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, where she got to know that the mainland was not as bad or ugly as it was portrayed in Taiwan. In a documentary made by ifeng.com in 2015, she openly told the story of her change of view and announced her support for reunification, which drew widespread criticism from pro-independence groups in Taiwan. A legislator on the island even openly commented that she, then a new media worker in the ""Executive Yuan,"" the Taiwan government in Taipei, should be ""killed."" In February 2016, she quit her job in the government. ""The officer asked me to be discreet in word and deed. Besides, the Kuomintang had already lost the upper hand at that time. I didn't want to work for a pro-independence government,"" she said. Left in the cold Some netizens in Taiwan attacked her on social media, asking her to ""get out and go back to China."" She fought back. ""Taiwan is part of China…You who don't recognize China should get out. Get out of Chinese territory and back to your motherland Japan,"" she posted on her social media account. Many of her relatives and friends also turned against her, too. Some friends blocked her on social media and cut her from their contact lists. Some of her relatives even said she had become radical or crazy. ""It's a pity that several aunts who had treated me well now keep their distance from me,"" she said. Her parents also worried about her. Chang laments that less than one 10th of Taiwan residents support fast unification and young people there grew up to worship Western values. At a cross-Straits youth forum on new media held recently in Xiamen, East China's Fujian Province, Chang called on young reunification supporters in Taiwan to make good use of the new media to fight against secessionist forces. In 2016, she and her team started to make videos attempting to correct the views of the Taiwan people about the mainland. In one eight-minute video published online in July that year, they explained China's historical sovereignty over the South China Sea and criticized the Tsai administration's inaction and betrayal of compatriots, which gained nationwide praise. But their efforts have been met with obstacles. Their account on Youtube was blocked within 48 hours after they uploaded a video about the February 28 Incident, an uprising in Taiwan in 1947 that protested against the Kuomintang government's suffocating rule. The reason was unclear, but she believes it was linked to pressure from pro-independence groups. In her eyes, supporting independence means choosing to stand with the US and Japan, which is immoral. ""Taiwan people are always inferior citizens in the eyes of the US and Japanese imperialists,"" she said, ""The countries care about their own hegemonic interests and don't want to see Chinese rejuvenation."" Now, the difficulty for reunification supporters in Taiwan is an acute lack of personnel and resources, Chang said. ""I always ponder the fact that even if all residents in Taiwan back independence, we would still have 1.3 billion people behind us,"" she said. But due to geographical barriers, the majority of residents on the mainland can hardly offer them help, she admitted. Despite the challenges, she said she will do whatever she can to promote reunification and national rejuvenation. ""If I can, I will try to give birth to a bunch of children who can bear the rise and fall of the world as their own responsibilities."" Some people, including her sister, have already been influenced by her and support her, she said. "	6/22/17	0	1	0.954	1
"Decoding US policy on arms sales to TaiwannIllustration: Liu Rui/GT Editor's Note: Last Wednesday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the Donald Trump administration would adhere to the one-China policy as it reviewed US policy toward China for the next 50 years. However, he also announced that the US would keep all of its commitments to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). What does Tillerson's conflicting statement mean? How will it affect the Sino-US relations? How should China deal with the Taiwan question? Global Times reporter Yang Chuchu interviewed two scholars on these issues. Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs, Renmin University of China Before Trump came to power, he had been trying to maneuver over the one-China policy. US policies on Taiwan involve not only the three Sino-US joint Communiqués but also the TRA which includes protection of Taiwan's security and arms sales to Taiwan. There are several reasons for the US insisting on arms sales to Taiwan. First, the ""America first""-focused Trump administration has close relations with arms and oil groups. For example, during Trump's recent trip to Saudi Arabia, he was busy with promoting arms sales to the country. The US arms sales to Taiwan help its arms dealers. Second, the present cross-Straits relationship is not going smoothly, providing more excuses for US arms sales. Third, by taking advantage of arms sales, the US can coerce China as well as appease Taiwan and its other allies. However, US arms sales to Taiwan not only hurt the feelings of the mainland but also shake the foundation of Sino-US relations. Although the Taiwan question is China's internal affairs, China needs to properly handle the international factors behind the question, which mainly involve the US. Besides, with the growing appeal of the mainland market, it is impossible that the US will sacrifice its interests in the Chinese mainland for Taiwan. As China has more countermeasures against the US on the Taiwan question, the US will restrain itself. Zhang Tengjun, assistant research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies It is worthy of recognition and appreciation that the US now considers its relations with China in a 50-year framework. In the past, the US government simply focused on short-term interests. Tillerson's contradictory statement on the Taiwan question highlights the dual personality of the US policies on Taiwan. On the one hand, the US said it would stick to the one-China policy. On the other hand, it used the TRA as a reason for its arms sales to Taiwan. That the US will continue arms sales is completely contrary to the content of the three Sino-US joint Communiqués, in which the US has declared its commitment to gradually decrease its sale of arms to Taiwan. This kind of vague and contradictory policy on Taiwan is a reflection of the US pragmatic diplomatic style which looks on diplomatic issues from a utilitarian perspective. There are several points China needs to pay attention to on the Taiwan question. First of all, solving the Taiwan question mainly depends on negotiations between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan. The US and China should ensure that the Taiwan question will not become an issue that affects Sino-US relations. What's more, China and the US should form a more strategic consensus on the Taiwan question so as to reduce possible friction on the question. Last but not least, the two countries should strengthen communication and coordination when friction occurs on the question. The one-China policy is the political foundation of Sino-US relations. The US selling weapons to Taiwan will only cause damage and instability on the bilateral relations. It is hoped that the US will not use Taiwan as a bargaining chip and make efforts toward a better relationship with China. "	6/20/17	0	0	0.9946	1
"Taiwan errors in Burkina Faso open door for mainlandnIllustration: Luo Xuan/GT Panama has recently cut ties with Taiwan in favor of the Chinese mainland. Will Burkina Faso be the next one to follow suit? Although Taiwan's aid to the African country is extremely generous, the economic assistance, which is politically motivated, has proved to be insufficient. Burkina Faso is one of the world's poorest countries. According to the Human Development Index, it was ranked in 2015 at No.183 among the world's 188 countries. In the past two decades, the country's economic growth has been relatively slow, while its population has grown very rapidly, from 7 million in 1994 to 17 million in 2016. Taiwan's aid to Burkina Faso is mainly focused on five areas: agriculture, healthcare, technical training, cultural exchange and energy. In terms of the strategic objectives of the assistance, Taiwan's starting point is to maintain ""diplomatic relations"" with Burkina Faso, while the development of the local economy and trade is not so important. Following this logic, Taiwan's aid does not need to use trade and investment tools nor to tighten trading ties. Taiwan's aid to Burkina Faso is only for political purposes and is completely decoupled from real business activities. Although the scale of Taiwan's aid to Burkina Faso is growing, the investment and trade ties are almost negligible. In reviewing Taiwan's aid, it can easily be seen that some of the projects are not sustainable. For instance, in 2006, Taiwan invested $3.9 million to carry out cooperation with Burkina Faso and Germany. The plan was to use the red sorghum produced by Burkina Faso to make medical alcohol. The project achieved some success in 2009, but after that the factory construction and production was stopped abruptly. Now, many government officials in the country also support the move to dismantle ties with Taiwan. Burkina Faso's relationship with Taiwan can be seen as offering only fragile development cooperation and uncertain relations. There are two reasons for this. First, it is difficult to benefit most of the people in the country if there is not investment and trade. Not mobilizing the participation of commercial funds makes it difficult to effectively expand the scope and effect of aid. Second, this lack of investment means the relationship between the two cannot get support from the public in Burkina Faso. Also, decision-making related to aid doesn't fully involve the country's economic sector and other stakeholders in the projects, which shows that the Taiwan-Burkina Faso relations have weak foundations. There are several things that can be learned from this kind of aid model. First, regarding the strategic objectives of foreign aid, it is not advisable to separate the diplomatic strategy and economic strategy; the two should share a complementary relationship. Second, when optimizing the foreign aid management framework, great importance should be attached to strengthening mutual cooperation in sectors related to investment and trade promotion. Third, full use should be made of the policy tools for the economy and trade, which will not only expand the number of participants, but also improve the capital usage efficiency of the foreign aid.

"Five countries, regions urge Taiwan to change name of representative officenChina said it appreciates countries which adhere to the one-China principle on Taiwan-related issues, after five countries and regions reportedly demanded that the island change the names of its representative offices in their countries. ""The one-China principle is widely accepted and acknowledged in the international community, and is the political basis for establishing diplomatic relations and friendly cooperation with China,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said at a daily briefing on Thursday. Lu made the remarks after Taiwan-based newspaper China Times reported Wednesday that Nigeria demanded the island to change the name of its representative office in the country from ""Trade Mission of the Republic of China (Taiwan)"" to ""Taipei Trade Office."" Nigeria and four other countries and regions are seeking the change. The four others are Dubai, Jordan, Ecuador and Bahrain, the report said, citing Chen Chun-shen, an official of Taiwan's ""foreign ministry."" ""The demand is meant to standardize the office's name and define its function in economic exchanges,"" Zhu Songling, a professor at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of Beijing Union University, told the Global Times on Thursday. ""What those countries want is becoming consistent with international rules as well as their support for the one-China principle,"" Zhu said. ""Taiwan is losing international acceptance,"" Zhu said, adding that, by blaming the mainland, they are inciting populism and pro-independence thinking within the island. During the term of former Taiwan leader Ma Ying-jeou, names of Taiwan representative offices in other countries were not a problem as both sides across the Straits recognized the 1992 Consensus that embodies the one-China principle, Zhu said. ""But since current Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen has yet to recognize the 1992 Consensus and continues to push cross-Straits ties in the wrong direction, more countries with diplomatic ties with the mainland are manifesting their adherence to the one-China principle,"" Zhu stressed. Taiwan's ""embassy"" in Panama was closed on Thursday morning. The latter established diplomatic relations with the mainland and dropped Taiwan on Tuesday. "	6/15/17	0	0	-0.514	-1
"Experts say more countries will ditch Taiwan after Panama establishes ties with mainlandnPanama Vice President and Foreign Minister Isabel de Saint Malo (left) and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi share a toast after signing a joint communique on establishing diplomatic relations, in Beijing on Tuesday. Photo:AFP Panama's decision to cut ties with Taiwan in favor of the Chinese mainland on Tuesday may trigger other countries to follow suit, and that will leave the island less space in the international community if it continues to promote pro-independence activities, experts said. A joint communiqué issued by China and Panama on Tuesday said the two countries, in accordance with the interests and desire of their peoples, have decided to recognize each other and establish diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level effective Tuesday, the Xinhua News Agency reported. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Panamanian Vice President and Foreign Minister Isabel Saint Malo de Alvarado in Beijing on Tuesday to sign the communiqué. The communiqué on Tuesday recognizes the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate government representing China, and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, Wang said in a statement released on the Chinese foreign ministry's website. Panama also promised to stop all official exchanges with Taiwan. Wang said the Panama government's decision is consistent with the country's fundamental interests and the one-China structure in international society. Hsiao Shih-yan, a senior Taiwan media employee, told the Global Times that Panama was a vital ally of Taiwan in Central America, and severing those ties will come as a huge shock to the island, which could snowball. Panama established ""diplomatic relations"" with Taiwan in 1954. Twenty countries continue to have ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan, including the Vatican, Haiti and Paraguay, according to the Taiwan administration website. ""Panama knows very well that Taiwan's economy does not serve Panama's interests,"" Hsiao said, noting that it would be very difficult for Taiwan to sustain relations as its economy declines. Inevitable trend Wang Jianmin, a Taiwan affairs expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday that Taiwan should reflect instead of blaming the mainland for its loss of allies. ""It is inevitable that more countries will pursue diplomatic ties with the mainland due to the latter's growing economic might."" The Taiwan ""foreign affairs department"" announced Tuesday that it has ""severed diplomatic relations with Panama,"" and expressed their ""regret and dissatisfaction"" with Panama's decision. The department condemned the mainland for ""squeezing Taiwan's living space in international society."" ""Taiwan authorities should take Panama's move as a warning that there will be less and less 'international space' for the island if it continues to promote pro-independence activities,"" Wang Jianmin said, warning that the Taiwan administration could issue a strong reaction. ""The world only has one China. The international community has reached a consensus to adhere to the one-China principle,"" Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, said on Tuesday. Ma stressed that only by acknowledging the 1992 Consensus, could cross-Strait relations return to the correct path of peaceful development. ""The Taiwan administration must gain a clear understanding of the situation and make the right choice,"" Ma said. A recent online poll in Taiwan revealed that over 80 percent of Taiwan residents think that the island should improve ties with the mainland, and 88 percent of respondents agreed that they are ""members of the Chinese nation,"" the Taiwan-based China Times reported Tuesday. Enhanced cooperation ""China welcomes Panama to the Belt and Road initiative,"" Wang Yi said on Tuesday, adding that the two countries will cooperate in various fields, including trade, investment and tourism, as well as deepen their mutual political trust. Panama is located in the southernmost part of Central America. The Panama Canal connects the Atlantic and the Pacific and is located between South and North America. China is the second-largest client of the Panama Canal, just behind the US. Trade between China and Panama reached $6.4 billion in 2016. Over 30 Chinese companies, including Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies, operate in Panama, a significant increase from three years ago, Wang Weihua, permanent representative of China's Office of Commercial Development in Panama, told the Global Times. Many Chinese companies have been engaged in infrastructure projects such as bridges, subways and ports on the Panama Canal, while others have been setting up regional headquarters in the country, Wang Weihua said. Aside from the tremendous opportunities in infrastructure, Panama's advantage in transportation and favorable policy towards foreign firms, including tax and visa arrangements, have convinced many Chinese firms to set up their regional headquarters in the country, he added. ""Though China and Panama enjoy close economic and trade ties, the newly-established diplomatic ties could further enhance economic and trade cooperation. And the cooperation will be more stable and transparent,"" said Jiang Yong, a research fellow at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations. "	6/13/17	0	0	0.9915	1

"Taiwan-HK ‘democracy’ group will harm mainland tiesnMainland experts said they believe an organization set up by pro-independence activists in Taiwan on Monday out of ""concern for their counterparts"" in Hong Kong shows collusion between pro-independence activists in the two regions, and will harm their ties with the mainland. According to a report on Beijing-based haiwainet.cn on Monday, Huang Kuo-chang, a major figure in the 2014 ""Sunflower Movement"" against the cross-Straits service trade agreement, and Hsu Yung-ming, a Soochow University political scientist, funded the so-called ""Taiwan-Hong Kong alliance front under Taiwan's Legislative Yuan"" in Taipei. They claim that the organization was meant to ""show Taiwan's concern for the democratic process in Hong Kong and to promote democratic exchanges between the two regions,"" Hong Kong-based on.cc reported Monday. Huang and Hsu are leading members of Taiwan pro-independence group New Power Party (NPP). Eighteen Taiwan legislators joined the new organization, five from the NPP and the others from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Taiwan media reported. Hong Kong legislators, including Nathan Law Kwun-Chung and Joshua Wong Chi-fung, student leaders of the Hong Kong Occupy protest, attended a tea party to ""celebrate the establishment of the organization,"" on.cc reported. ""We must be vigilant since the new organization probably indicates a collusion of Taiwan and Hong Kong pro-independence activists,"" Yin Hongbiao, a professor at the School of International Studies of Peking University, told the Global Times on Monday. Yin warned that the move would damage ties between the Chinese mainland and the two regions. Yin's warning was echoed by Zhu Songling, a professor at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of Beijing Union University, who explained that ""Taiwan-independence groups like the NPP like to use a referendum and democracy as excuses to incite social movements. The organization is their latest move to promote independence and create instability in Hong Kong."" One day before the establishment of the ""Taiwan-Hong Kong alliance front,"" a meeting attended by 500 Taiwan residents was held in Taipei to promote peaceful reunification, the Xinhua News Agency reported Sunday. The meeting was held amid strained cross-Straits ties and Taiwan's declining economy since the DPP, which refuses to recognize the 1992 Consensus that endorses the one-China Principle, took office, according to the report.

"Emirates Airline denies banning cabin crew’s ‘Taiwan flag’ patternnEmirates Airline denied reports that the company had banned Taiwan staff from wearing brooches with the ""Taiwan flag"" pattern before it withdrew the rule over protests, saying that it had originally intended to remove all national flag-related symbols from its cabin crew's uniforms. An Emirates spokesperson who request anonymity told the Global Times on Wednesday that the company had plans to cancel all national flag-related symbols from its cabin crew's uniforms, which was based on internal recommendations. Taiwan news portal news.ebc.net.tw reported on Wednesday that an email circulated within Emirates said the company was instructed by the Chinese mainland government to follow the one-China policy, which means ""you must remove the 'Taiwan flag' from service waistcoat and replace it with the Chinese flag…This must be followed by all Taiwan crew without exception."" A screenshot of the email was first posted by Taiwan Net users on Tuesday on twptt.cc, a Taiwan forum. The email had ignited protests from the Taiwan employees, and within less than 12 hours, Emirates said the reports on removing ""Taiwan flag"" images were false, and that the Taiwan employees will be allowed to continue to use their name tags with the ""Taiwan Flag,"" zaobao.com reported. However, the spokesperson said that an internal email containing ""error information"" was sent to the company's flight attendants but withdrawn on Tuesday.

"LGBT mainlanders cheer Taiwan gay marriage approval, but admit change for them is far offn○ The legalization of same-sex marriage in Taiwan has aroused heated discussions in the Chinese mainland ○ A lot of comments left on mainland news websites by readers criticize or ridicule the region's decision on gay marriage ○ Mainland LGBT activists say they have recently met with resistance when trying to hold events promoting rights awareness Sun Wenlin and his partner Hu Mingliang hold a symbolic wedding ceremony in Changsha, Central China's Hunan Province on May 17, 2016. Photo: CFP On May 23, Taiwan's top judges ruled that the island's current marriage law goes against its ""constitution,"" and ruled that legislators will now have to draft a new marriage law which allows same-sex couples to get married within two years. However, even before the new marriage law is passed, the court has said that same-sex couples can get married based on its interpretation, making Taiwan the first place in Asia to allow gay marriage. The latest ruling has sent ripples through the Chinese mainland as well inspiring heated discussions and debate both online and offline. While some gay people on the mainland view it as a positive signal and hope the mainland will follow suit in the future, others are more cautious about overstating the possible effects of the ruling. Outside the LGBT community, many mainlanders have expressed their opposition to the ruling. Speculators say in recent years, public views on social issues on the Chinese mainland and Taiwan have grown further and further apart, but some still hope there's a chance for reconciliation. Mixed reactions Sun Wenlin became the first person in the Chinese mainland to sue the government over gay marriage when he filed a case against the civil affairs bureau of Changsha, Central China's Hunan Province after it rejected his marriage application. Though he lost the lawsuit, 28-year-old Sun's campaign to push forward the legalization of same-sex marriage in the mainland has not stopped. ""Taiwan and the mainland have the same cultural roots. If Taiwan can legalize same-sex marriage, it's possible for the mainland to approve it too,"" Sun told the Global Times. He hopes that this can be achieved either through a court making a judicial interpretation or a direct order from the government. Li Yinhe, a sociologist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, previously told the Global Times that it would be a good idea to establish some kind of official channel for sexual minorities to express their opinions. After being rejected by the civil affairs bureau and the court, Sun has tried to talk with people from all walks of life to spread his message. He believes that if he can persuade more people to join him, they can push forward legal changes. ""But this will require money. And so far I can't find any public foundations who are willing to invest,"" he said. Despite a lack of funds, Sun is now devoting all his energy to his project to hold 100 gay wedding ceremonies in China. So far he has successfully hosted three ceremonies. ""I will continue the project until same-sex marriage is approved in the Chinese mainland,"" Sun said. While Sun is optimistic about the chances of change, Ah Qiang, founder of gay rights NGO Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays China (PFLAG), said that they won't take any new actions following the Taiwan ruling. He added that ""now is a sensitive time"" to organize LGBT events. He didn't offer further explanation about how this ""sensitivity"" is affecting PFLAG, but several other LGBT activists contacted by the Global Times expressed the same concerns. A representative from a company which since 2015 has helped gay Chinese couples get married in the US said that they won't be helping couples get married in Taiwan after the ruling. Activists looking to promote LGBT rights have met resistance in recent months. In May, an event at which gay people were supposed to deliver inspirational speeches on May 28 to encourage other members of the LGBT community, was canceled. According to an announcement from gay rights NGO Speak Out, the event's organizer, their staff spent more than three months preparing for the event in Xi'an, Northwest China's Shaanxi Province. The announcement claims that the NGO lost contact with its staff members for eight hours when their cell phones were confiscated. The announcement did not say which body their phones were confiscated by, but added that the unnamed authority also made the staff members hand over their phones' passwords. ""We don't know what has happened. Different people give us different explanations and I can't trust them,"" the announcement said. Last month, 11 mothers went to Shanghai's People's Park, a popular matchmaking spot, to find partners for their gay children. But just one hour after they arrived and set up their rainbow umbrellas and placards, they were asked to leave by local police who said they hadn't registered in advance, reported news portal thepaper.cn. Differences enlarged WeChat public account ""Pretending to be in New York"" published an article commenting on the recent development in Taiwan, writing that ""in the blink of an eye, Taiwan has gone so far, they are so fast that they have gone beyond what we could see and reach."" The author is a popular commentator who often writes about world news. He called Taiwan the ""light of Asia"" for its groundbreaking move and analyzed that this achievement is due to endless efforts by Taiwan people, first the pioneers who brought these issues into public view and then the public who embraced new ideas. He thinks this advancement is not only about the LGBT community, but about the advancement of all civil rights, and the mainland should also make moves toward eliminating inequality of all kinds. However, some argue that the mainland public does not have much awareness of not only gay rights, but all kinds of issues regarding equal rights. Observers in the mainland LGBT community say that the incidents which followed the Taiwan court's move, such as the cancellation of the Xi'an event, dampened mainland optimism and showed the differences between the different sides of the straits. Li Xiang (pseudonym), a member of Beijing's LGBT community, told the Global Times that the gay rights situation in the Chinese mainland is ""grim"" and that there are many differences between Taiwan and mainland society on social issues. ""There's more public support in Taiwan, more discussion and more media support,"" he said. ""On May 17, the International Day against Homophobia, more than 115 stars in Taiwan stood up in support of the LGBT community, which is impossible in the mainland."" Meanwhile, in the Chinese mainland, there is little media attention given over to gay rights. Indeed, Chinese language forums show that many non-LGBT mainlanders have taken a dim view of the changes in Taiwan. On mainland news website guancha.cn, the comment section on the website's article about the gay marriage ruling is filled with mockery and insults against Taiwan and its residents, saying they are looking to catch attention or that they just want to shock others. In recent years, there has been a lot of speculation that the people of the Chinese mainland and Taiwan are growing apart, especially when it comes to social issues. A Taiwan woman who works in the mainland told the Global Times she has felt a culture gap between her home and the mainland, including mainlanders not caring about the same things as her. ""I get the feeling that they mostly want to talk about economic development and have more of a nationalistic sense of pride about the country,"" she said. According a report by the Taiwan-based China Times, surveys of the region's residents showed that from 2013 to 2014 the percentage of people who identified themselves as Chinese went down from 61 percent to 47 percent. These changes have been met in the mainland with pro-forceful reunification sentiments. A 2016 survey conducted by the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences showed that more than 85 percent of the around 15,000 mainlanders who took part said they support reunification by force. Li said he's hopeful that the mainland and Taiwan can narrow their gap when it comes to gay rights. He optimistically thinks what happened in Taiwan in the long term can bring forward the LGBT movement across Asia. He knows people who have plans to get married in Taiwan, or have been so encouraged by the news that they have decided to come out to their friends and family. ""We've also seen some improvements in the mainland, such as a hashtag appearing on (social media platform) Sina Weibo that discusses the legalization of gay marriage in Taiwan,"" he said. ""I personally hope these gestures are helpful to the situation."" "	5/31/17	0	0	0.9986	1

The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration should abandon its ""Taiwan independence"" stance and antagonistic mentality, An Fengshan, spokesperson of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said during a press conference, the Xinhua News Agency reported. ""Only by recognizing the common political foundation of the 1992 Consensus can the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations be maintained,"" An said.

There's no comparing Taiwan's military power with the PLA's, Song Zhongping, a military expert who used to served in the PLA Rocket Force, said, adding that ""if we have to solve the problem militarily, Taiwan's military is no match to the PLA's, but the potential intervention of the US-Japan military alliance is of real concern to the PLA."" Army, navy and air force units were deployed for the Han Kuang exercises on the Penghu islands. ""They featured tanks, rocket launchers, assault helicopters and soldiers using shoulder-fired missiles to repel a force invading from across the 160-kilometer-(100-mile-)wide straits,"" Associate Press reported. CAN reported that Taiwan's military simulated a response to ""the landing PLA forces, and after 'the smashing firing' and psychological propaganda offensive, the PLA survivors surrendered,"" Taiwan's military said in a statement. These displays are meaningless and hilarious, Song said. ""The real combat mission strategy is highly classified and Taiwan's exercises are meant to fool the people in the island.

The Democratic Progressive Party administration should abandon its ""Taiwan independence"" stance and antagonistic mentality, An Fengshan, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said during a press conference. ""Only by recognizing the common political foundation of the 1992 Consensus can the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations be maintained,"" An said. The 1992 Consensus embodies the one-China principle. The spokesperson made the remarks when asked to comment on an ongoing military drill in Taiwan, which has simulated a mainland attack.

"Mainland gay activists hail Taiwan same-sex marriage verdictnA top Taiwan court on Wednesday ruled in favor of same-sex marriage, the first region in Asia to announce such a ruling, encouraging Chinese mainland activists and experts who believe ""it's only a matter of time"" that it would soon be legalized across the mainland. The ""Judicial Yuan"" in Taiwan said on Wednesday that current marriage laws violated both marriage freedom and equal rights. The court also gave a two year timeframe to legalize same-sex marriage. The court added that if the changes are not made within two years, same-sex couples could get married based on the interpretation. ""14 justices voted in favor of same-sex marriage, four more than the 10 needed, with only two judges dissenting,"" AFP reported. ""The ruling proves that same-sex marriage is acceptable in Chinese culture, and is likely for the Chinese mainland to legalize gay marriage within a decade,"" Li Yinhe, a sociologist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday. LGBT activists in the Chinese mainland likewise expressed the same wish, including Sun Wenlin, the first in the Chinese mainland who filed--but lost--a lawsuit to register his same-sex marriage in 2016. ""I am thrilled to see the ruling, and I think it has encouraged efforts to legalize same-sex marriage in the Chinese mainland,"" Sun told the Global Times. Sun added that the process is urgent, concerning the increasing number of gay couple in the mainland. However, Li pointed out that in order to hasten the process, the legal mechanism for sexual minorities to express their opinion and protect their interest needs to be improved, such as having an LGBT political adviser and legislator. Meanwhile, more efforts are needed to reduce discrimination against sexual minorities, she added. Sixty-three countries have nondiscrimination laws that protect gay men and lesbians, and 23 recognize same-sex marriage, the New York Times reported on May 17. "	5/24/17	0	0	0.9827	1
"World Health Assembly opens, Taiwan left outnPhoto: CGTN Delegates of World Health Organization (WHO) member states are gathering in Geneva for the 70th World Health Assembly (WHA), which opened on Monday, with Taiwan failing to be invited this year. Taiwan sent a delegation to participate in the WHA as an observer under the former Kuomintang administration which recognizes that both Taiwan and the Chinese mainland belong to one China. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a press conference on Monday that the WHA is attended by sovereign countries, and that without recognizing being part of China, Taiwan could not participate in the event. The Chinese delegation held a press conference in Geneva on Sunday, where Li Bin, head of the delegation and minister of national health and the family planning commission, reaffirmed that the cross-Straits 1992 Consensus centered on the one-China principle as a prerequisite for Taiwan's participation. Li said that during 2009 and 2016 the Chinese mainland made a special arrangement for Taiwan to attend the WHA under ""Chinese Taipei"" in accordance with the 1992 Consensus. Since Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party took office last year, the DPP has shunned recognizing the 1992 Consensus, which made it ""impossible to carry out any cross-Straits consultations for special arrangements,"" Li said. Taiwan's ""minister of health and welfare"" Chen Shih-chung held a press conference in Geneva on Monday, criticizing the Chinese mainland for what he said was hampering the Taiwan people's right to receive health information. He said the mainland talks about ""politics over health."" However, experts say Taiwan's health affairs will not be affected whether or not Taiwan attends the WHA, as non-official communication on health affairs between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan has not been impacted. The WHO has been sending information and assistance to Taiwan through the mainland since 2003, said Yu Keli, director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""The DPP administration is playing the role of a political victim to gain sympathy,"" Yu said. During the press conference, Li reiterated the stand of China's central government on safeguarding Taiwan's public health interests, and also denied the existence of an ""epidemic prevention gap"" in Taiwan. Li said that proper arrangements have been made on the basis of the one-China principle for Taiwan to participate in global health affairs and to conduct exchanges on epidemics and other health issues with WHO medical and public health experts. Through consultations with the WHO, the central government has also made proper arrangements for the application of the International Health Regulations in Taiwan, she said, so Taiwan ""can access the information on public health emergencies released by the WHO."" There have been cross-Straits deals and exchanges in the public health fields, including epidemic prevention and treatment, drug safety management and research, and traditional Chinese medicine development, with cooperation mechanisms built on responses to public health emergencies. From May 8-11, 11 countries that have maintained ""diplomatic relations"" with Taiwan sent proposals to WHO director-general Margaret Chan for a supplementary agenda item, ""Inviting Taiwan to participate in the World Health Assembly as an observer,"" according to the WHO's website. Yu said that the DPP administration always spends huge amounts of money to buy support from its allies, not only at the WHA but also at the UN Assembly every year. These political shows only serve the DPP's own interests, since ""it can show to 'Taiwan-independence fundamentalists' in Taiwan that the DPP is being tough to the Chinese mainland and firmly fights for 'Taiwan independence,'"" Yu said.

"Xi urges KMT’s Wu to ‘firmly oppose Taiwan independence’nGeneral Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Xi Jinping has urged newly elected Kuomintang (KMT) chairman Wu Den-yih to ""firmly oppose Taiwan independence,"" as the latter showed vagueness toward unification. Xi said in his message to Wu that he hopes the two parties keep in mind the well-being of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, adhere to the 1992 Consensus and ""firmly oppose Taiwan independence,"" the Xinhua News Agency reported. The CPC and KMT should stick to the correct direction for the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, and strive to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, Xi said. In his reply to Xi's message, Wu thanked Xi for his congratulatory message, saying that he expects the two parties to continue to consolidate the 1992 Consensus and promote the institutionalization of peace across the Straits. Wu said he hopes the two parties will continue to promote Chinese culture, advance the sustainable development of both sides and join each other on the road to a bright future, Xinhua reported. Wu's position is not as clear as that of former KMT chairwoman Hung Hsiu-chu. Hung said she supports unification with the Chinese mainland, but Wu refused to promise the same, Lü Cuncheng, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday. Taiwan media quoted Wu as saying it is not necessary for the KMT to stick to its past stance of unification, although independence is also not an option. He allegedly said if anyone in Taiwan wants unification, he or she can just move to the mainland without ""implicating the 23 million people in Taiwan."" Many Net users are disappointed with Wu's ambiguity. ""The mainland's Anti-Secession Law would be the institution of peace,"" read one comment posted on Sunday. The hawkish tone in the Chinese mainland is understandable because Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration led by Tsai Ing-wen has ruined cross-Straits relations, and hostility to the Chinese mainland from ""Taiwan Independence"" supporters has seriously damaged Chinese mainland people's goodwill to Taiwan, Lü said. Wu Den-yih won 144,408 votes, or 52.24 percent, beating five other candidates -Hung, vice chairman Hau Lung-bin, former legislator Han Kuo-yu, former KMT vice chairman Steve Chan Chi-shean, and former legislator Pan Wei-kang, Xinhua reported. Over 58 percent of KMT members with voting rights cast their vote. Need for patience The Chinese mainland has enough time, confidence and advantage to unify Taiwan peacefully, said Chu Yin, an associate professor at the University of International Relations. As long as the KMT and DPP continue to struggle for power in Taiwan, one of them will choose to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus and develop healthy relations with the Chinese mainland, and we will have the chance to expand and deepen economic ties with Taiwan, and this is the foundation for peaceful unification, Chu said. ""Time is on our side, no need to threaten Taiwan militarily at this moment. Wu is a party leader and is capable of leading the KMT over the DPP in the next election,"" Chu added. Compared to Hung, Wu is not firm on supporting unification, but at least he is better than Tsai. Wu will follow the former Taiwan leader Ma Ying-jeou's policy on cross-Straits relations, Lü said. ""However, the people on the island should realize that the Chinese mainland still remains patient and Taiwan should return to the one-China principle to boost economic and people-to-people exchanges with the mainland. The future of cross-Straits relations depends on the Chinese mainland's strength and will. Once the mainland loses patience, it will be too late,"" Lü stressed. "	5/22/17	0	0	0.9912	1
"Pragmatic Trump distances US from TaiwannIllustration: Liu Rui/GT As in other aspects, the government of US President Donald Trump has marked a major shift in its position regarding Taiwan. From Trump taking a phone call with Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen and questioning the ""One China"" policy to later refusing to meet Tsai when she made transit stops in the US or have another phone call with her and promising to stick to the ""One China"" policy, Trump's stance toward Taiwan has changed fundamentally. Given the rules of international relations, such changes have their own internal logic. A country's foreign policy is determined by its objective national interests while still being influenced by the subjective motives of its leader. National interests are decided by a country's strength and an international structure comprised of countries with different strengths. Taiwan is a part of China rather than an independent country. But as an economic and political entity, Taiwan has a unique position in China-US relations. The Chinese mainland, Taiwan and the US interact with each other as three parties and US-Taiwan relations maintain a special ""bilateral"" feature subject to Sino-US relations. The law of international relations can explain the changes of US policies toward Taiwan. International actors and the international pattern jointly form the international system structure. The international pattern reflects the different strengths of countries. In the current international order, there is one super power and a number of major powers. But a ""two superpowers, many major powers"" order is increasingly taking shape in the Asia-Pacific region. This means that China is gaining similar strength and influence to the US in the Asia-Pacific region, which serves as an important indicator for regional players to define their own interests. From a national level, a country maximizes its own interests with its strength as the basis and seeks corresponding foreign policies. The past disparity in strength between China and the US in the Asia-Pacific region has been bridged due to China's rise in its own strength and international status, resulting in structural conflicts and a strategic rivalry between the two. Washington views Beijing's rise as a challenge to its regional hegemony. Therefore, it tries all measures to contain China's rise, including playing the ""Taiwan card."" On the other hand, the balance of power between China and the US guarantees stability of this bilateral relationship, encouraging both nations to maintain cooperation and avoid confrontation. The US' Taiwan policy also abides by this principle. From an individual level, the preferences of leaders also affect international diplomacy. Trump is a successful businessman but has no political experience. His unique characteristics make him tend to apply his business experiences to political governance. Trump attaches importance to practical interests rather than ideology and values. This means the Trump government will not support Taiwan out of ideological or value motives as previous US governments have. Instead, it will deal with China-US relations and craft Taiwan policies based on US interests. In Trump's eyes, foreign policies can be traded. But for China, the Taiwan question and the ""One China"" policy cannot be negotiated, which means Trump's ""trade"" will not work. This explains why there has been a notable reversal in the Trump government's attitude toward Taiwan. Structural changes in Sino-US relations require the US to deal with this bilateral relationship and the Taiwan question prudently, and the Trump government has realized this. A rational US government will base its Taiwan policy on the country's best interests. Taiwanese politicians hoping to confront the mainland by siding with the US are just absurd and unrealistic.

"No space for ambiguity in the nature of cross-Strait relations: spokespersonnAn Fengshan, spokesman for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office File photo: Xinhua There is no space for ambiguity in the nature of cross-Strait relations, a Chinese mainland spokesperson said Friday.Major changes have occurred to cross-Strait situation in the past year, resulting in increasing tensions in cross-Strait relations, the loss of past achievements in peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and damages to the interests of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, due to Taiwan authorities' refusal to accept the 1992 Consensus, which embodies the one-China principle, said An Fengshan, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council.By refusing to endorse the 1992 Consensus, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has undermined the common political foundation for the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations.If the political foundation is damaged, cross-Strait relations will return to the old path of uncertainty and turmoil, An said.The fact that the Chinese mainland and Taiwan belong to one China shall not be changed, the principle of one China that is universally upheld by the international community shall not be challenged, he said.""We will unswervingly stick to the one-China principle and uphold the 1992 Consensus. We will not tolerate any attempt to separate Taiwan from China,"" An said.Chinese people on both sides of the Strait should stand shoulder-to-shoulder to safeguard the foundation of cross-Strait relations, contain ""Taiwan independence"" forces and endeavor to realize the great revival of the Chinese nation, An said.

"It’s high time to give Tsai an ultimatumnIt’s high time to give Tsai an ultimatum Even after one year in office, Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen has not given a positive response to the question of recognizing the 1992 Consensus, and this has halted cross-Straits official communications and stalled relations. Tsai dares not confront the Chinese mainland head-on, and wants to buy some time for ""Taiwan independence,"" so she has chosen to be ambiguous to scale back exchanges from the height of the Kuomintang era but prevent confrontations. In the past year, Tsai has been busy aligning Taiwan with the US and Japan to create a ""cold peace"" with the mainland. By contrast, the mainland has upheld the 1992 Consensus and squeezed the space for ""Taiwan independence"" by winning more international support. Without recognizing the consensus, there is no basis for communication. In the past year, bilateral trade stagnated, Taiwan economy headed for marginalization, and investors in and outside of the island became hesitant. Tsai's policies like the ""new invention plan"" and ""new south policy"" will also be undermined soon as they aim at breaking away from the mainland-led Asia-Pacific industrial chain and market system. The ""reform"" that Tsai talks about is implicitly geared toward independence. The welfare of Taiwan and the well-being of the Taiwan people are merely a disguise for the reform policies she has advocated to uproot the Kuomintang's political influence and foster her Democratic Progressive Party and eventually achieve ""Taiwan independence."" Taiwan people have become disappointed with Tsai. A latest popular poll in Taiwan released on Thursday shows that Tsai's approval rating has plummeted from 50.2 percent when she first took office a year ago to 33 percent now, while the rate of disapproval rose from 16.3 percent to 53.3 percent. Tsai blamed this on ""people's lack of patience,"" and she would never admit the true reason behind it. The 1992 Consensus is a question that Tsai cannot bypass or ignore, and there is only one right answer to it. It cannot be circumvented with ambiguous answers. Tsai cannot make peace with herself if she does not answer the question. One cannot wake a person pretending to be asleep. Tsai must be clear about the result of insisting on ""Taiwan independence,"" as it will have no good ending. People on both sides of the Taiwan Straits will not tolerate ""Taiwan-independence"" forces to destroy the development outcomes of the past decades. Now it's time to give Tsai an ultimatum.

"Tsai policy to blame for Taiwan’s absence at World Health AssemblynTaiwan's leader Tsai Ing-wen tweeted nine times for Taiwan's participation in the World Health Assembly (WHA) and claimed that ""health issues don't stop at the border,"" but experts said she was playing politics to gain sympathy. E-registration to the WHA ends on Monday, but Taiwan has yet to receive an invitation. Tsai has posted repeatedly on her Facebook and Twitter accounts, explaining that ""Taiwan should not be excluded from WHA this year for any reason. Health issues don't stop at border and Taiwan's role is impt (important) to global health."" The Xinhua News Agency reported that Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration should bear full responsibility for the island's absence from this year's WHA, a Chinese mainland spokesperson said Monday. ""The DPP administration refuses to recognize the 1992 Consensus, which embodies the one-China principle. This places an obstacle to Taiwan's participation in the WHA,"" An Fengshan, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said. An urged the DPP administration to reflect on why Taiwan is unable to attend this year's WHA, saying that any attempt to pass the buck or shift public focus would fail. ""Tsai and her DPP administration's political stance is sacrificing the interests of the Taiwan people. The one-China principle will never change, and if she really cares about the Taiwan people, she needs to change her attitude rather than blame the mainland. The one-China principle is the key to solving almost every problem in Taiwan, but Tsai refuses to recognize it,"" Wang Jianmin, a Taiwan-affairs expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday. ""Tsai is also trying to generate false sympathy from the island's people and international community by saying that Taiwan's health affairs would be damaged if the WHA refuses to invite Taiwan. But Taiwan's health issues won't be affected at all,"" Yuan Peng, vice president of China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said. The island can only participate when it respects the one-China principle and the Chinese mainland allows its participation as part of China, Yuan said. ""Taiwan still can join other non-political health organizations. Therefore, it is a political issue rather than a health issue,"" he said. "	5/9/17	0	0	0.9681	1

"Mainland justifies Taiwan name change in medianThe Chinese mainland on Wednesday dismissed accusations that the mainland has ""dwarfed"" Taiwan by changing how the island is addressed on mainstream media.Chinese mainland's China Central Television addressed Taiwan at the 2017 Asian Table Tennis Championships on April 11 as ""Zhongguo Taipei"" instead of ""Zhonghua Taipei.""Zhongguo and Zhonghua both mean China, but Zhonghua refers to a general concept of a Chinese nation, while Zhongguo refers to the People's Republic of China.The change has sparked criticism from Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Katherine Chang, who said that her ""government"" would not accept this ""unilateral act of dwarfing"" from the mainland.The mainland's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Ma Xiaoguang said Wednesday that mainland media has always reported on Taiwan-related events according to the one-China policy, and that the so-called ""act of dwarfing"" does not exist.""Our policy is consistent and has not changed.

"Akama’s Taiwan visit serves multiple goalsnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT Editor's Note: Japanese Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications Jiro Akama visited Taiwan on Saturday, becoming the highest-level government official to visit the island since Japan broke diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1972. What are his intentions? How will the visit influence Sino-Japanese relations? The Global Times talked with two Chinese experts on the issue. Chang Sichun, associate research fellow with the Institute of Japanese Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Akama became the first high-level official to visit Taiwan since 1972 on Saturday. It was a move to, once again, test Beijing's bottom line for Tokyo's Taiwan policy after Tokyo renamed the former Interchange Association, Japan (IAJ), responsible for maintaining unofficial relations with Taiwan, as the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association on January 1. Since Democratic Progressive Party, led by Taiwan's current leader Tsai Ing-wen, won the election in 2016, Abe's administration has shown extreme interest in Tokyo's ties with the island and has taken every chance to showcase how close the relationship is between Japan and Taiwan. Tokyo's tendency of proactively using Taiwan as a pawn to contain China has become more and more apparent. Alarmingly, apart from Tokyo seeking to strengthen its political and economic relationship with the island, it also tries to make a breakthrough in Japan's security partnership with the island in an attempt to counter China's maritime strategy. The political and legal status of Taiwan and ties between Taiwan and Japan are major obstacles in Sino-Japanese relations since the San Francisco Peace Treaty took effect in 1952. After China overtook Japan as the world's second largest economy, Tokyo has become wary of Beijing's rise and started to expand its alliances to contain China's growth. Since Abe took office again in 2012, the nation's politics have been rapidly drifting to the right while its society has become more and more conservative. The two sides of Japan's China policy have become more apparent. On the one hand, Japan wants to benefit from China's economic development. On the other, Tokyo spared no effort to counterbalance China over the latter's emergence. This year marks the 45th anniversary of China-Japan diplomatic normalization. Tokyo should not challenge Beijing's core interests. Instead, the two countries should face history squarely and work together in a bid to build a bilateral relationship based on mutual understanding and respect. Despite some divergences in interests, China and Japan should continue the people-to-people exchange and step up their effort in the extensive cooperation in fields like environmental protection, senior care in an ageing society and tourism. Li Ruoyu, assistant research fellow at the Institute of Japanese Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said the visit contradicts to Japan's policy of only having non-governmental and local level exchanges with Taiwan. China is resolutely opposed to it. Akama's visit to Taiwan shows Japan's intention of altering its relationship with the island. It is worth noting that there are other actions taken by the Japanese government recently that resemble Akama's recent visit. For example, on January 1, IAJ was renamed Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association. According to its official website, the association is expected to act as a bridge between Japan and Taiwan, and contribute to a better relationship between the two. At present, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is in a difficult position as he has been involved in a scandal over donations to a right-wing Japanese kindergarten. Akama's visit may be a way to divert the public's attention from the scandal to Sino-Japanese ties. Some media speculated the Abe administration is ready to deepen its partnership with Taiwan. It can be proved by a number of factors. First, there have always been pro-Taiwan forces in the National Diet of Japan, the country's legislature. Moreover, Taiwan's ""vice-president"" Chen Chien-jen publicly claimed that although Taiwan and Japan have no diplomatic relations, the two have formed a special partnership. In recent years, due to Japan's actions on the Diaoyu Islands and South China Sea issues, the official exchanges between China and Japan have declined. As China doesn't want to influence the friendly exchanges of peoples from the two countries because of a few right-wing politicians' behaviors, the non-governmental exchanges between China and Japan are still relatively frequent. This year marks the 45th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic ties between Japan and China, which provides an opportunity to warm up the bilateral relationship. However, at this critical moment, Akama visited Taiwan and dampened the Sino-Japanese relations. "	3/30/17	0	0	0.9866	1
"Taiwan on ‘wrong path’: officialnA Chinese mainland spokesperson warned Wednesday that an arms race between Taiwan and the mainland would only harm Taiwan people, after the island announced plans for submarines and vowed to upgrade its ""strategic partnership"" with the US. ""We resolutely oppose Taiwan engaging in military and official exchanges of any form with countries having diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China,"" Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, said at a press conference, the Xinhua News Agency reported. ""It will lead nowhere if Taiwan's authorities attempt to guard their wrong political path with bluffs or so-called military strategies,"" Ma said, adding that it would only increase tension and confrontation between the two sides, and hinder social and economic development on the island. Ma reiterated that the foundation of the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations lies in opposing ""Taiwan independence"" and adhering to the 1992 Consensus. ""We hope that the Taiwan side can go back on the right track,"" he said. ""As the foundation established by the mainland and Taiwan since 2008 has been impaired, 'Taiwan independence' forces have been itching to make trouble,"" he added. Taiwan announced plans on March 21 to build its own submarines, news portal ifeng.com reported. The craft will be jointly built by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology and local ship building company CSBC Corporation. It is estimated to cost $98.5 million and be delivered in eight years. Purchasing or building weapons is a way for ""Taiwan independence"" supporters to embolden themselves, but is no use as the gap in military might between the two sides is so huge, Liu Xiangping, head of the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Nanjing University, told the Global Times. ""And Taiwan people will not support the movement,"" Liu noted, adding that an arms race would only damage cross-Straits ties. ""Although [Taiwan leader] Tsai Ing-wen did not express support to 'Taiwan-independence' in public, her movement has released her tendency in the path,"" Liu added. One day after the submarine announcement, Tsai proposed to upgrade its US partnership at the annual dinner party at the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, ""strengthening their communication in regional security, trade and economy."" Tsai said that ""the US has always been the biggest supporter of strength to Taiwan and an important pillar to the stability in the Taiwan Straits."" However, the US would not sacrifice its core interest over the Taiwan question for it still needs China's cooperation in handling international and regional issues, said Su Ge, president of the China Institute of International Studies, adding that the mainland should maintain vigilance against military trade between the island and the US.

"Taiwan passport incident shows pro-independence thought has ""poisoned minds"": officialnThe ideology of ""Taiwan-independence"" has spread among Taiwan young people even though ""there is no place in the world one can find the Republic of Taiwan,"" a Chinese mainland official said after it was reported that a woman put a pro-independence sticker on her passport.

Developments of the investigation, in line with judicial process, will be disclosed in a timely fashion, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, told a press conference.

"Taiwan will be more secure by accepting one-China policynTaiwan's ""Minister of National Defense"" Feng Shih-kuan presented the 2017 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) to the ""Legislative Yuan"" on Thursday. In the four-yearly review, a military strategy of ""resolute defense"" and ""multi-deterrence"" is designed to serve the tenure of Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen. The ""multi-deterrence"" strategy aims to force the enemy into multi-dilemmas. As ambitious as it is, it has almost no actual military value. With the development of military strength on the Chinese mainland, the will of Taiwan's military to confront their mainland counterparts has almost collapsed. No soldiers believe Taiwan forces are capable to defend the island if the People's Liberation Army (PLA) launches a comprehensive offensive against Taiwan. The new QDR claims that the PLA is capable of seizing Taiwan's offshore islands. But isn't it an easy thing for the PLA to seize the whole island of Taiwan? The Taiwan military cannot match the present-day PLA. The mainland's military budget is more than 10 times that of Taiwan, and the PLA has superior strategic tools and systemic combat capabilities that their Taiwan counterparts don't have. The QDR is of no value to cross-Straits ties and East Asia. Taiwan's security cannot be safeguarded by military means, but can only be achieved through political approaches. As long as the Tsai government accepts of the 1992 Consensus, the island's security will be ensured. The eight-year-tenure of Ma Ying-Jeou is the most secure period Taiwan has enjoyed since entering the 21st century. However, the Democratic Progressive Party government led by Tsai has undermined the political foundation commonly agreed by the mainland and Taiwan. Without political security, what's the use of developing military strength? Taiwan has taken deterring the mainland as a key strategy, and constantly changed its deterrence tactics. But there is no need for the island to deter the mainland, as the mainland cherishes peace and won't resort to force unless it's absolutely necessary. If Taiwan is controlled by radial pro-independence forces, Taiwan's military, even with the help of the main US military forces, will not be able to deter the mainland. Therefore, the most important thing for Taiwan is not to provoke the one-China policy. This is the correct political way to protect the island's security. "	3/17/17	0	0	0.9951	1
"Mainland denies setting stricter standards for Taiwan importsnChina's chief quality supervision official denied reports that the Chinese mainland had adopted a stricter supervision standard for imported Taiwan products while acknowledging that the Taiwan leader's failure to recognize the one-China policy had hindered the flow of information between the two sides. Zhi Shuping, head of China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, said on Tuesday at a press conference on the sidelines of the two sessions in Beijing that 43 percent of the imported Taiwan products, a majority of which are food and cosmetics, were found to have poor quality and were denied entry into the Chinese mainland in January. In comparison, an average of 23.7 percent of Taiwan products shipped to the mainland were denied entry in 2016. ""Because the current Taiwan leader refuses to recognize the 1992 Consensus, our cooperation has been hindered. Some information did not flow smoothly as it did before, such as the changes in policies or standards from our side,"" Zhi said. ""However, there are also loopholes in Taiwan government's quality control, especially in terms of food. We have earnestly communicated the problem we identified in each batch of goods barred. But our advice was not heeded in time and changes were not properly implemented by the Taiwan side,"" Zhi noted. Zhi denied claims that the mainland had set a stricter supervision standard on Taiwan products and said the safety standard was universal. ""Frankly speaking, our customs department has provided a lot of convenience for Taiwan exporters, especially along the coastal areas. Despite being brothers, we also have principles to stick to,"" Zhi said. He urged the Taiwan leader to return to the track of one-China principle, saying that ""people from both sides of the Taiwan Straits belong to one China and our emotions for our Taiwan brothers would not change."" The chief quarantine and quality supervision official also spoke candidly about the quality issues of some Chinese products exported to Africa. China exports machinery and electronics, textile and apparel, as well as hi-tech products to Africa. Chinese products are popular in Africa due to their low prices. However there have been controversies over the quality of these goods. According to Zhi, in 2016 alone, China stopped more than 660,000 products from leaving the country to head to Africa due to quality reasons. ""The quality of Chinese products exported to Africa is slowly improving. The failure rate at our inspection points decreased from 7.6 percent in the past to 3.2 percent in 2016,"" he said. Zhi told the Global Times that his administration has also cooperated with 14 African countries to crack down on counterfeit products. "	3/14/17	0	0	-0.8968	-1

"PLA says official’s Taiwan statement his own viewsnThe People's Liberation Army (PLA)'s news website said the public should not over-interpret a senior military official's statement on ""liberating Taiwan"" that has sparked controversy. ""If the US deploys the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in Taiwan, it will be the day that we liberate Taiwan,"" Lieutenant General Wang Hongguang, a political adviser and former deputy commander of the Nanjing Military Area Command, told the Global Times on Friday on the sidelines of China's two sessions. Wang's statement soon ignited discussions online, with some calling it ""bluffing,"" some finding him excessively ""hawkish"" and most feeling ""shocked"" that a military officer would speak out in that manner, said a commentary from 81.cn, a news website affiliated with the PLA. The commentary added that there's no need to read too much into or make a fuss about Wang's comment, which should only be viewed as his opinion, as Wang is not the military spokesperson. The article also warned not to take Wang's comment out of context, adding that Wang is entitled to express his perspective on the Taiwan question. The article reiterated the PLA's bottom line on Taiwan, echoing a PLA Daily report released in 2000 that said "" 'Taiwan Independence' means war."" The PLA Daily article also noted that if the US did deploy the THAAD on the island, it would be seen as a form of provocation that harms the interests of the Chinese people, and that action would be taken.

"Taiwan cops arrest scammers linked to Tsinghua professor fraud casenTaiwan cops arrest scammers linked to Tsinghua professor fraud case Taiwan police arrested eight people suspected of involvement in telecom fraud that cost a professor at Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University around 18 million yuan ($2.6million), Beijing Youth Daily reported Saturday. According to a notice issued on the official website of Qingshui district police Thursday, seven men and one woman were arrested in the city of Taichung during a joint Taiwan-mainland crackdown on Wednesday. The professor, surnamed Huang, was fooled by a fraudster pretending to be a judicial official on July 23 , 2016 and was reportedly scammed out of some 18 million yuan. ""The suspect told the victim that she was involved in a fraud case and that her assets needed to be handed over for management,"" Qingshui police officer Li Guoxing told the media. Mainland police held a joint crackdown with their Taiwan counterparts after finding that some of Huang's cash was withdrawn from a Taiwan ATM and some was transferred online by devices using IPs registered in the region. The suspects were found with seven computers, 22 smart phones and 2,544 documents related to voice call systems in an apartment in downtown Taichung. The suspects were not directly involved in Huang's case but offered assistance to the scammers such as providing the voice call system they used, citizens' private information and online transfer platforms. The eight will be charged with fraud by a Taichung court. Taiwan police will continue the investigation.

"New Delhi will suffer losses if it plays Taiwan cardnAt a time when new US President Donald Trump has put the brakes on challenging China over the Taiwan question, agreeing to change course and respecting the ""one China"" policy, India stands out as a provocateur. A female ""parliamentary"" delegation from Taiwan, at the invitation of India, began a visit to the country on Monday, the first such visit since the Tsai Ing-wen administration took office. High-level visits between India and Taiwan are not very frequent, so why did India invite the Taiwan delegation to visit at this time? Some Indians view the Taiwan question as an Achilles' Heel of the mainland. They have long wanted to use the Taiwan question, the South China Sea and Dalai Lama issues as bargaining chips in dealing with China. With the advancement of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor in recent years, India's strategic suspicions about China have been growing. It stubbornly misinterprets the flagship project of the One Belt, One Road Initiative that will benefit countries along the route, including India. As the corridor passes through the disputed Kashmir, some Indian strategists have advised the Modi government to play the Taiwan card, using the commitment of the ""One-China"" policy as leverage in exchange for China's endorsement of ""One India."" By challenging China over the Taiwan question, India is playing with fire. To India, the island can not only help realize some of India's development goals, but also, strategically, check the mainland. Growing Taiwanese investment in India, including steel, telecom and information technology are important to Modi's ""Made in India"" campaign. Although the mainland is a major trading partner of India, political discord and the historical feud make economic cooperation between the two difficult. Tsai is exploiting India's vigilance and strategic suspicions against China. The pro-independence leader came up with the ""new southbound policy"" to ramp up trade and economic interactions in Southeast Asia, South Asia and Oceania, in which India is considered ""not one of the, but the most"" important country, according to Taiwan's representative to India Chung Kwang Tien. Tsai hopes to put pressure on the mainland by tying India and Taiwan closer. India wants benefits from the development of trade with Taiwan and Taiwanese investment. But it should be wary of Tsai's political intentions and avoid being used to confront the mainland. The best way for India to develop is by participating in the Belt and Road Initiative and attract more investments from the mainland. Pro-independence forces in Taiwan have become more isolated in the world. Those who want to use the Taiwan question to contain the mainland will have to suffer losses. "	2/14/17	0	0	-0.8902	-1

"Mainland resolutely opposes Rebiya’s activity in TaiwannThe Chinese mainland's Taiwan affairs office Wednesday expressed resolute opposition to a Taiwan political party's invitation to Xinjiang separatist leader Rebiya Kadeer to visit Taiwan, saying that the move will damage cross-Straits relations. ""As is well known, Rebiya is a separatist and a leader of the East Turkestan separatist forces. We resolutely oppose Rebiya's activity in Taiwan in any form,"" An Fengshan, a mainland spokesman with the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said at a press conference on Wednesday. An's remarks came after the Taipei Times reported that Rebiya, the president of the World Uyghur Congress, an organization listed as a terror group in the mainland, has accepted an invitation from the Taiwan Solidarity Union to visit the island in March. The island's separatists intended to stir up trouble by inviting such a figure to visit Taiwan, which undoubtedly will damage cross-Straits relations, An added. According to the Taipei Times, it would be Rebiya's first visit to the island, if materialized. Rebiya congratulated Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen on her election victory in May 2016 and expressed her support to Tsai's administration, the Taipei Times reported. Rebiya had been denied entry into Taiwan in 2009 under the administration of Ma Ying-jeou from Kuomintang (KMT), which was slammed by the then-opposition Democratic Progressive Party led by Tsai. During the Wednesday conference, An also reaffirmed that the mainland firmly opposes linking the issue of refugees with Tibetans living overseas, when asked to comment on a report saying that Taiwan has offered scholarships to Tibetans holding ""refugee cards.""

"Mainland mulls equal benefits for Taiwan peoplenTaiwan residents register for the Mainland Travel Permit of Taiwan Residents (MTP) at the exit-entry administration hall of the Wutong dock in Xiamen, southeast China's Fujian Province, July 1, 2015. File photo: Xinhua The Chinese mainland plans to provide Taiwan residents equal treatment, a move experts said is aimed at attracting Taiwan people under the complex cross-Straits situation and pressure Taiwan leaders who continue to refuse to recognize the one-China principle. Beijing is mapping out new policies to provide Taiwan residents with ""national treatment"" in order to help them integrate into the mainland society, Hong Kong-based newspaper Ming Pao reported on Thursday. ""To be specific, the policy is aimed at treating Taiwan people the same as local residents. It is different from 'national treatment' that refers to preferential policies for foreign entities under the framework of the World Trade Organization,"" Wang Jianmin, a Taiwan affairs expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday. Wang said Taiwan people are required to abide by the same policies as foreigners in the past due to political differences on the two sides. The new policy will make it easier for them to live and blend in the mainland. Liu Xiangping, head of Institute of Taiwan Studies at Nanjing University, said that ""the new policy will help deepen Taiwan residents' understanding of the one-China policy, laying out a basis for the reunification of the country, as well as crack down on Taiwan-independent forces."" Liu stressed that relations across the Taiwan Straits have been affected as current Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen refuses to recognize the 1992 consensus, which affirms the one-China principle. ""The move is meant to take better care of Taiwan people under the complex situation, and reflects the mainland's disappointment with the Taiwan leader,"" Liu said. The policy follows an annual meeting last month of central and local officials in charge of Taiwan-related affairs. Efforts will be made to continue unofficial exchanges and cooperation, promote economic and social integration, as well as to let the public better participate in and benefit from cross-Straits exchanges, the Xinhua News agency reported, citing a statement issued after the meeting. More policies will be adopted to help Taiwan residents study, work, start a business and live in the mainland, and to support Taiwanese companies, the statement said. Luring Taiwan people East China's Fujian Province issued a regulation in 2010 to protect Taiwan people, including them in the social insurance system and giving their children priority at schools. Fujian is 260 kilometers away from Taiwan. Trade between Fujian and Taiwan reached 69.5 billion yuan ($10 billion) in 2015, an increase of 10.3 percent from 2014, Xinhua reported. Hsueh Ching-de, a Taiwan businessman who has been investing for over a decade in Pingtan, Fujian told the Global Times that his children have a choice of schools, while local children could only enter schools in the district where they live. Shanghai included Taiwan people into its medical system in 2015, which states that Taiwan people who work in the city and their families can receive the same medical services as Shanghai residents, local news portal eastday.com reported. However, Liu said that the mainland is not likely to include Taiwan people in the national medical system before it completes its own medical system reform, not to mention the gap between the two sides in healthcare. Hong Kong-based Ming Pao Daily reported that new policies raised hopes that Taiwan people might be included in civil servant recruitment. Taiwan authorities warned that it was illegal for Taiwan people to hold a post in the Communist Party of China, military or administrative institutions in the mainland, chinanews.com reported.

Kevin added that the new policy would improve Taiwan people's impression of the mainland, which had been affected by the recent chilling of cross-Straits relations. To You Wen-han, another 27-year-old Taiwan student at Peking University, who spent four months traveling in the mainland by motorbike in 2016, the biggest problem is getting accommodations.

"Taiwan authorities daydream about allies' unconditional loyaltynTaiwan authorities daydream about allies' unconditional loyalty Burkina Faso's Foreign Minister Alpha Barry recently said to the media, ""We get outrageous proposals telling us, 'If you sign with Beijing, we'll offer you $50 billion or even more.' "" He then explained that he refused the offer because ""Taiwan is our friend and our partner. We're happy and we see no reason to reconsider the relationship."" Any rational thinking person would believe that Burkina Faso's foreign minister was saying ""nothing short of ludicrous."" Burkina Faso is listed as one of the 10 Least Developed Countries in the world, according to the United Nations. The landlocked country in western Africa has a small population of 17 million, and a backward economy of $11.2 billion GDP a year. However, such ""insane banter"" has pleased Taiwan's "" Ministry of Foreign Affairs"", as they are still grappling with the recent loss of ""diplomatic ties"" with other African countries such as Sao Tome and Principe. In response to Taiwan's reaffirmed ties with Burkina Faso and Swaziland, a spokeswoman responded, ""Our relations are concrete"". A DPP (Democratic Progressive Party) ""legislator"" also stated in his Facebook, ""It is fortunate that certain values and friends are not for sale."" The relationship between Burkina Faso and Taiwan has always been fully sustained with money. The country first established ""diplomatic"" ties with Taiwan in 1961, but later severed it in 1973. After it formed a diplomatic relationship with Beijing, Taiwan repurchased its ""diplomatic"" ties with the African country. As a recent example of the nature of their relationship, a Taiwanese ""diplomat"" promised Burkina Faso a 44 million euro ($47.33 million) aid over the next couple of years during his visit to the country last September. Beijing is not interested in utilizing monetary inducements to strengthen its roster of diplomatic relationships, a strategy obviously favored by Taiwan. Beijing's appeal is so powerful that every rational nation with a strategic vision simply wants to maintain its diplomatic ties with Beijing. This type of powerful appeal cannot realistically be replaced with monetary promises made by Taiwan. Most of the remaining 21 ""diplomatic allies"" are eager to develop relationships with Beijing. In fact, the allure is so great that Beijing could attract all of Taiwan's remaining ""diplomatic allies"" without spending a penny. It is the primary reason that Taiwan's administration remains in panic mode. Although Taiwan will always be able to maintain a few ""diplomatic allies"" by spending more money, its real threat lies within the realm of its ""diplomatic allies"" that may one day voluntarily seek comfort in the arms of Beijing, regardless of any monetary promises from Taiwan. These countries, most barely noticeable in the world map, are essential to Taiwan's ""diplomacy"", and yet dispensable to Beijing. Even if Beijing decides to teach Taiwan a lesson, buying out their diplomatic relationships is hardly an option. Burkina Faso's foreign minister mentioned the ""$50 billion"" for underlying reasons that will soon surface. He is probably campaigning and gearing up to ask Taiwan for more money, a scenario that could play out along the lines of, ""Look, Beijing offered us $50 billion. How much are you willing to propose, Taiwan? "" Taiwan's leader, Tsai Ing-wen, chose to deny the 1992 Consensus, a decision that has led to soaring prices for Taiwan's ""diplomatic"" ties. Those countries that have yet to establish diplomatic ties with Beijing have increasingly felt unconventional in the world. This explains why they willingly pursue diplomatic ties with Beijing, including Vatican that has not established diplomatic relations with Beijing for special reasons. All other countries that remain Taiwan's ""diplomatic allies"" have only done so for simple and convenient reasons based on money. Chinese mainland has risen to be a superpower on the world stage. Monetary inducements are unlikely to offset any strategic value attached to having diplomatic ties with Beijing. Beijing always has plenty of bargaining chips on the table. Taiwan is going to need more money if it wants to continue with its current strategy of ""diplomacy."" It is very likely that another one of its ""diplomatic allies"" will soon bring it the news of a $100 billion offer from Beijing. After all, denying the 1992 Consensus is an expensive game that can have less than enjoyable consequences. "	1/26/17	0	0	0.9927	1
"Mainland should prepare for Taiwan leader’s ‘extreme moves’nExperts said the Chinese mainland should be militarily prepared for ""extreme moves"" by Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen and the worst cross-Straits situation after Donald Trump became US president on Friday. Senior Communist Party of China (CPC) official Yu Zhengsheng on Friday said that cross-Straits relations and the overall situation in 2017 are more complex and demanding than ever. Yu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said the mainland will resolutely oppose and contain those seeking ""Taiwan independence"" in any form. Tsai sent an 11-man delegation led by former ""premier"" Yu Shyi-kun to Trump's inauguration, conveying the Taiwan people's and government's desire for increased cooperation and exchanges with the US, Taiwan-based Central News Agency reported on Tuesday. China's foreign ministry dismissed the delegation, saying the move was aimed at disrupting China-US relations. When Ma Ying-jeou led the island between 2008 and 2016, a delegation was also sent to attend the inauguration ceremony of former US President Barack Obama in 2013 without Chinese mainland opposition. ""The mainland reacted differently because Tsai's refusal to follow Ma's stance and accept the one-China principle,"" said Yang Lixian, deputy secretary-general of the National Society of Taiwan Studies. The Chinese mainland will continuously adhere to the 1992 Consensus, safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and maintain the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, Yu said at an annual meeting of central and local officials in charge of Taiwan-related affairs. ""The island may seek independence by amending its referendum law, attempt to gain more diplomatic room with the US and provoke cross-Straits tensions by inviting pro-Tibet and pro-Xinjiang independence forces to Taiwan,"" Zhang Wensheng, a research fellow at the Taiwan Research Institute of Xiamen University, told the Global Times. Echoing Zhang, Yang said because Taiwan is part of the mainland's core interests, the mainland can make economic, military and diplomatic sacrifices to safeguard national sovereignty when confronting the US. However, Taiwan may have to sacrifice itself if Trump uses Taiwan as a bargaining chip in negotiations with China, Yang noted. "	1/22/17	0	0	0.9375	1
"Taiwanese actress’ welcoming comments on Liaoning put her under scrutinynTaiwanese actress Liu Le-yan poses for a photo shoot. Photo: Courtesy of Liu Le-yan It is no longer a strange thing in China for political and entertainment news to mix. The most recent example of this occurred when Taiwanese singer and actress Liu Le-yan, known in Taiwan for her voluptuous figure, made controversial comments on the Chinese mainland's aircraft carrier Liaoning, which passed through the Taiwan Straits last Wednesday.When Taiwan media was hyping up the mainland's growing assertiveness in its decision to send the carrier through the Straits after drills in the South China Sea, the 33-year-old Taiwan celebrity, who now lives in Beijing, posted a series of remarks on her Facebook page. She questioned why Taiwanese are so nervous about the aircraft carrier, remarking that ""the Liaoning has come to protect us.""""As long as Taiwanese don't support independence, [the Liaoning] won't attack us. It will protect us,"" she wrote.Liu's remarks immediately drew the attention of Taiwanese media as well as criticism from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). When asked by the media what he thought of Liu's remarks, DPP legislator Huang Wei-cher said, ""I don't know which celebrity said this, but female celebrities shouldn't just be pretty and have a low IQ.""On the mainland, however, Liu received a completely different response from the media, who called her a role model with a ""correct worldview."" In a piece in the People's Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party of China, commentator Wang Ping wrote, ""If leaders of Taiwan's pan-Blue coalition [which mainly consists of Kuomintang party members] had the same courage and righteousness as Liu Le-yan, would the Kuomintang be reduced to today's situation and trampled?""Despite being at the center of the controversy, Liu insisted that she knows nothing about politics, and had no idea why she had suddenly become the center of a hot debate in political columns. ""It's really an interesting experience, but actually, I would much prefer to be featured on FHM,"" she said, referring to the popular men's magazine.But this isn't the first time the singer/actress has made such bold remarks in an industry that usually refrains from politics. In January 2016, South Korea-based Taiwan pop star Chou Tzu-yu made an apology after mainland Internet users accused her of being a Taiwan independence activist, triggering a backlash in Taiwan. Liu then posted an article on Facebook, talking about the Taiwanese identity.Liu wrote about how her grandparents had moved from the mainland to Taiwan in their early years, and how her paternal grandfather, who had been a Kuomintang soldier from Hubei Province, had fought against the invading Japanese army. She wrote that she had always seen herself as both a Taiwanese and a Chinese, and that the two terms shouldn't contradict each other.Although the article was sincere and largely recounted her own experience, it sparked criticism from some Taiwanese, who said she was trying to curry favor with the mainland.""Although there wasn't an official ban, it became more and more difficult for me to find work in Taiwan,"" Liu said.Last May, seeking a break in her career, she decided to move to Beijing.Taiwan emerged as a major exporter of popular culture to the mainland in the late 1980s, a result of its burgeoning economy and advanced entertainment industry. Television dramas and pop songs from Taiwan, along with those from Hong Kong, virtually dominated the mainland's entertainment scene in the 1990s.But the mainland's entertainment industry picked up quickly, and by 2012, its film market had become the second largest in the world, while Taiwan's economy stagnated. Lured by more opportunities, many Taiwanese celebrities started to move to and settle down in the mainland. In recent years, even obscure Taiwanese celebrities began to arrive on the mainland.Liu was one of them. Even though she had been in the entertainment industry in Taiwan for over a decade, virtually no one on the mainland knew who she was.Unable to afford the high living costs in downtown Beijing, she rents an apartment in Yanjiao, Hebei Province, about an hour's drive from the capital. She takes public transportation, eats in cheap restaurants, and calls herself a beipiao, a ""Beijing vagabond.""Her Taiwanese identity, however, often causes her problems, especially after Taiwanese actor Leon Dai, accused by netizens of supporting Taiwan independence, lost a part in a film. That incident rang alarm bells in the mainland's entertainment industry regarding the use of Taiwanese actors.Liu talks about some amusing experiences she has had doing auditions on the mainland. One director forced her to choose between the mainland leader and Tsai Ing-wen to make sure her political stance wouldn't cause him any problems down the line. ""I told him that this is meaningless because they will never compete against each other in an election. If I had to pick one, it should be between Tsai Ing-wen and Hung Hsiu-chu, candidate from the Kuomintang. He then forced me to choose between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang. To get the role, I picked the Communist Party,"" she said.On another occasion, a producer told her he had heard that there was an order from authorities not to hire South Korean or Taiwanese actors.""How could South Koreans and Taiwanese be lumped together? After all Taiwan is part of China."" She called the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council and asked whether the ban was true. It turned out that it was, indeed, nothing more than a rumor, but she still didn't get the role.Despite these adversities, Liu said she's enjoying her new career in Beijing as there are more opportunities - and more pay - over here than back home.Some Taiwanese netizens say Liu is ""kneeling in front of the Chinese for Renminbi."" Liu replied: ""Not only do I kneel, I kowtow to Chinese. I am Chinese. What's wrong with that?"" "	1/19/17	0	0	0.9921	1

""We again urge the relevant side in the US not to allow the Taiwan authority to send a so-called delegation to the US to attend the presidential inauguration and not have any form of official contact with Taiwan,"" Hua told a regular news briefing. ""China's position has already accurately and unmistakably been given to the US administration and Trump's team."" China's ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai, will attend the inauguration on its behalf, she added. Trump is to be sworn into office on Friday local time.

"China prepared for long-term struggle on Taiwan question under TrumpnExperts said China is prepared to engage in a long-term struggle on the Taiwan question with the US, after China's foreign ministry responded to US President-elect Donald Trump's statement, saying the one-China policy is the political foundation of bilateral ties and is ""non-negotiable."" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang made the remarks Saturday in response to Trump's statement that the one-China policy on Taiwan is up for negotiation, and that he is not fully committed to it. ""Everything is under negotiation including one-China,"" Trump was quoted as saying in a Friday interview with the Wall Street Journal. China's foreign ministry had previously refrained from directly commenting on Trump's statements or his protocol-breaking phone call with Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen. Trump is less than a week away from becoming the 45th US president. ""China cannot and will not offer anything in exchange for the one-China policy, and Trump must understand that,"" Shi Yinhong, director of the Center for American Studies at Renmin University, told the Global Times. ""China's clash with Trump on the Taiwan question will last as long as it takes. If Trump refuses to listen to what China has to say, China's reaction will escalate accordingly,"" Shi said. He also noted that China will be closely watching what Trump does as president rather than what he has been saying. The government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing China, ""which is an internationally recognized fact and no one can change it,"" Lu said. ""We urge the relevant party in the US to realize the high sensitivity of the Taiwan question and abide by commitments made by previous US governments to the one-China policy and the principles of the three joint communiqués.""

"Denial of ‘one China’ brings fear to TaiwannForeign Minister Wang Yi and his Nigerian counterpart met the press together on Wednesday, during which Wang spoke highly of Nigeria's moves several days earlier to revoke the consular privileges enjoyed by a Taiwan representative office and order it to move out of the Nigerian capital to uphold the one-China policy.Nigeria's action is only one episode of events that Taiwan pro-independence forces are going to witness. Tsai Ing-wen thought she would bring a surprise to independence advocates by refusing to recognize the 1992 Consensus and talking to Donald Trump over the phone, but these moves are going to create shocks instead.As the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria is a vital power in global political and economic affairs, and its latest move sets an example for others. It is hoped that other countries will follow suit and squeeze the international space of Taiwan's independence advocates.Taiwan's pro-independence forces are depressed about the decision of Nigeria and trying to win some sympathy through playing the victim.The Chinese foreign minster always starts a New Year by visiting Africa. Chinese diplomacy is based on relations with developing countries, among which Africa is at the core. China is willing and capable of making new contributions to the peace and development of Africa through deepening cooperation. Currently, China and Africa are together exploring new concepts of bringing bilateral cooperation to a new height. African countries understand the importance for their development and support China's position on national unity.Reunification of China is desired by all Chinese, which is an unalienable part of world peace. China is contributing about 30 percent of global economic growth under the win-win concept, therefore the reunification of China is a prerequisite of stability of the world.Taiwan's pro-independence forces are like gamblers, and such trend is beyond their imagination. They bet on the US for their fate, thinking as long as they follow the US closely, like flirting a bit with Trump, they would gain some more space in the world. They are totally wrong.For every bit of empty promise that the Taiwan's pro-independence forces get from the US, we will make them pay the price; for every bit of ""good news"" they get, they will feel multiple fear. The Chinese mainland is wise and strong enough to turn the ""lifeline"" of pro-independence forces into a rope to strangle them.Nigeria will not be the last country to put pressure on Taiwan. Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party will live in fear as long as they don't recognize the 1992 Consensus and the one-China principle. "	1/13/17	0	0	0.9953	1
"PLA confirms aircraft carrier Liaoning passed through Taiwan Straits on ThursdaynPLA confirms aircraft carrier Liaoning passed through Taiwan Straits on Thursday The People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy has confirmed that the Liaoning aircraft carrier passed through the Taiwan Straits on Thursday before dawn This is the first official release of information about the Liaoning's activities from the Chinese mainland since Taiwan's media reported on its movements Tuesday. Navy spokesperson Liang Yang said on Thursday morning that ""A naval formation consisting of the aircraft carrier Liaoning on Thursday passed through the Taiwan Straits en route to the South China Sea for drills and tests."" Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the PLA Naval Military Studies Research Institute, told the Global Times on Thursday that the Liaoning battle group's movement in the area showed that the aircraft carrier is combat ready, which is good news for the Chinese people, but those who want to separate China's territory and support Taiwan independence will surely be afraid and panic. An anonymous official told the Taiwan-based news website udn.com on Tuesday that Taiwan sent a Successful-class frigate from its 146 fleet to the eastern side of the straits to follow the Liaoning. An E-2C early warning plane was also sent to the area. The Liaoning' s movements would have been transmitted to the Hengshan Military Command Center in Taipei, and Taiwan's ""defense minister"" Feng Shih-kuan headed to the Hengshan Military Command Center at that time, udn.com reported.

"Beijing won’t yield to US bullying over TaiwannTaiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen embarked on a nine-day visit on Saturday to Nicaragua, Salvador and Guatemala, with stopovers in the US. While Tsai did not meet with US President-elect Donald Trump or any members of his transition team during her US stay, she met with senior US Republican lawmakers including Ted Cruz. Over the past month, Trump has made a series of provocations against China. He had a phone call with Tsai and questioned the one-China policy. He also launched an attack on Twitter against China's monetary and South China Sea policies. Many are concerned that his moves will cast a shadow over the Sino-US relations. Trump playing the Taiwan card is a show orchestrated for months by Taiwan and US officials, including former senator Bob Dole, former US ambassador to the UN John Bolton, and Stephen Yates, previously an analyst at the Heritage Foundation. In particular, Yates was a missionary in Taiwan in 1987-89, later became deputy national security adviser to vice president Dick Cheney from 2001 to 2005, and is now Idaho's GOP chairman. Last month, he again visited Taiwan purportedly in an attempt to enhance US relations with Taiwan. But senior US experts on Asia affairs didn't agree with Trump. Soon after Trump's call with Tsai, Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the president-elect ""does not really comprehend how sensitive Beijing is about this issue."" Evan Medeiros, the Asia director at the White House national security council, warned that ""this phone call will fundamentally change China's perceptions of Trump's strategic intentions for the negative"" and will set a foundation of ""enduring mistrust and strategic competition for US-China relations."" Christopher Hill, former assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs under George W. Bush, called it a ""huge mistake."" But the criticism doesn't seem to make Trump and his team knuckle under. He will likely continue to stir up troubles concerning Taiwan. To be specific, he may enhance the level of US-Taiwan exchanges and facilitate more bilateral interactions between military officials. He may also increase the arms sales to Taiwan, as long advocated by John McCain, chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee. This is highly likely since Taiwan authorities have agreed to increase its defense spending to 3 percent of the GDP. Trump is also expected to financially back Taiwan by signing the bilateral investment and trade agreement. In the meantime, Taiwan will play a bigger role in the US policy on the Asia-Pacific region. Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro wrote in November on Foreign Policy that the Obama administration's treatment of Taiwan is ""egregious"" and the ""beacon of democracy in Asia is perhaps the most militarily vulnerable US partner"" in the world. An amendment passed by the House of Representatives directed the US secretary of defense to grant observer status in the US-led Rim of the Pacific Exercise. It's worth noting that Trump may link the Taiwan question with the Korean Peninsula. Michael Flynn, who was tapped by Trump as his national security advisor, said that North Korea's nuclear program will become the Trump administration's most urgent national security challenge. In meeting with a group of South Korean lawmakers in early December, an official of Trump's transition team said China should work hard on North Korea as much as it cares about the cross-Straits issue. In handling the Ukraine crisis, the Obama administration underestimated how firm Russia could be to defend its own interests and hence the bilateral relations plunged to the lowest ebb. Russian leaders even sent an explicit warning against a new Cold War. Now Trump and his transition team are severely underestimating the possibility of strong reactions from China, though Beijing has so far exercised restraint, which was even commended by Henry Kissinger. Beijing surely hopes to keep a stable relationship with Washington, but it won't allow any bullying from the US over the Taiwan question, which is germane for the Chinese leadership in assessing the intentions of the US policy. Many of Trump's advisors were pro-Taiwan or have economic links with the island, and he has picked multiple hawks with military background as his aids. This adds to his chances of making missteps and taking risks when it comes to China. Trump called his strategy unpredictable. As an enormously conceited revisionist, his possible negative impact on the Sino-US relationship may have been considerably underestimated. Thus, drastic conflict between Beijing and Washington is definitely not good news for Asia and the whole world.

"Mainland needs flexible tactics for TaiwannTaiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen met with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Governor Greg Abbott in Houston on Sunday as she stopped over in the US on her way to Central America. This is the general treatment for Taiwan leaders when they transit via the US.Cruz, who was defeated by Donald Trump in the Republican primaries, told media that ""The People's Republic of China needs to understand that in America we make decisions about meeting with visitors for ourselves."" Texas has a close trade relationship with Taiwan, with many of the local electorate hailing from the island, which is believed to have something to do with Tsai's meeting with Cruz and Abbott.On principle, the US government should not allow Taiwan ""presidents"" to transit its soil or carry out activities within the US. Washington should not sell arms to Taiwan and interfere in cross-Straits affairs. But Beijing cannot sever US-Taiwan relations now.Tsai's meeting with the Texas governor matches her title which is equivalent to the head of China's Taiwan Province. Cruz failed in his bid to become US president. He may find it congenial to talk with Tsai, a pretend Taiwan ""president.""No federal officials met Tsai this time, and the Trump team also said it would not meet her. It is not known who else she has met. Her activities in Houston seem furtive.If the US wants to have a normal relationship with the People's Republic of China, it cannot act wantonly. Previous Taiwan ""presidents"" have never managed to transit via Washington, DC. Chen Shui-bian once transited in New York. At the current stage, neither China nor the US can force the other to fully accept its own principles or accept rules set by the other. They are locked in a stalemate.Taiwan chooses to drift between Beijing and Washington, the two major powers in the world. It is bound to be kicked around by both. In 2006, Chen Shui-bian was asked to transit in Alaska rather than a major continental US city. The Tsai administration had a phone call with Trump, but may be ""betrayed"" by the president on another day. This is the fate of being a pawn of external forces.China and the US have been locked in a seesaw struggle since the Taiwan question intensified in 1996. Taiwan independence reached a climax during that time. But the mainland has also enhanced its ability to control the situation in the Taiwan-Straits. At the beginning, the Americans dominated the trend of Taiwan independence, but as the Chinese mainland's strength increases, it is gradually taking the initiative back.In the past, the mainland only focused on sticking to its principles, but lacked flexibility. In the future, it should seize strategic initiatives and be flexible in its tactics. The mainland can play the Tsai administration like a fiddle. It may not fix the issue once and for all, but at least it can entertain the mainland public, which has been angered by Taiwan independence forces. "	1/9/17	0	0	0.8606	1
"Which way forward for Taiwan and the United States in 2017?nIllustration: Liu Rui/GT Since Taiwan's leader Tsai Ing-wen made a congratulatory phone call to US president -elect Donald Trump on December 2, a spate of commentary is discussing whether Taiwan's value to the US is growing or shrinking. Some who claim to be from the Trump camp argued that the next president doesn't see a need to be as deferential to the mainland concerning Taiwan, and the new administration will do more for the island.Trump himself tweeted that the US sells arms to Taiwan, so why should he not talk directly to Taiwan's leader? But in a TV interview, he also argued that the ""one China policy"" in which relations with Taiwan are embedded should be negotiable together with other priorities such as trade. This has stirred fears in Taiwan and hopes in China that America's focus on Taiwan may be weakening in favor of other considerations.Where is the US-Taiwan relationship headed in 2017? It's too early to try and guess the Trump administration's intentions. Its personnel selections and policies are still in flux and subject to internal debate and external criticism. In an atmosphere of uncertainty, such as today, it is my experience that the best option is to review the fundamentals of the Taipei-Beijing-Washington triangle and seek the sources of continuity and change.Taiwan: Taiwan's recent election results have demonstrated that a majority of Taiwan residents want to enjoy the economic benefits of a reasonably close relationship with the mainland, but fear losing autonomy if the relations become too strong. Voters appear to believe that the previous administration of Ma Ying-jeou drifted too close to the mainland. The administration of Tsai Ing-wen balances between these forces by pledging to maintain the status quo while refusing to endorse explicitly or implicitly the concept of ""one China.""After making the unprecedented congratulatory call to Trump, Tsai has played down its significance. Every Taiwan leadership has prioritized relations with Washington's leaders, as the sole source of outside military support for Taiwan, and that is not likely to change anytime soon. But the economic reality of Taiwan's codependency with the mainland will not change either.China: Beijing's adherence to the goal of reunification with Taiwan appears undiminished. Over the past 20 years, China has deliberately strengthened its commercial and military capacity to influence events in Taiwan or to take action if it believes Taiwan has crossed the line toward permanent secession from the mainland. But China has also used the political foundation of the ""1992 consensus"" to provide a cloak of ambiguity within which to deal with Taiwan officials during the transition period toward the reunification it eventually seeks.The new trend in cross-strait relations is becoming more negative. The phone call to Trump appears to have commenced the unwinding by Beijing of the so-called ""diplomatic truce"" with Taipei over competition for third countries to recognize one or the other capital. Beijing has moved cautiously, possibly testing Taipei's reaction and willingness to lose more of its ""diplomatic partners."" But the direction seems clear as of now. There will be a diplomatic price for what has happened. Beijing sees Taipei as trying to inch itself away from the mainland, and is sending a clear warning signal for Taipei to reconsider.The United States: Washington is generally growing more skeptical of Beijing over a variety of issues, including intensifying strategic competition, regional frictions, and trade and investment irritants, thereby reducing tolerance to accommodate China, including over Taiwan. At the same time, both Clinton and Trump emphasized domestic priorities in their recent political campaigns, and Trump is expected to deliver on his pledge to ""make America great again."" How to focus on the domestic agenda while meeting challenges from China, Russia, and disorder in the Middle East is one of the major tasks of the Trump administration.Trump's public statements tend to focus less on values than interests, continuing the pendulum swing tradition of US presidents trying to counterbalance what are seen as the excesses of their predecessors, in this case of Obama promoting liberal outcomes without follow-up, as in Libya. But no president has been able to escape the pull of both values and interests. And in this area, Taiwan is still of major concern to Americans as an embodiment of liberal values, capitalist and free market economics, and a working democratic system that stands in contrast with much of Asia. The carefully structured ambiguous US position regarding Taiwan's status is widely believed in the US to have helped preserve these valued elements of Taiwan's society, when backed by strength.Chinese and other observers would do well to calculate the enduring respect in the US for Taiwan's system and not count on this changing, even under stress. Equally, US observers would do well to remember that China's formal commitment to reunification with Taiwan is unchanged and enjoys strong emotional support. A wise course of policy for all would be to focus on what can be done to maintain the high quality status quo than challenge the fundamental values of each other.The mutual restraint among the three parties with regard to their maximalist goals has created space for creative relations for decades, while fully satisfying no party. The interests of the three may wax and wane, but they are not going to disappear and deserve to be treated with respect.The author is Vice President for Studies and Senior Fellow, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington, DC. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	1/8/17	1	1	0.9985	1
"Famous HK, Taiwan artists pulled from numerous mainland music platformsnChinese music streaming platforms Photo: IC Taiwan singer Bobby Chen Photo: IC Music fans were shocked Friday to find some of the biggest pop artists from Hong Kong and Taiwan were suddenly missing from the majority of mainland music streaming platforms. The disappearances spread throughout the weekend, as Mandopop mega artists from Taiwan and Hong Kong such as Vivian Hsu from Taiwan and Hong Kong's Bobby Chen and Anthony Wong were missing from NetEase Cloud Music as of Saturday evening. That same day, many Taiwan and Hong Kong artists were also pulled from major streaming platforms such as QQ Music, Kugou Music and Baidu Music. Though rumors quickly flew on social media that the disappearances were the result of a government-sanctioned ban on these artists, the most likely culprit is music licensing agreements. A visit to Alibaba-owned Xiami Music on Sunday reveals the platform was still streaming music from Taiwan and Hong Kong artists. According to The Beijing News, Xiami holds the streaming rights to Bobby Chen's catalog. Pointing to the recent pull down of online content such the streaming show Evil Minds 2, some outlets surmise that the disappearance of these artists' music is the result of increased government regulation. A likely scenario is that these other music streaming services have lost or did not have the rights to these artists' music and were forced to remove content by related authorities who are now doing more to enforce copyright protections. While the takedowns may not be connected to politics, the disappearance of Taiwan and Hong Kong musicians from platforms quickly sparked discussions about the role artists' past political opinions should play when it comes to their work. ""I think it is right to remove some singers although I appreciate their talents. After all, supporting 'Taiwan and Hong Kong independence' is not right,"" Zhang Haihuai wrote Saturday on Wechat blog Rockerfm. Regardless of the reasons for the takedowns, music fans were still disappointed to find a number of their favorite artists missing from their playlists. ""As I woke up to thick smog, I found that they had erased not only the names and songs on the platform, but also those I downloaded to my phone's memory,"" NetEase user Wang Meijun told the Global Times on Saturday.

Mandopop mega artists such as Vivian Xu from Taiwan and Hong Kong’s Bobby Chen and Anthony Wong were missing on NetEase Cloud Music as of Friday evening. By Saturday, many of Taiwan and Hong Kong artists were pulled from major streaming platforms such as QQ Music, NetEase Cloud Music, Kugou Music and Baidu Music. Neither the government nor the music companies involved have made statements on the matter as of press time. A call to NetEase on Saturday night went unanswered. Alibaba-owned Xiami Music was streaming the above artists as of Saturday night. According to The Beijing News, Xiami holds the licensing copyright to Bobby Chen’s catalogue. However, numerous media outlets did not hesitate to run and repost stories alleging the Taiwan and Hong Kong artists had been banned due to their political leanings. “I think it is right to remove some singers although I appreciate their talents.

Many netizens chose to focus not on the possibility of music copyright conflicts and more on politics. An ad campaign for cosmetic brand CHANDO featuring Vivian Xu had been pulled. The Taiwan pop star had been replaced in the ad by Mainland actress Zhao Liying. Xu had found disfavor among fans in the mainland in 2010 following comments made in Tokyo that Japan was “like her adoptive mother.” "	1/7/17	0	0	0.0183	1
"Cross-Straits conflicts may come earlier than expectednIllustration: Liu Rui/GT Not long after Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen had a phone call with US President-elect Donald Trump, the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, passed by the Obama administration, supported the US Department of Defense to promote military exchanges with Taiwan. The moves fuelled tensions between Taiwan and the mainland, making the relations across the Straits the center of attention. As the situation between the two sides worsens, it is suggested that the Chinese mainland make efforts on the following aspects. First, the mainland should improve efficiency in its Taiwan policy. Many of the mainland's policies toward Taiwan have seldom benefited the middle and lower classes. Therefore, the mainland should pay more attention to these groups' interests so as to obtain their support. Second, it is necessary for the mainland to take measures to punish those who support Taiwan independence. Economic sanctions and diplomatic containment are needed. Some Taiwan people have the illusion that there is no price for advocating independence. The mainland must let them know the consequences of their actions. Third, carrying out military preparations and exercising the obligations in the Anti-Secession Law are essential in case of emergency. In regard to the recent moves of Washington, it shows the US is trying to use Taiwan as a bargaining chip to contain China. In the past, the US has an overwhelming advantage over China in military power, thus it has few worries about China. However, China has become capable of challenging the US within the first island chain. With fewer leverage to balance China's influence, Washington plays the ""Taiwan card"" to impose pressure on China. However, the US should know that taking advantage of the Taiwan situation is very dangerous. The Chinese mainland holds a firm stance on the Taiwan question and there is no negotiating space as the issue is related to Chinese sovereignty. With the successful implementation of military modernization, the Chinese mainland has largely improved its ability to deal with the Taiwan question. The mainland has comprehensive industrial and military systems. In military strength, the mainland far surpasses Taiwan, putting Taiwan's pro-independence parties in a very difficult position. They have relied heavily on US protection in case of military conflicts between the mainland and Taiwan. But now, it is almost impossible that the US will confront the mainland militarily to protect Taiwan. In the past, the US military strength is much stronger than that of Chinese mainland. However, due to the mainland's development in recent years, the US military advantages are shrinking. A confrontation between the two will lead to a great loss for the US. Therefore, the US will be hesitant about military confrontations against the mainland. In a few years, after China's overall national strength and military power rise to a new level, the US will not be able to have a military confrontation with the mainland over the Taiwan question as it is not only useless but also causes huge losses to the US. It can be said that the stronger the mainland's military power is, the less likely the US will be to intervene in and provide military protection for Taiwan. Given the situation across the Taiwan Straits, it is possible that the mainland will unite with Taiwan through military force. It was once estimated that the mainland and Taiwan are likely to come into military conflicts in Tsai's second term. However, with the new development in Taiwan and the behavior of Tsai authorities, the time for the conflicts may come earlier than expected.

"Taiwan sets conditions on mainland performancesnTaiwan authorities have set conditions on local celebrities who wish to perform in the Chinese mainland, which experts said poses a challenge to cross-Straits ties.

The post added that concerts could be suspended over the current situation and political atmosphere. For instance, the annual Two Sessions in March and the National Day holidays in October are both sensitive periods in the Chinese mainland, and celebrities might face stricter conditions. The post also warned celebrities to check if the sponsors and venues are acceptable in the mainland. ""When you are in the Chinese mainland, follow the local rules.

""Almost all cross-Straits communications have been suspended…but Chang Hsiao-yueh, head of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said the council is finding ways by posting a notice on Facebook,"" the Taiwan-based United Evening News reported on Wednesday.

US President Barack Obama on Friday signed into law the US National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, which includes a non-legally binding section providing for the US defense secretary to conduct a program of senior military exchanges between the US and Taiwan, the first time since 1979. When asked to comment on the Act, An said, ""We hope the US will abide by the one-China policy and the three China-US joint communiques, and carefully handle issues related to Taiwan,"" adding that China firmly opposes official and military relations between the US and Taiwan in any form. Liu said the Act will affect cross-Straits ties as it opens doors for military exchanges and arm sales between the US and the Taiwan island, which will probably lead to an arm race between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan. However, Liu pointed out that the US only wants to use Taiwan to contain the mainland and make money through arm sales. ""The only way for the island to safeguard itself is to maintain a good relationship with the mainland,"" Liu commented. In response to another question, An said that a Chinese navy formation, including the aircraft carrier Liaoning, headed toward the West Pacific on December 24 for a scheduled blue water training in accordance with the navy's annual plan. ""We always handle Taiwan-related issues based on the one-China principle, and any attempt to create 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan' is doomed to failure. The historical trend is irresistible,"" An said. Xinhua contributed to this story "	12/28/16	0	0	0.0346	1
"Beijing has final say on peace or war cross StraitsnIllustration: Liu Rui/GT US President Barack Obama signed the US National Defense Authorization Act for the 2017 Fiscal Year into law on Friday. For the first time, it included a section that allows civilian officials at the level of assistant secretary of defense or above and serving military officers to visit Taiwan for exchanges - a breakthrough in upgrading the level of military exchanges since the US ended its diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979.The signed bill was approved by the US Senate and House of Representatives earlier this month, getting the jump on Obama's successor Donald Trump before he leaves the Oval office, which brings about new challenges for Sino-US relations and adds uncertainties to the cross-Straits situation.It would be unrealistic for Taiwan to take it as extra protection from Washington and think it will become safer. The island has been overwhelmed by the Chinese mainland in terms of strength, and the US military can no longer dictate the cross-Straits situation. The military exchanges between Washington and Taiwan bear more political symbolism than anything else. Whatever attitudes the US military takes wouldn't matter if Beijing resolves to take over the island.One important point is that the upgraded military exchange is sure to dampen Beijing's faith in a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question, thus prompting a serious consideration of military action which has been widely discussed in the mainland after Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the island, directly called the US president-elect. The debate is not driven by the nationalist anger, or the attempt to intimidate Taiwan. Many have agreed to the fact that Beijing will have to strengthen its military forces to secure the Straits.Since 1996, Beijing has stopped its missile test in the region, as well as other military warnings against Taiwan's ""independence"" ambition. However, this ambition has been revived again after Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took the leadership and Washington appears ready to use the island as a bargaining chip with Beijing. The challenge facing Beijing to take practical actions against the ambition is now an unavoidable and realistic question.Sao Tome and Principe's split with Taiwan doesn't seem strong enough as a punishment to quell the ambition. Apart from the diplomatic measures, Beijing needs to take military actions to crack down on DPP's arrogance.Previous editorials from the Global Times have suggested the need for Chinese warships to cross the ""middle line"" in the Taiwan Straits, and fighter jets to fly over the islands, which has been echoed by influential Chinese including academicians.It is believed that Chinese military has potential options to respond to any provocations from Taiwan, especially on its offshore islands closer to the mainland.But Taiwan doesn't believe Beijing would really take military actions and those ""independence"" advocates still believe they are taking the control.As such, Beijing is expected to break their mind-set, dismiss Tsai's strategy with a feasible practice to shock the island and force DPP to pay the price.Additionally, the national Anti-Secession Law needs to be activated against those advocates and other organizations who schemed to divide the country under the mainland's law enforcement, which could exert mental stress on the separatists.There is no need for Beijing to worry about Washington's intervention though. The moves, such as Tsai's denial of the 1992 Consensus, Trump-Tsai phone call and the upgraded military exchanges, have interrupted the stability across the Straits. If the Trump administration opts to engage in a geopolitical friction with China over the Straits, Beijing has the edge - stronger military control and resolution - and would win over Washington.A few of Beijing's actions on the island would undermine Tsai's political approvals, as well as Taiwan's economy. This doesn't signify a potential war but a high pressure germane to the Straits conflict that Taiwan wouldn't even bear. It's Beijing who has the final say between peace and war on cross-Straits relations, not Taiwan or the US.The article is an editorial of the Chinese edition of the Global Times Monday. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	12/26/16	0	1	-0.1872	-1
"Taiwan agricultural fair highlights importance of cross-Straits tiesnA three-day fair featuring agricultural products from Taiwan and promoting tourism ended at the Beijing Exhibition Center on Monday. The fair had attracted nearly 130 exhibitors. Mainland businesses signed cooperation contracts with county authorities from Taiwan, the Xinhua News Agency reported. ""The number of mainland tourists to Taiwan has substantially dropped since May when the island's newly-elected leader took office,"" Peng De-huei, dean of the supply and marketing department of the Beipu Farmers' Association, told the Global Times on Monday. Peng said that although the cooperation mechanism between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan has not been suspended, fewer activities were held. ""The fair showcased both sides' determination to improve cross-Straits ties, and was also a good opportunity to improve mutual understanding between people from the mainland and Taiwan."" The State Council Taiwan Affairs Office in September announced the mainland would promote cooperation with eight Taiwan counties on the basis of the 1992 Consensus, said Xinhua. The 1992 Consensus affirms the one-China principle, which current Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen has yet to recognize. Chen Huei-lin, owner of Taiwan-based cultural and creative company Youle Chuangyi, said some mainland tourists started to worry about the safety of traveling to Taiwan, since the pro-Taiwan independence Democratic Progressive Party is in power. ""But the people's goodwill has never changed. Communication between the mainland and Taiwan, especially cultural exchanges, should continue to promote understanding across the Straits,"" noted Chen. Fu Kun-chi, head of Taiwan's Hualien county, said at the fair's opening ceremony on Saturday that their booths were not only meant to showcase agricultural products grown by the Taiwan people, but also their confidence in working together with the mainland people at a difficult time for cross-Straits relations, Xinhua reported.

"US Defense Act a pro-Taiwan ploy: expertsnThe signing into law of the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, that includes US military exchanges with Taiwan, shows a growing hard-line stance on China among US lawmakers and an attempt to normalize ties with Taiwan after Donald Trump takes office, experts said. ""We are strongly discontented with the US for signing the act … and have lodged solemn representations with the US,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said on Sunday night. US President Barack Obama on Friday signed into law the US National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, which includes a non-legally binding section providing for the US Defense Secretary to conduct a program of senior military exchanges between the US and Taiwan. ""Although the law's Taiwan-related content has no legal binding force, it still severely violates the three joint communiqués and interferes in China's domestic affairs. China will by no means accept this,"" Hua said. ""The US is attempting to normalize its relations with Taiwan through the act, indicating that their relations would be elevated from an unofficial to an official one,"" Ni Feng, deputy director of the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. ""At worst, the act will allow Taiwan to join military drills in the Asia-Pacific region, signifying the restoration of a military alliance between the US and Taiwan, which would sour its diplomatic ties with the Chinese mainland,"" said Ni. ""The passage of the act shows the rise of hardliners in the US Congress, which is likely to result in a tougher stance on China after Obama bows out, echoing Trump's policies,"" Zhou Qi, an executive director and senior research fellow at the National Strategy Institute of Tsinghua University, told the Global Times. ""Taiwan, however, is only a pawn in a future trade war between the US and China,"" Ni noted. Trump broke diplomatic taboo by making a phone call to Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen when he won the US presidential election. The call is the first between a US president or president-elect and a Taiwan leader since 1979. "	12/26/16	1	1	-0.802	-1
"Opponents protest bill to legalize gay marriage in TaiwannHundreds of same-sex marriage opponents in Taiwan took to the streets on Monday to protest against the passage of the first reading of the amendment drafts to the Civil Code, a move that could make the island the first region in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. Witnesses in Taiwan reached by the Global Times said that the well-organized protestors moved from Taiwan's Legislative Yuan to the ""Presidential Office,"" requesting Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen to step down. Photos and videos provided by a witness surnamed Zhang showed that the protestors wearing white shirts and holding up signs that read ""one man and one woman, a husband and a wife,"" ""textbooks advocating free sex must be withdrawn from campus"" and ""step down, Tsai Ing-wen."" The island on Monday took a major step toward legalizing same-sex marriage as the Legislative Yuan approved the first reading of the draft amendments, which will undergo the second and third readings before they become law, the Taiwan-based Central News Agency reported. A Taipei resident surnamed Chen, who is a gay, told the Global Times that he was thrilled to see the passage and many young people in Taiwan are more open to gay couples. The decision also exhilarated gay rights activists in the Chinese mainland. Ah Qiang, a well-known gay rights activist and founder of LGBT advocacy group Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians And Gays China, told the Global Times that the Legislative Yuan's decision stands out as one of the notable landmarks in the progress of gay rights movements. ""As the gay rights movements have made slow progress in Asia, Taiwan stepped ahead and set a major milestone for the region,"" said Ah Qiang. The passage is a hard-won success and may face obstacles in the future, but it will encourage more and more gay couples in the mainland to hold a wedding ceremony in Taiwan and inspire mainland legislators to think about the legalization of same-sex marriage, Ah Qiang added. There are some organizations in Taiwan, especially those with religious background, which have been opposing the legalization of same-sex marriage, as they believe it would damage family values and compromise social stability, he said. However, as in the West, the opposition will subside and it will just take some time, he said. A survey conducted by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation showed that 70.7 percent of the respondents said there was no rush to legalize same-sex marriage while 22.9 percent considered it to be necessary.

"Taiwan risks full 'diplomatic' isolation under DPP rulenTaiwan risks full 'diplomatic' isolation under DPP rule China and Sao Tome and Principe resumed diplomatic ties on Monday, less than a week since this African island nation broke relations with Taiwan. Gambia, another African country, resumed ties with China three years after cutting off relations with Taiwan. This is a warning Beijing has sent to the administration of Tsai Ing-wen. Within Taiwan, there is also speculation that Beijing and the Vatican are in close touch regarding establishing diplomatic ties. Tsai will head to four Central American countries with a stopover in the US in January. Taiwan public opinion has been worried about the possibility that a particular country may break ties with Taiwan before Tsai's departure, a huge embarrassment she will suffer. If the Tsai administration continues to deviate from the one-China principle, which prompts the Chinese mainland to block Taiwan's diplomacy, the remaining 21 countries with which Taiwan holds diplomatic ties will all follow Sao Tome during the rule of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), leaving Taiwan completely isolated. While the DPP wants to prove that Taiwan is an independent and sovereign country, the mainland should make it realize what Taiwan really is. Taiwan authorities feel degraded about taking part in international events under the banner of ""Chinese Taipei,"" but it may risk losing even that qualification to attend international activities. Currently, Taiwan can set up representative offices in other countries. But if Taiwan independence forces do not stop, Beijing can lobby these countries not to host Taiwan offices. The mainland can resort to military means. In addition, it can consider plans to single out advocators behind Taiwan independence and exert punishment. These two options will wield more deterrence and be more efficient. Since the DPP refuses to admit the 1992 Consensus and colludes with the US and Japan to break the status quo of cross-Straits relations, they have to take the blame for the end of peaceful exchanges between the two sides and bear the consequences. This perhaps is a period of chaos Taiwan and the mainland have to go through before they embark on the path of unification. Although the mainland will suffer some losses as well, it can withstand them. The mainland public is fed up with appeasing Taiwan endlessly and is ready to smash independent forces. Once the Taiwan Straits runs into trouble, the independence forces will lose ground. DPP authorities should be made to realize that they have no mandate to rule the island with Taiwan-independence thinking. The mainland, rather than the US, has become the sole force to dominate the situation in the Taiwan Straits. If Taiwan authorities willingly become a pawn of the US and confront the mainland, they will only face a dead end. This is perhaps our last fight to eradicate Taiwan independence forces.

"Sao Tome cuts ties and tolls bell for Taiwan ‘diplomacy’nAfrican island nation Sao Tome and Principe announced Tuesday that it has cut its so-called ""diplomatic"" ties with Taiwan and acknowledged sovereignty of the People's Republic of China. Sao Tome is the first country to break ""diplomatic"" relations with Taiwan since Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen took office. Taiwan ""diplomacy"" has suffered its first setback after Tsai's phone call with US President-elect Donald Trump. The Chinese mainland immediately gave positive feedback and stressed the universality of the one-China policy, but kept silent on the mainland's role in the event. The diplomatic break is not accidental. It is obviously a punishment for Tsai's refusal to recognize the 1992 Consensus and her other provocations against the one-China policy, including the phone call with Trump. The event is also a response to Trump's wrong stance on the Taiwan question. The Taiwan authorities cited Sao Tome's request for enormous aid for the diplomatic cut off, hoping to divert public attention from political reasons to economic ones and to help Tsai acquit responsibility. Sao Tome asked for $210 million from Taiwan, according to local media reports. In fact, Taiwan has long been providing aid to those small and poor countries that it has ""diplomatic"" ties with. The number of countries that have ""diplomatic"" ties with Taiwan has dropped from 22 to 21. Sao Tome may start a new wave of ""diplomatic breaks"" with Taiwan. Taiwan witnessed the first such wave last century when the People's Republic of China was founded and the mainland joined the UN and established diplomatic relations with the US. The number of countries that Taiwan has ""diplomatic"" ties with kept declining during Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian's terms, and stayed at a relatively stable level only during Ma Ying-jeou's term when Taiwan authorities acknowledged the one-China policy. Tsai's rejection of recognizing the 1992 Consensus is a reckless move at a time when Taiwan's strength gap with the mainland keeps widening. As Taiwan is just the size of a province, it cannot compete economically or diplomatically with the mainland. The Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) push for Taiwan independence will herald Taiwan's ""diplomatic"" suicide. Its attempts to make Taiwan look like a sovereign state will however see the island further abandoned and turn its so-called sovereignty into a laughing stock. Trump calling Tsai ""Taiwan president"" won't change the situation that the world acknowledges the one-China principle. In fact, Trump didn't want to override the policy. He just wanted to use it as leverage and Taiwan as a pawn against the mainland in negotiations for economic interests. In the near future, Taiwan will predictably have to see some other countries break ""diplomatic"" ties with Taiwan and seek to establish ties with Beijing. In the changing world, the mainland's One Belt and One Road initiative well responds to the development needs of developing countries, and the attraction of building a comprehensive relationship with the mainland far outmatches the short-term interests of Taiwan's economic aid. These countries will hardly stay for Taiwan's small favors if they are to be accepted by the mainland. If the DPP continues to pursue Taiwan independence, Taiwan will lose all the countries that have the ""diplomatic"" ties with it. This is a blind alley and an insult that the authorities forced on Taiwan society. The reunification of the mainland and Taiwan has already started. When the mainland was frail, Taiwan muddled around in the international community. But now that the mainland has grown strong enough to take Taiwan into its economic orbit, the two have been deemed by the world to be a bigger entity. The earlier Taiwan realizes and accepts it, the earlier its situation will be improved. "	12/21/16	0	0	0.5267	1

"Taiwan could be Trump’s biggest victimnIllustration: Peter C. Espina/GT The wrestling between China and the US over the Taiwan question escalated following US President-elect Donald Trump's telephone conversation with Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen and his provocative remarks on the one-China policy. Trump's actions seem pro-Taiwan, but in fact, Taiwan would be the biggest victim. The Taiwan authorities, especially pro-independence forces, joyfully welcomed Trump's behavior at the very beginning. This top-level telephone interaction was the first since the establishment of China-US diplomatic relations in 1979. Trump's acceptance of the call has upgraded communication channels with and dramatically boosted ties to Taiwan. His remarks about the one-China policy have jeopardized the political basis of China-US diplomatic ties, and are what pro-independence forces are eager to see. However, the Taiwan authorities and public opinion soon changed their attitude over the issue. Tsai asked her Democratic Progressive Party to stop commenting on Trump's actions, and deployed Wu Chao-hsieh, ""Secretary-General of the National Security Council,"" and Lee Ta-wei, ""Minister of Foreign Affairs,"" to Washington to ascertain Trump's real Taiwan policy. Local media outlets also advocated Taiwan to be alert to whether Trump would abandon Taiwan for US interests. Taiwan has good grounds to be concerned about Trump's actions. To begin with, Trump has not yet officially taken office, and his remarks cannot represent the US government. US President Barack Obama voiced totally different views on Taiwan in the wake of Trump's provocative actions, asserting that the US will not change its stance on the one-China policy. Trump has also been criticized by mainstream US scholars for his behavior. By hyping up the Taiwan question, Trump is just using Taiwan as a bargaining chip to win more benefits from China. ""I fully understand the one-China policy, but I don't know why we have to be bound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News. Trump is trading the Taiwan question with China. The Chinese government has reiterated that the one-China policy is not negotiable. If China makes concessions, does it mean that the US would abandon Taiwan? There are always forces in the US advocating that the country could abandon Taiwan to obtain maximum benefits from China. Taking a step back, Trump's pro-Taiwan stance would bring no good to the island. It is predictable that Trump would allow top-level exchanges with, sell a large amount of advanced weapons to, and use the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement to expand exports to and absorb investments from Taiwan. These actions, seemingly beneficial to Taiwan, are, in essence, forcing it to pay high prices for protection from the US. Taiwan would have to sacrifice trade, economy, public welfare and its overall interests for it. More importantly, the advancement in the US-Taiwan relationship will invite a strong retaliation from the Chinese mainland. Just as most media outlets analyzed, Taiwan would be first to be targeted if it moves closer to the US. Pro-independence activities, in all forms, and pro-independent forces colluding with exterior forces can never be tolerated. If the Taiwan authority boosts its ties with the US, or is willing to be maneuvered by the US as a pawn, it will touch the bottom line of the Chinese mainland. China and the US reached consensus on the one-China policy in the 1970s when China was weak and poor. China has now developed into the world's second-largest economy in the 21st century, and has the capability, determination and wisdom to make Taiwan and the US pay heavier prices.

"Taiwan pro-independence forces play Trump cardnPro-independence forces in Taiwan are taking advantage of the confusion caused by US President-elect Donald Trump but they could face economic sanctions from the Chinese mainland if they keep whipping up sentiment hostile to the one-China consensus, according to analysts.

Chang said that the mainland has always applied a carrot and stick policy toward the island. His words came in response to comments from former deputy commander of the Nanjing military region Wang Hongguang, who said that military conflicts would occur between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan by 2020 at an annual meeting of the Global Times on Saturday in Beijing. Liu Xiangping, head of the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Nanjing University, slammed Chang's comments about the mainland's policy on Taiwan as ""very irresponsible."" Liu said that Wang's comments were based on the Anti-Secession Law as well as the current situation of cross-Straits ties. ""Wang's comments also reflect a growing concern in the mainland over 'Taiwan independence' given the strong pro-independence sense of current leading groups,"" said Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China. Not revisiting policy According to Liu, pro-independence forces in Taiwan were encouraged recently by US President-elect Donald Trump after his phone call with Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen where he referred to Tsai as the ""Taiwan president."" Former Taiwan ""vice-president"" Lu Hsiu-lien said Monday that there was hope that the next US government would rethink their relationship with Taiwan after the call. Trump made another surprising remark about the Taiwan question last week during an interview on the Fox News network, saying ""I do not know why we have to be bound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade."" Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus denied on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace that Trump would revisit Washington's decades-old one-China policy after Obama warned Trump in the conference not to incur Beijing's ""very significant"" reaction. ""We are not suggesting that we are revisiting the one-China policy right now,"" Priebus said, adding that Trump was not president right now and he was respectful to the current president. However, Ni Yongjie, vice director of the Shanghai Institute for Taiwan Studies, said that Priebus' words should not be taken as a sign that Trump was stepping back on the Taiwan question given his recent assignment of several hawkish officials. Jin said that Sino-US ties would become strained after Trump takes office. Economic slump Recent comments by US President Barack Obama and Trump's questioning of the one-China policy have created a favorable situation for Taiwan, Taiwan-based Central News Agency reported on Sunday, citing Wu Rwei-ren, an associate research fellow at Academia Sinica's Institute of Taiwan History. However, Ni warned that Trump is only using Taiwan as a bargaining chip to gain advantage in cooperation, especially in trade, with China. Jin said that it is very possible that the mainland would impose sanctions on Taiwan by suspending economic cooperation and compressing its international space if cross-Straits ties keep worsening. Liu added that Taiwan pro-independence forces will hurt the interests of Taiwan eventually if they sacrifice cross-Straits ties in seeking support from the US. ""Without mainland support, it is impossible for the island to complete an industrial upgrade,"" Liu noted, adding that the Taiwan economy would end up in a long-term slump if a standoff is incurred.

"Taiwan-mainland war discussions break outnA photo published by the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) showing a bomber flying above the clouds has caused great concern in Taiwan amid discussions about whether the mainland will reunify the island by force. The PLA Air Force published the photo on its Sina Weibo account, showing an H-6K bomber flying above the clouds with two mountain peaks rising in the distance. Military commentators on the mainland believe the peaks are of a mountain in Taiwan, which has made many netizens marvel at the PLA's military capability. However, the spokesman of Taiwan's ""Defense Ministry,"" Chen Zhongji, told the Central News Agency that military aircraft from the mainland could only fly outside the air defense identification zone of Taiwan and the ministry could grasp their movements, saying the guesses were groundless. Military expert Chen Weihao told Taiwan-based satellite television channel and cable TV network TVBS that it was the first time that mainland aircraft had been photographed with Taiwan landscapes, which has a psychological impact on the island. Discussions about the possibility of the mainland reunifying Taiwan by force continues to gain momentum as pro-independence Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen keeps whipping up anti-mainland sentiment. ""The Taiwan regional government has lost its independence and become an agent of US and Japanese anti-China forces,"" Wang Zaixi, former vice president of the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, said at an annual meeting of the Global Times on Saturday in Beijing, adding that the mainland is the only force at present that could curb ""Taiwan-independence"" forces. ""Military conflicts would occur between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan by 2020. It is quite possible that the mainland will take the island in one stroke,"" former deputy commander of the Nanjing military region Wang Hongguang said, adding that US President-elect Donald Trump has pushed cross-Straits ties to a critical point, given his recent words on the Taiwan question. However, Chen Yixin, a political expert from Taiwan-based Chinese Culture University, told the Global Times that Chinese leadership might not favor reunification by force, which would hurt both sides' interests. ""The mainland is upset about some of Tsai's policies such as Taiwan's culture independence, but they haven't had a great impact yet,"" Chen said. ""Even though Tsai wants to pave the way for jurisprudential independence, she does not have the nerve to do it, and the US will not necessarily admit the independence,"" Chen said, adding the mainland should show some restraint.

"New Cold War more dangerous than any previous conflict: PilgernPhoto: Courtesy of John Pilger John Pilger's new documentary The Coming War on China was released last week in selected UK cinemas and broadcast on ITV. Filmed over two years across five potential flashpoints in the Asia Pacific, it reveals the build-up to war on more than 400 US military bases that encircle China in ""a perfect noose."" Pilger said that the US and China may be on the road to war, and nuclear war is no longer unthinkable. What drove Pilger in making this film? What are the stories behind the investigative shooting? Global Times () London Reporter Wei Sun interviewed Pilger about his new film and observations on the China-US relationship. GT: What drove you to make this documentary? When did you start it? Pilger: The Coming War on China has taken more two years to make. I have made numerous films in Southeast Asia, where I reported as a foreign correspondent during the time of the Vietnam War and Pol Pot. I had not been to China for a generation and felt a film about the US and China today was long overdue, especially one that challenged the stereotypes and myths that undermine our understanding of the rise of China. The Coming War on China is really about rapacious ""gun boat"" power and asks audiences in the West, especially in the US and Britain, to ""look in the mirror."" Since 2009, I've followed developments in the Philippines. That was the year Hillary Clinton, then US Secretary of State, flew to Manila and demanded the return of a major US military presence. In the 1990s, two of the biggest US bases in Asia, Subic Bay and Clark, were closed as a direct consequence of a popular movement against the violence generated by the bases among local communities. With bribes in the form of military hardware, Clinton persuaded the government of Benigno Aquino to accept five ""rotational"" US bases - to counter Chinese appropriation of unoccupied islets in the strategic Spratly Islands (Nansha Islands in China). At that time, China and the Philippines were negotiating the disputed ownership of the Spratlys; and Clinton declared the South China Sea vital to America's ""national security interest."" The issue, she said, was ""freedom of navigation."" In fact, the issue was China's rise as an economic power and the insecurity of the top dog in Washington. What had been a regional dispute was now a flashpoint between the US and China. In 2011, President Barack Obama announced his ""pivot to Asia"" - this meant the transfer of 60 percent of US air-naval forces to the Asia Pacific, with China the undeclared target. This was the starting point of the film. GT: So far, what kind of feedback have you received? What do you think British cinemas and TV channels value most about your film? Pilger: This is my 60th film and I have a history in investigative film journalism, mainly on television. My first film, The Quiet Mutiny (1970), revealed an insurrection in the US conscripted army in Vietnam that led to the withdrawal of all US forces. Britain has an eclectic and often proud documentary history and the British public has grown used to challenging films - though not so much lately. The Coming War on China had a substantial TV viewing audience last week. Reviewers have given it four stars (the Guardian, Radio Times). More than newspapers or other popular media, documentary films have the license and power to help people make sense of the news, and the world. In the ""China Rises"" section in my film, the archive film of China as a colonially subjugated society is astonishing; that no Chinese was allowed to enter the United States legally for 100 years is revealed as hidden history. Who knew? Yet, the ripples today are obvious, or ought to be. GT: You mentioned in the documentary that there are more than 400 American military bases encircling China with missiles, bombers, warships and nuclear weapons. How many US overseas military bases did you go for investigation? Pilger: I have been to many US bases in Asia over the years. Today, it's increasingly difficult. I passed through the Ronald Reagan Missile Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Here, Star Wars weapons are tested; missiles are fired as part of the secretive Space Fence project. This base is one of America's stepping stones to Asia, and was set up in 1968 to ""counter the threat from communist China."" I often film undercover, and that can have its uncertain moments. GT: You have spent two years making this film and traveled a lot of places. Who did you meet in the countries especially in China and US? Do you think the rivalry and even hostility between the two countries is becoming more apparent? Pilger: I met senior officials in the US State Department, and those with considerable influence in China. I interviewed war planners, academics and ordinary people resisting the threat of nuclear war, notably on Okinawa which has 32 US military installations and China as a target. There is a remarkable sequence with a former US Air Force missile serviceman who witnessed, on Okinawa, the final moments of the mistaken launch of a nuclear missile at China during the 1962 Cuban crisis - and which was halted only after an alert officer realized the order was false and stopped the countdown at gunpoint. One strategist in China told me, ""We are not your enemy, but if you [in the West] decide we are, we have to prepare."" GT: You mentioned that the aim of this film is to break a silence about the renewed possibility of conflict, even nuclear exchange, between the United States and China. There has been a lot of discussion about the outbreak of war between China and the US. Do you think it is more likely that conflict will erupt now compared to the past? Pilger: What I do know is that the new Cold War is, in one respect, more dangerous than its predecessor. During the first Cold War, there were red lines that the protagonists dared not cross; these were well defined. Now there are no red lines. The German foreign minister said as much the other day. NATO forces are on the western borders of Russia - unthinkable 60 years ago - the US and China are skirmishing in the South China Sea, and the US Navy is rehearsing a blockade of China's oil and trade routes. GT: What's your observation and prediction on China-US relationship and geopolitical situation with Trump coming to power? Pilger: I'm not a futurist; but Trump's clearly deliberate provocations on Taiwan and trade spell danger. I'm not suggesting he wants a war with China; but with the US military on China's doorstep with Aegis and THAAD missile systems, and saber-rattling rather than diplomacy the order of the day, there is a landscape of potential mistakes and accidents between the two countries. These are fragile times. "	12/13/16	0	0	-0.9956	-1
"Washington’s bargaining chip only bodes ill for TaiwannUS President-elect Donald Trump's recent phone call with Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen and his remarks bashing the Chinese mainland may have thrilled many in Taiwan temporarily, but they now have to realize that this may backfire. After Trump's provocative remarks on Taiwan, certain lawmakers from the Democratic Progressive Party have tried to seize the opportunity, proposing that Taiwan might not be bound by the one-China policy either. An Fengshan, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, stressed at a press conference Wednesday that Taiwan independence is a path to nowhere. On the question of opposing Taiwan independence and secession, China holds a firm will, sufficient confidence and enough capability. The separatists that advocate Taiwan's independence will find it uncomfortable if they put some vision and thoughts into what being a bargaining chip can incur - a disaster, not a blessing. The importance of the one-China policy in the three-way relationship of the mainland, Taiwan and the US can never be underestimated. It has been the cornerstone of cross-Straits peace for decades. Even the White House has had to emphasize more than once in the space of two weeks that the principle should be adhered to and not used as a bargaining chip with Beijing. The mainland has plenty of strong countermeasures, economically and militarily, against Trump playing the Taiwan card. Except from being a pawn, Taiwan is in no position to intervene in the confrontation between the US and the mainland, but it will suffer heavily if clashes take place between the two largest economies. Meanwhile, the mainland is fully capable of using economic tools if Taiwan authorities want to be used as a bargaining chip. The island has already suffered heavy losses from the plunge in mainland visitors to Taiwan, given the strained relationship after Tsai took office. According to reports, this year the number of mainland tourists to Taiwan decreased by 650,000, leading to a revenue drop of NT$35.5 billion ($1.12 billion). If the cross-Straits relationship worsens, investment in Taiwan will also be affected. In a lecture on Tuesday, former Taiwan leader Ma Ying-jeou said full consideration should be given to cross-Straits relations and Taiwan's ties with the US, and the two should never be used against each other. His clear-minded remarks need to be taken seriously. "	12/14/16	0	0	-0.9398	-1
"How should China respond to Trump's Taiwan card?nIllustration: Liu Rui/GT In an interview with Fox News Sunday, US President-elect Donald Trump questioned the One China policy while discussing his earlier telephone interactions with Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen. ""I don't know why we have to be bound by the One China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade,"" Trump said. How should China react to Trump's provocations, if not rhetoric? How will the remarks influence the Sino-US relationship? Global Times reporter Liu Jianxi talked with four experts on the issue. Shen Dingli, deputy dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University Trump was a pragmatic businessman, and is adept in the exchange of interests. The One China policy concerns China's sovereignty. ""Make America Great Again,"" meanwhile, is where US core interests lie. Therefore, Trump is attempting to use the Taiwan question as a bargaining chip to win more economic interests from China for his ""Make America Great Again"" ambition. From Trump's perspective, if Beijing takes a tough stance on trade and the economy, he will have no grounds to accept Beijing's sovereignty claims. He is pressuring China to make economic concessions. While the Sino-US diplomatic relationship was established on the basis of the One China policy in 1979, Beijing will definitely not break off diplomatic ties with Washington just because of Trump's remarks. Economic benefits are not our core interests, but the Taiwan question is. Issues minor to China may be major to the US, and vice versa. While Beijing prioritizes sovereignty over trade, an improved US economy is at the top of Trump's agenda. Compromises will be reached if both sides safeguard their core interests at the sacrifice of minor issues. Trump is astute to use the Taiwan question in exchange for economic gains. Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University The economy, especially trade with China, is what Trump cares about most. However, he has little to bargain with China at present, and therefore makes provocative remarks about China's Taiwan question to pressure the Asian giant for economic concessions. He has a pragmatic view of politics, and attempts to win maximum interests by every possible means. Trump will be disappointed. The Taiwan question, trade and the South China Sea disputes are three separate issues. We should not and will not link them together. China will, for sure, take countermeasures if Trump insists on his provocative words and deeds after taking office. For instance, against Trump's hope to expand exports to China, the Chinese side is free to cut its imports from the US, buying less Boeing airplanes, agricultural products, chemical and medical equipment. China's direct investments to the US, which is of vital importance to US manufacturing and employment, can also be reduced. China can dump or cut its holdings of US Treasury bonds as a retaliatory measure as well. Anyhow, China has a number of cards in hand to thwart Trump from reaching his selfish aims. Trump is highly likely to breach diplomatic traditions and principles, and make provocative speeches after taking office. China should be prepared for it. However, it should be noted that Trump, although an inexperienced politician with a big mouth, is a calculating and astute businessman, and is fully aware that confrontation, either economical or political, brings good to neither side. Despite the provocations, it is impossible to see confrontation or war in the future Sino-US relationship. Niu Xinchun, deputy director of the Institute of American Studies of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations Obviously, Trump's provocative remarks have seriously challenged the Sino-US relationship. The One China policy is a cornerstone and pillar of the relationship between Beijing and Washington since diplomatic ties were established in 1979. However, Trump's attempts to use the One China principle as a bargaining chip will subvert the overall relationship. While trade and the economy are negotiable, the One China policy has no room for negotiation. No matter whether Trump can meet his selfish ends, his unruly words and deeds are regarded by many observers, even in the US, as transactional and having broke decades of US diplomatic principles and traditions. His remarks have not only jeopardized world peace, but also upset the Beijing-Washington relationship. The power relationship has a basic framework, and subversion of it will have serious consequences. Trump is known for his unpredictability. Despite his provocative remarks on China, it is still hard to estimate his future China policy at the current stage. The Chinese side should let Trump know that his words and deeds will bring good to neither side, and he will pay for his mistakes. Liu Weidong, a research fellow at the Institute of American Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Trump was known for his defiance of principle during his election campaign. He despises not only principles -- regarding the Taiwan question -- but also his predecessor's rules on China and the Sino-US relationship. For instance, while Barack Obama has reiterated the necessity of China obeying international rules, Trump has never made similar remarks. Trump prioritizes practical interests over principles. As a pragmatic businessman, Trump is bold at the exchange of interests. He is attempting to use the One China policy as a bargaining chip to win more economic benefits. Frankly speaking, the US still has the upper hand in its relationship with China, and thus Beijing will have little choice but to accept Trump's economic requests. Trump is an immature politician, and has not realized the serious consequences that his provocative remarks may cause to the Sino-US relationship. He views and comments on foreign affairs any way he likes. Time is needed for him to adapt to his new post. The Chinese side has reacted to Trump's provocations in a proper manner. As Trump has not officially taken office, there is no need for the Chinese side to overreact to his remarks. Regarding the Taiwan question, Trump does not care much about the One China policy. On the one hand, he may lift some restraints on arms sales, and sell more advanced weapons to Taiwan after taking office. On the other, he is not quite enthusiastic about involving himself in cross-Straits issue, which brings little benefit to the US. Trump honors ""America First,"" and will not put much effort on agendas that bring no immediate interests to him. Strategic contraction is highly likely to be his first choice in security. It should be noted that, although Trump may sell more weapons to Taiwan, he will disregard Tsai's call for help. Trump doesn't want to be bothered by Tsai and her own businesses. Forming a new government is now the urgent task for Trump. After coming to office, he will prioritize domestic issues over the relationship with China. Chinese public opinion, as a whole, believes that Trump's being elected is better than Hillary Clinton's for China. It now seems that observers and the public were too optimistic about Trump's future policy. The president-elect is attempting to win more economic gains by lowering China's expectations of him. However, Trump's provocative remarks do not mean that he wants to launch a trade or military war with China, which will only result in a lose-lose situation. "	12/12/16	1	1	0.9952	1
"Expect more offshore training: expertsnChinese experts said offshore training does not violate international law and will occur more regularly, after two Japanese F-15 fighters fired decoy flares at Chinese military aircraft engaged in routine training over the Miyako Strait on Saturday. Taiwan's ""Ministry of Defense"" said on Saturday that more than ten military aircraft from the mainland crossed the Miyako Strait and four intelligence airplanes headed to the south and crossed Bashi Strait. On November 25, a week before the phone call between US president-elect Donald Trump and Taiwan's leader Tsai Ing-wen, Chinese Air Force planes were also involved in training exercises over the Miyako Strait between southwest Japan and Taiwan. This type of training is expected to occur more regularly, because in order to break through the First Island Chain, offshore training in the West Pacific Ocean is a compulsory mission for the Chinese Air Force, Li Jie, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times. The training exercises prove our military planes, include intelligence aircraft, fighters and bombers can easily appear east of Taiwan, ""so even if Taiwan decides to go independent, the mainland military forces have the capacity to solve the problem,"" Li said. Since Trump's election, the situation in the West Pacific has become more uncertain. ""Although the mainland Air Force annual training has become routine, it delivered a tough message to Tsai's regime which deem Trump may strengthen its move toward 'Taiwan independence.' It also sent a message to Japan, which wants to push militarization and a greater security burden for the US to contain China,"" Li said. China's defense ministry spokesperson Yang Yujun criticized Japan on Saturday, saying the Miyako Strait incident was dangerous and unprofessional. China is gravely concerned about the incident and has made solemn representations, he explained. Yang also said it's necessary to stress that in recent years, interference by Japanese ships have led to misunderstandings and misjudgments, as well as friction and conflict in the air and sea, urging Japan to value regional stability and bilateral ties, and take effective measures to prevent incidents that would threaten air and sea safety. ""The training didn't intrude Japanese airspace, and it was in accordance with international law which allows free navigation and overflight in the relevant air zone,"" Li stressed. ""There is no reason for Japan to send fighter jets to disrupt our training mission,"" said Li, adding that ""Japan has to stop its hostility and get used to China's routine offshore training.""

"Trump-linked former US official visits TaiwannA former senior US official with links to Donald Trump 's transition team flew to Taipei Tuesday, sparking more speculation over relations with Taiwan after the president-elect's unprecedented call with the island's leader.Stephen Yates, once a deputy national security advisor to former US vice president Dick Cheney, told journalists he was making a long-planned personal trip but did not rule out meetings with Taiwan officials.Tsai Ing-wen's call to Trump on Friday was the first between a Taiwan leader and an incoming or serving US president since Washington switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.The White House said on Monday it had sought to reassure China after Trump's phone call, which the Obama administration warned could undermine progress in relations with Beijing.White House spokesman Josh Earnest said senior National Security Council officials spoke twice with Chinese officials over the weekend to reassure them of Washington's commitment to the ""One China"" policy and to ""reiterate and clarify the continued commitment of the United States to our longstanding China policy.""Earlier on Monday, China's Foreign Ministry said Trump was clear about China's position on the Taiwan question and that China had maintained contacts with his team.Chinese netizens have criticized Trump's ""inexperience"" and berated the president-elect for his scant knowledge by tweeting on Monday that the US disagrees with China's construction activities in the South China Sea.Despite tensions over matters ranging from trade to China's territorial claims in the South China Sea, the Obama administration has highlighted US-China cooperation on global issues, such as climate change and Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programs.Local media reported Yates was set to meet Tsai but her office said it was not aware of any appointment.Media have also described Yates, who speaks fluent Mandarin, as a key adviser on Taiwan for Trump's camp.Yates denied that he represented the Trump administration but said he speaks ""with friends in the transition from time to time, in confidence.""He said he had not been approached for a position in the new administration, but had ""several informal discussions with friends working for the transition.""

"PLA jets circled Taiwan: officialnTaiwan defense officials confirmed on Monday that several fighter jets of the People's Liberation Army flew over the Bashi Channel and Miyako Strait last month during a drill in the Western Pacific Ocean, the first time PLA fighter jets have done so.The PLA dispatched H-6 bombers, electronic reconnaissance jets and Su-30 fighter bombers to join a drill in the Western Pacific on November 25, according to earlier media reports.The Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee of Taiwan's ""legislature"" asked the island's defense and security agencies to report the incident on Monday. A defense official said he was not surprised since the PLA has the capability to carry out the mission, and that there is no need to adjust Taiwan's response strategies.Media reports said the PLA flew near Taiwan's flight information region (FIR) three times in September, October and November. Taiwan's defense authorities, however, counted more than three times, though the jets didn't enter its air defense identification zone.The official noted such flying missions began in 2013 and the drills were carried out 1,000 kilometers from what China refers to as the first island chain, therefore the PLA had other targets in mind than Taiwan.Global Times "	12/6/16	0	0	0.8193	1

"Govt moves threaten Taiwan economynPerformers from Taiwan perform traditional dance at a trade fair in Weifang, East China's Shandong Province in September. Photo: CFP The economy in Taiwan could face trouble and business from the island could be under pressure as the government under pro-independence leader Tsai Ing-wen seeks to reduce its dependence on the Chinese mainland but offers no effective solutions, business representatives and experts said on Sunday. The comments come after Tsai's phone conversation with US President-elect Donald Trump on Friday, which has drawn controversy over the weekend. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described the call as ""a trick of the Taiwan side"" that won't change the international consensus that there is only one China. The phone call itself will not affect the economic ties between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, but the move is seen as part of Tsai's drive to alienate Taiwan from the mainland, which is impossible and could further jeopardize cross-Straits business ties, experts pointed out. ""No matter how much [Tsai] wants to reduce the economic dependence on the mainland, she is acting like the Monkey King in the Chinese classic Journey to the West, who can never escape from the Buddha's palm,"" said Xue Qingde, a Taiwan businessman who has been investing for over a decade in Pingtan, East China's Fujian Province. Xue, the president of a department store in Pingtan and leader of a local association of Taiwan businessmen, said that he has seen changes in the economic relationship between the mainland and the island. Decline in trade From January to October, the total volume of cross-Straits trade slumped 6.1 percent on a year-on-year basis to $144 billion. At the same time exports from the mainland to Taiwan dropped 12.6 percent to $32.6 billion while imports from the island decreased 4 percent to $111 billion, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a post published on Wednesday. Though the shrinking trade volume between the mainland and the island is due to the global trade downturn, political pressure could impact some sectors, said Zhai Suoling, president of the Dongguan Taiwan-funded Enterprises Association. ""Political pressure will affect non-official activities, for example, tourism, but not exports and imports as integrated supply chains have been established for years,"" he told the Global Times on Sunday. A halted cross-Straits communication mechanism also affected building platforms to improve communication and cooperation, said Zhang Guanhua, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""The export-driven business model has been losing momentum in recent years, but [Tsai's] refusal to affirm the 1992 Consensus has made new cooperation in services and industry innovation unlikely,"" he told the Global Times on Sunday. 'Leading nowhere' Xue, the Taiwan businessman, said instead of fixing issues in the economy, ""Tsai's administration's efforts of promoting a so-called New Southbound Policy are leading nowhere."" The New Southbound Policy was designed to strengthen the island's trade and economic ties with member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as well as with New Zealand and Australia. The policy is considered the follow-up to Taiwan's former leader Chen Shui-bian's proposal to reduce Taiwan's reliance on the mainland. They may attract some pro-independence ""green camp"" enterprises, especially as labor costs in the mainland have been rising in recent years, Dai Shugeng, a professor of economics at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Sunday. ""Considering the competition that Taiwan firms will face in ASEAN countries, for example Vietnam, where an increasing number of companies from the mainland have established affiliates, moving south does not necessarily mean success,"" he said. Although Tsai has suggested that Taiwan companies should tap into new markets in Southeast Asia, not many have followed the proposal, business representatives said Sunday. ""Many of my friends and business partners told me that they can't see where Tsai leads us to,"" Xue said, adding that leaving the world's second-largest market is not a wise decision. The number of tourists from the mainland to Taiwan has slumped about 50 percent on a year-on-year basis during the week-long National Day holidays this year, according to media reports. ""Those employees in the tourism sector in Taiwan are the first ones affected by this changing relationship,"" Zhai noted. The Taiwan economy will pay much more of a price if Tsai's administration continues to lean toward the US and Japan and alienates the island from the mainland, particularly when the mainland is still the largest market of export for Taiwan, Zhang said.

"Talk to Trump, punish Tsai administrationnUS President-elect Donald Trump 's spokesperson Kellyanne Conway came to Trump's defense over the issue of his phone call with Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen, telling CNN that he is ""fully briefed and fully knowledgeable about these issues."" Meanwhile, Tsai's spokesperson Alex Huang told NBC News that ""Maintaining good relations with the United States is as important as maintaining good relations across the Taiwan Straits.""The Trump-Tsai phone call has rocked and confounded the world. All US mainstream media have pointed out that the Taiwan question is among the most sensitive issues in East Asia, and any mishandling of it could lead to war. Trump's jaw-dropping move has raised many doubts about whether it is in line with the US' long-term interests.It seems that Trump is still taking advantage of his perceived fickleness and unpredictability to make some choppy waves in the Taiwan Straits to see if he can gain some bargaining chips before he is sworn in.The US is losing its competitive advantage against China, to say nothing of acquiring new leverage. Trump might be looking for some opportunities by making waves. However, he has zero diplomatic experience and is unaware of the repercussions of shaking up Sino-US relations.It is certain that Trump doesn't want a showdown with China, because it is not his ambition, and neither was it included in his promise to the electorate. He puts out feelers to sound China out and chalk up some petty benefits.China should understand Trump has two faces. On the one hand, he is bluffing and unpredictable, and on the other, he has no plan to overturn international relationships, and will focus on US internal affairs to ""make America great again."" China should become skillful and tactful in dealing with the Trump government.China has solemnly protested about Trump's recklessness, and it should do more. It is inappropriate to target Trump since he is still a president-elect. China can punish the Tsai administration, as a way to convey a message to Trump. The Chinese mainland can let Taiwan lose one or two diplomatic allies as a punishment as well as a warning. The mainland can also strengthen its military deployment based on Anti-Secession Law against Taiwan in case of its independence.At worst, Trump might retaliate by raising political and even military tensions with China, which could give the US leverage to force China to concede more economic benefits. China shouldn't let the US gain extra economic advantages by unfair means.China's response to Trump's instigation of the Taiwan question should be a lesson for him. However, despite these tit-for-tat measures, it is best to engage in constructive conversations with him. China must note that dealing with Trump requires multiple instruments in many aspects. We need to be clear-minded. "	12/4/16	0	1	0.8991	1
"Trump tweets spark concerns of rise in US arms sales to TaiwannGraphics:GT US President-elect Donald Trump's tweets about US arms sales after his protocol-breaking phone call with Taiwan's leader has spurred speculation that Trump may increase arms sales to the island, with Chinese analysts warning that the negative consequences would outweigh any profits. Analysts also believe that the military gap between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan is too big to be filled by any US arms sales, and selling weapons to Taiwan is still viewed as an offensive political act from the US to interfere in China's domestic policy. Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen on Friday spoke on the phone with Trump, offering her congratulations on his election victory, the first direct phone call between a US president-elect and a Taiwan leader since mainland and the US established diplomatic ties in 1979. Trump also called Tsai ""the President of Taiwan"" in a tweet, adding ""interesting how the US sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call."" Tricky subject Yang Lixian, a researcher at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times said that it is possible that Trump would see economic benefits in increasing arms sales to Taiwan. ""The Taiwan question is one of the most sensitive and tricky subjects of the Sino-US relationship,"" Yang said, adding that if handled inappropriately, it will cause irreversible damage. Yang said that the Chinese mainland should remain firm in its attitude to object to any US arms sales to Taiwan, and make preparations for any possible adjustment to these sales. Peng Guangqian, a military strategist at the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Academy of Military Science, told the Global Times on Sunday that the defensive capability of the Chinese mainland has overwhelmingly surpassed Taiwan in the past 10 years. ""Nowadays, we can observe a hostile aircraft carrier any time, and the mainland would have the home advantage if a conflict breaks out in the Taiwan Straits today,"" Zhang Junshe, a senior researcher at the PLA Naval Military Studies Research Institute, told the Global Times. US military exports to Taiwan are merely a political act to demonstrate US hegemony in Asia and is a sharp practice on the part of the US, Peng said. ""Taiwan has purchased low-quality and less-advanced US weaponry at an extremely high price,"" Peng said. The US has not and will not sell top-notch weapons to Taiwan, and China's objection has also affected their weapons trade, he said. ""Sadly for Taiwan, even if Taiwan bought some high-tech weapons from the US, in some cases, they wouldn't even be able to see or touch the weapons, since the US doesn't trust Taiwan's military with protected secrets,"" Peng noted. Military exchanges According to the Taipei Times, Taiwan's ""Ministry of Foreign Affairs"" last week welcomed the call by the US Senate and House of Representatives for military exchanges between senior Taiwan and US officials in the US National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) in 2017, expressing gratitude to the US Congress for its continuous efforts in promoting military cooperation between Taiwan and the US. Even if Congress passes the act, the US president has the right to veto it, Peng said. ""However, the act will certainly disturb the Sino-US relationship if it's implemented,"" Peng said. The US may not suspend its arms sales to Taiwan after Trump takes office, Li Fei, a professor with the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University told the Global Times. However, once the Sino-US relations are affected, the US will lose more than the profit they make out of the arms sales, Li noted. "	12/4/16	0	0	-0.968	-1
"Trump’s Taiwan phone call won’t change US’ One-China principle: China's FMnThe phone call between US president-elect Donald Trump and Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen will not change Washington's One-China principle, said Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday. The phone call was ""a trick of the Taiwanese side"" and won't change the international consensus that there is only one China, Wang responded during an interview after the Symposium on the International Development and China’s Diplomacy in 2016. Wang added that the phone call won't change the one-China principle the US has adhered to for years. ""The one-China principle is the cornerstone of Sino-US relations and we don't want to see the political principle be disrupted or damaged,"" said Wang. Trump spoke with Tsai, who offered her congratulations on his election victory, according to a statement of Trump' transition team. The call marks the first between a US president or president-elect and a Taiwan leader since 1979. ""The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!"" tweeted Trump. About an hour later, he responded to the reactions generated by his first post. ""Interesting how the US sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call,"" he posted.

Wang Chong, deputy secretary of Beijing-based Charhar Institute echoed the ministry in saying the call will not change the long-standing recognition of a “one-China” by the US. ""For Trump’s lack of political experience, this can be a test for him on how to handle the Taiwan issue. And he did try to clarify himself after the media uproar,"" said Wang. Wang Chong suggested that Tsai wanted to cozy up to Trump after the election. ""She might have misunderstood the situation,"" said Wang Chong.

"KMT leader’s visit shows Taiwanese a viable option: expertsnKMT leader’s visit shows Taiwanese a viable option: experts The ongoing visit to the Chinese mainland of the leader of Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) Party will reaffirm the one-China policy and show Taiwan people an option in boosting their island's staggering economy when the approval rating of their leader drops, experts said. Hung Hsiu-chu arrived in Nanjing, East China's Jiangsu Province and is scheduled to visit Nanjing and Beijing from Sunday to Thursday. Before leaving Taipei, she told reporters on Sunday that her trip aims to promote stability and peace across the Taiwan Straits, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Sunday. The KMT firmly opposes ""Taiwan independence"" and hopes to maintain cross-Straits peace, she said, adding that it is her party's consensus. ""Hung's visit to the Chinese mainland and meeting with the Communist Party of China (CPC) leaders will reaffirm the KMT Party's firm stance on the one-China policy, considering there was some opposition within the party after its defeat in Taiwan's leadership election in May,"" Liu Xiangping, head of the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Nanjing University, told the Global Times. The reaffirmation will also show the Taiwan people another way to enhance their lives, especially with many of them dissatisfied with island leader Tsai Ing-wen's economic policies, Hu Benliang, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. The bi-monthly poll conducted by Taiwan Indicators Survey Research, showed that 48 percent disapprove of her performance, an increase of two percentage points from the first half of October, compared to 35 percent who approve, Taiwan-based Central News Agency reported. Thousands of tourism industry workers staged a rally in Taiwan in early September, demanding the government address a slump in the mainland visitors following the deterioration in cross-Straits ties after the election, AFP reported. On Monday, Hung paid tribute to KMT founder Sun Yat-sen at his mausoleum in Nanjing. November 12 marks the 150th birth anniversary of Sun. Sun, who dedicated his life to rejuvenating the Chinese nation and improving people's lives, is a bond between the CPC and KMT, inspiring both parties to promote peace and development, which cannot be fully realized without reunification across the Straits, Liu said.

Hung, who leads a delegation from the island, is scheduled to visit Nanjing and Beijing from Oct. 30 to Nov. 3. Before leaving Taipei, Hung told reporters at the Taoyuan International Airport that it will be a trip aiming to promote stability and peace across the Taiwan Strait. The KMT firmly opposes ""Taiwan independence"" and hopes to maintain peace across the Strait, she said, adding that it is the consensus of the party. She hoped the basis for mutual trust across the Strait could be strengthened. Since the Democratic Progressive Party took power on May 20, the KMT has been willing to continue to boost non-governmental exchanges across the Strait, said Hung. Tsai Cheng-yuan, executive director of the KMT's Policy Committee, told a press conference on Sunday morning that Hung will follow the historic path laid out by her predecessors to create a stable architecture for cross-Strait interactions, adding that the KMT hopes for a smooth and successful visit.

"Business is buzzingnA beekeeper holds a hive before collecting the honey at a bee farm in Yilan on October 4. Photo: AFP Under a shady starfruit tree Taiwanese beekeeper Jiang Hwan-bin tends his hives, pumping out pure honey for a rapidly growing market of health-conscious consumers.Jiang's family has been keeping bees for 80 years and he now manages 500 hives in the northwest county of Hsinchu.In total his family runs around 2,000 hives across northern Taiwan.A string of food safety scandals in Taiwan has driven demand for clean, traceable produce, with pure honey seen as particularly ­beneficial - whether stirred into water as a summer thirst-quencher or used as a sugar substitute in desserts.But although the island's appetite is voracious and outstrips supply, which keeps prices high, ­beekeepers say it is hard to fully capitalize as climate change and disease hamper ­expansion.This year alone saw a series of ­typhoons and an unusually cold ­January affecting early blossoms.Jiang, 54, who sells most of his produce through his shop in Hsinchu city under the name ""Ah-bin Pure Honey,"" says his production fell 30 percent due to the adverse conditions.The situation for the whole family is even worse: Overall production across the thousands of hives they run has dropped by two-thirds, he says.The unpredictability of the seasons is reflected in island-wide honey output over the past five years.Taiwan produced 11,726 tons of pure honey in 2015, more than ­doubling in a decade, with the ­number of bee farms going up by over a fifth to 860.The industry is worth NT$2.7 ­billion ($85.9 million) annually.But production has been unstable since 2011, when it peaked at 15,000 tons, with extreme weather a major factor.Jiang says his fundamental focus is now disaster prevention.""We prepare for everything as much as we can,"" he said.""What we can do is manage the bees well and do our best to keep more bees. The rest depends on the weather.""Disease problems troubling beekeepers around the world have also taken their toll on Jiang's stock.In 2005 he saw half his bees wiped out by a bacterial infection.He quarantined his queens, burned the infected frames from his hives, and started again, sharing those hard lessons with other local ­beekeepers.The government says it is also ­giving bee farmers advice on disease prevention and violent weather swings.""In Taiwan, climate change has been huge,"" says Wu Tzu-hsien, a ­senior apiculture expert for the ­government's agriculture ministry.""If the changes are too extreme, bees cannot control their body ­temperature and die.""In rural Yilan county in the northeast of Taiwan the ""Bee Farmer"" cafe and education ­center sits against a backdrop of misty mountains.Giant bee statues greet visitors, who buy everything from royal jelly to pollen sachets at the store inside.There is a honey museum and active hives to teach the public about bees.Visitors come mainly from ­Taiwan, although some from Hong Kong and Singapore also drop in.The business belongs to Huang Tung-ming, a fourth generation bee farmer who manages 300 hives in the area, producing a variety of honeys, including longan, lychee and melon.He has diversified to prosper, selling produce from other local bee farmers as well as his own.There are 10 ""Bee Farmer"" shops around Taiwan but the company sells mostly online through its Chinese-­language website, a more modern ­approach than most ­traditional ­beekeeping ­families.The ­business brings in NT$50 ­million each year.""In the past, ­farming villages were ­isolated. When you produced honey you didn't know where the ­customers were,"" says Huang.""Now with the Internet, with branding, packaging and a ­corporate image, it's much easier than before.""Building a bee brand has helped Huang offset the ­challenges of bad weather and bee health, both of which have affected his farms.Eight years ago, many of Huang's bees deserted their hives, unable to find their way home after going out for nectar.Huang, 61, believes inbreeding affected the bees' sense of direction and has since developed a method of isolating the best pairs.That has meant his hives have not succumbed to illnesses that have killed so many bees worldwide, he says.Despite the pressures, his son Huang Chun-yen, 33, who helps run the business, says there are still keen young bee farmers who consider it a good option in the face of Taiwan's economic stagnation.""Young people can't find jobs that pay well,"" he says.""As the value of bee products is high, young people go to farming villages to learn to keep bees and develop their careers.""For Jiang in Hsinchu, looking after bees means more than just business.He sees it as a global issue, key to environmental protection and food provision.""Almost one third of human food relies on bee pollination. Bees play an important role in the ecosystem,"" he says.Meanwhile, he does his best to defend his own hives against whatever nature throws at them.""We believe we have to work hard first, and then Heaven will help us,"" he says.

"As Taiwan economy stagnates, some youth head across straits for opportunitiesnDespite the strained relations between the mainland and Taiwan since Tsai Ing-wen took office this May, many Taiwan young people are now coming to the mainland to seek a better future. They find more opportunities, but also face fierce competition. A Taiwan resident displays her Taiwan Compatriot Permit upon arriving in the mainland in Qingdao, Shandong Province. Photo: IC After obtaining a master's in finance from Peking University this July, Chen Min-ping from Taiwan decided to stay in Beijing to build her career. She managed to find a job as a researcher at a private equity fund, where her main role is to recommend stocks to clients. ""The financial industry in Taiwan lags behind the mainland which is now blooming. Taiwan's financial industry is almost saturated, giving graduates majoring in finance very limited job choices,"" Chen told the Global Times. For her, the decision to stay in Beijing was quite straightforward as the mainland can provide her more working possibilities. Finance industry heavyweights like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase only hire a handful of people in Taiwan each year. While in the mainland, things are different, she said. ""Although the competition here is so fierce, the opportunities are greater. I see many Taiwan people have found pretty good jobs here,"" she said. Currently around a million Taiwanese people work on the mainland. Since Tsai Ing-wen became Taiwan leader this May, the cross-Straits political relationship has become strained. There has also been a remarkable slump in the number of mainland tourists going to Taiwan. But deteriorating cross-Straits ties haven't influenced young people's choices, some of whom, like Chen, see a future for themselves on the mainland. Meanwhile, the central government has issued a series of polices favoring Taiwan youth who want to seek a career in the mainland. Recently, the government of Yantan, Shandong Province established a basement as a space for Taiwan youth to set up new businesses. A combination of pictures of Taipei (left) and Shanghai Think bigger Chen first came to the mainland in 2004 on a trip with her family. At that time, the impression she had of the mainland was that is was ""uncivilized, in disarray and had shabby infrastructure."" But when she revisited Beijing in 2012 as an exchange student at a Beijing college, she realized the ""Guomao central business district has greatly surpassed Taipei 101 (a landmark skyscraper in Taiwan)."" ""The mainland has progressed so fast and it has surpassed Taiwan in many fields. The development of the Internet and various mobile applications have totally transformed people's way of living, providing a convenience that is hard to imagine back in Taiwan,"" she said. According to Chen, besides the mainland, many Taiwan youth also choose to go to Hong Kong for work. But for Chen, the goal is clear: staying on the mainland and climbing the social ladder. ""Man struggles upwards, water flows downwards. This is a natural phenomenon"" Wang Jianmin, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. ""The Taiwan economy is now stagnating and it is finding it hard to absorb so many talents."" In the early 1990s, Taiwan encouraged mainland talents to come to Taiwan to help develop the island. Later this route was cut off when the administration became ""alert"" toward the mainland. But this barricade not only restrained Taiwan's development but also pushed more Taiwan talents to head to the outside world, Wang explained. ""Working on the mainland is an inevitable trend and is the choice of Taiwan people,"" he added. In 1995, a fresh graduate from a Taiwan university could expect a monthly salary of NT$30,000 ($953) on average but 21 years later, this has decreased to NT$25,000. In the late 1970s and 1980s, the mainland government encouraged Taiwanese to come the mainland, and cross-Straits trade began. In 2005, after Lien Chan, former chairman of the Kuomintang, paid a visit to the mainland, the exchange of talents warmed up. Afterwards, many Taiwan scholars came to teach in the mainland. In the last three years, favorable policies have tried to lure more Taiwan youth to the mainland. So far the mainland has set up nearly 40 bases targeting Taiwan youth to help them set up businesses and foster innovation exchanges. Besides settling down in first-tier cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the Global Times found out that some Taiwan youth are now choosing to work in medium-sized cities. Fierce competition This June, the Chinese Youth Development Union, an organization dedicated to pushing forward cross-Straits cooperation and assisting young people to find work and set up businesses was established in Taipei. Right after its founding, it cooperated with the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on a program of summer internships at Beijing companies. They selected 13 outstanding Taiwan students to work in Beijing for one month, to help them accumulate work experience and build professional networks. The internships covered several industries including Internet technology, banking, wedding planning and training institutions. Lo Wen-chun, a student majoring in international and Chinese mainland affairs at National Quemoy University, got an internship as an external communication worker at a wedding company. Lo expressed her regrets to the Global Times that she couldn't choose an internship that fits her major because she was ""too late"" to the program. ""All the good jobs had been swept away by others. So I had no choice,"" she told the Global Times via WeChat from Taiwan. Lo recalled that in that month, she had to walk across Beijing's big streets and small alleys under the roasting sun and very often she had no time to even drink. The work was drudgery but she didn't dare to neglect her duties. ""The competition in Beijing is too fierce with so many talents accumulating here. The city has a larger population than Taiwan. I have no choice but to push my limits,"" she stressed. Lo plans to return to Beijing after graduation to find a job. ""I'm not expecting a good first job. I just want one (to stay in Beijing),"" she said. Currently Taiwan people who work on the mainland can have healthcare, employment, buy property, open bank accounts and receive financing, with their Taiwan compatriot permit. Unification is the only way During their interviews, those Taiwan youth were either intentionally or unintentionally evading political questions. Due to their education, their values are quite different from the older Taiwan generations and they're unwilling to express a political stance. A Taiwan man, who didn't want to give his name, told the Global Times that the mainland doesn't understand why Taiwan doesn't want unification. But some Taiwanese also don't understand why the mainland wants unification. He pointed out that many young people in Taiwan find the idea that ""Taiwan is merely a province of China"" to be unacceptable. He said that he thinks the phenomenon of young Taiwan people working on the mainland is beneficial. No matter what is driving them to the mainland, they can have the chance to learn about the mainland and will see cross-Straits questions more objectively if they have worked and lived on the mainland. Chen told the Global Times that the major reason that young Taiwan residents reject unification is they are afraid of losing the island's political system. But if unification can bring economic revival to Taiwan, she believes losing some democracy is acceptable. An experienced worker in the media industry in Taiwan told the Global Times that she is envious of the One Belt and One Road conception and the fact that from top to bottom, mainland society can be united into one force. ""In Taiwan, no matter what is proposed, there are people jumping out and fighting relentlessly. Eventually, nothing is done,"" she said. Liu Chi-tsung, 17, is a high school senior. He plans to study business on the mainland. ""Taiwan's population is small and lacks competence. Staying here I will just swim with the tide. Should I wait to be washed away into the Taiwan Strait?"" he questioned. Many government programs in Taiwan have stagnated due to a lack of funding. ""Seeing my hometown turn into a 'ghost city' makes me feel sad. So I hope through studying and working on the mainland, I can make a breakthrough, bringing in mainland capital to boost Taiwan's economy,"" he said. Wang Jianmin said that Taiwan people working on the mainland are good for improving cross-Straits relations and helping Taiwan reflect on its own problems. In the past Taiwan's young people resisted coming to the mainland and they had a shallow and one-sided understanding of the mainland. When they come to work on the mainland they can experience the support that the mainland gives to Taiwan and then realize the importance of peaceful development. Now Taiwan people haven't fully realized the harmfulness of ""Taiwan independence."" ""When they're awake, they will find out that unification is the only outlet for Taiwan and it's the pursuit of the Taiwan people,"" Wang said. "	10/19/16	0	0	0.9985	1
"Equal treatment to Taiwan people should be premised on cross-Straits unity: expertnGranting the Taiwan people equal treatment with locals during their stay on the Chinese mainland is necessary, but policies should be made with caution and premised on the one-China principle, an expert said. The State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office is drafting a document to grant Taiwan people several equal treatments with locals, such as permission to live in all the hotels during their stay and access to all the scholarships when studying in mainland universities, the Taiwan-based chinatimes.com reported Friday. An official with the information office of the Taiwan Affairs Office said that they have no information about the issue and refused for further comment when reached by the Global Times on Friday. ""Many Taiwan people have expressed such expectations and the policy is necessary as it can bring more convenience to the life of thousands of Taiwan people on the mainland,"" Yang Lixian, deputy secretary-general of the National Society of Taiwan Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Friday. More importantly, it helps bring a sense of belonging as a Chinese national, said Yang. However, such policy should be made cautiously and announced at a proper time, Yang noted, adding that the premise to enjoy equal treatment lies in acknowledging the one-China principle. Several policies to facilitate the Taiwan people's entry into and stay on the mainland have been issued in recent years, including a policy to allow Taiwan residents to enter the mainland just with their mainland travel permit.

"Mainland slams Taiwan leader’s speechnA Chinese mainland spokesperson for cross-Straits affairs slammed Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen's Monday speech, saying it is a dead-end to deny the 1992 Consensus, incite confrontation and cut economic and cultural ties across the Straits. ""The two sides across the Straits can only negotiate and interact if Taiwan recognizes the 1992 Consensus and adheres to its core meaning,"" An Fengshan, spokesman of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said in a statement published on the official website on Monday. The 1992 Consensus and the one-China principle it embodies are in accordance with the juridical logic and reality of the cross-Straits relations as well as the cornerstone that ensures the peaceful development of the relations, An said, adding that the ""goodwill"" of the island's leadership lies in whether it accepts the 1992 Consensus. An reiterated the mainland's sincerity and goodwill in improving cross-Straits ties based on the 1992 Consensus remain unchanged, and will resolutely oppose acts to create ""Taiwan independence."" Tsai said in the speech that ""our pledges will not change, and our goodwill will not change. But we will not bow to pressure, and we will, of course, not revert to the old path of confrontation. This is our fundamental attitude toward maintaining the status quo, and it is based on the collective hope for peace across the Taiwan Straits."" She called upon the Chinese mainland authorities to ""face up to the reality that the Republic of China exists."" Zhang Wensheng, a research fellow at Xiamen University, told the Global Times that the mainland could not feel any ""goodwill"" without the recognition of the one-China principle. ""Tsai's speech has nothing new and she was actually using the idea of 'two countries' to confront the principle,"" Zhang said. ""It is a good time for Tsai to improve cross-Straits ties. However, she missed the chance and will possibly drag the relationship back to confrontation,"" said Zhang Hua, an assistant research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Tsai's speech to promote the cross-Straits relationship is only another disguise for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to promote ""Taiwan independence,"" said Chang Ya-chung, a political professor at Taiwan University. ""Tsai wants to seek a balance between pro-independence groups within the DPP and the Chinese mainland, but she failed and hurt the cross-Straits relations as well as the interests of Taiwan,"" Zhang Hua said, referring to a sharp decline in the number of tourists from the mainland to Taiwan since Tsai took office and Taiwan's absence at an assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization held in Montreal, Canada on September 27. Zhang noted that it is impossible for Taiwan to seek support from the US and Japan on the Taiwan question because the two countries would prioritize their cooperation with the mainland on economic and global affairs over Taiwan.

"Mainland says Taiwan shut itself out of intl aviation conferencenThe prerequisite for Taiwan to participate in any international activity is adherence to the one-China policy, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Friday. Spokesperson Lu Kang's remarks came after the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), an organization under the framework of the United Nations, decided not to invite Taiwan to participate in its assembly in Canada, the Xinhua News Agency reported. Only sovereign states have the right to participate in institutions and activities within the UN framework, Lu said while answering questions. Taiwan, as an inalienable part of China, has no right to participate in the ICAO assembly, he added. On the same day, spokesman for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office Ma Xiaoguang said that the reason that Taiwan cannot participate in the ICAO assembly is that Taiwan's current Democratic Progressive Party administration refuses to recognize the 1992 Consensus, which endorses the one-China policy, according to Xinhua. Lee Ta-wei, head of the Taiwan ""foreign affairs department,"" earlier on Friday said that the department did not receive the invitation from the ICAO, and charged that it was due to ""unreasonable suppression"" from the Chinese mainland, the Taiwan-based news website ettoday.net reported. Lee said he felt ""extremely out of sorts"" about the Chinese mainland. ""The international society recognizes China's legal position in representing China, and Taiwan itself has no qualification to participate in international affairs and activities for sovereign states,"" Lü Cuncheng, a Beijing-based Taiwan studies expert, told the Global Times on Friday. Civil aviation authorities from Taiwan were invited to send staff as non-voting delegates to attend the ICAO Assembly's 38th session in 2013, after the mainland and Taiwan exchanged views on this issue, according to Xinhua. The DPP authorities should rethink what allowed Taiwan to attend the assembly in 2013 and what made it not in 2016, instead of accusing the Chinese mainland and misleading the public, Ma said. ""The policy of Chinese mainland to Taiwan did not change since Tsai Ing-wen came to power, so the retrogression of the cross-Straits relations and the narrowing of international space could be blamed on the DPP's behavior and attitude,"" Lü said.

"Retro Taiwan lunchboxes cash in on train nostalgianRetro Taiwan lunchboxes cash in on train nostalgia Once served as no-frills sustenance for train passengers in Taiwan, simple rice lunchboxes are selling in their millions across the island, a food trend fueled by nostalgia. Known as railway biandang, which means ""convenience"" in Chinese, the meals have changed little over the decades. Traditionally a pragmatic combination of braised or fried meat and pickles piled onto steamed white rice - ingredients designed to endure long train journeys - they are now seen as an enduring symbol of the ""good old days,"" when rail travel trumped planes and cars. While they used to be the preserve of passengers looking for a low-cost meal, now fans are picking them up as comfort food, whether they are taking a journey or not. ""It reminds me of when I was little, when I would take the train to Yilan with my family,"" said a 42-year-old woman surnamed Chang, buying boxes of classic pork chop rice from a shop at a Taipei station to take home. Chang estimates she eats a railway style lunchbox about 10 times a month, making a point to buy one whenever she is passing a station. Although there are now fancier, pricier, lunchboxes containing everything from red quinoa rice to rosemary chicken, Chang still prefers the traditional combination. ""It's just tastier - the rice tastes better,"" she said. The Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) expects to sell a record 10 million of the popular lunchboxes this year, pulling in roughly NT$700 million ($22.4 million). The TRA still sells the biandang on trains and in stations - trolleys wend their way through carriages, or passengers can order them in advance. Private vendors are also cashing in, running their own kiosks in or nearby stations, while convenience store chains now sell ""railway style"" lunchboxes too. Originally presented in round metal tins placed under seats for collection when finished, they now usually come in simple paper or wooden containers. The TRA's most popular box is the simple pork chop rice, says Michael Lee, deputy general manager of its food and services division. As well as a nostalgia hit, price is still a major draw - the classic combo costs just NT$60. ""Like our ticket prices, our biandang prices haven't increased for many years,"" Lee said. The name biandang is thought to come from the Japanese ""bento,"" used to describe a lunchbox with various ingredients. Japan built much of Taiwan's railways during its half-century rule of the island, which ended with its defeat in World War II. While more than 230 million people still travel by train in Taiwan each year, increased plane and car travel has hit some lunchbox sellers. For Tseng A-fa, sales at his store in the northern beachside Fulong village have fallen since a tunnel opened in 2006 making car travel easier. ""Fewer trains now stop at Fulong,"" he said. But Tseng, 70, says he still manages to sell 1,000 lunchboxes each day and will continue with his business - which has loyal customers. He has barely changed his recipe for 18 years, serving up rice piled with pork, tofu, egg and pickles. "	9/23/16	0	0	0.8012	1
"Taiwan should give up missile illusionnTaiwan should give up missile illusion An exclusive report in Taiwan's China Times revealed that Taiwan has decided to terminate efforts to develop a medium-range surface-to-surface guided missile capable of hitting Beijing and Shanghai. The report cited three reasons behind the decision of the administration of Tsai Ing-wen. One is the need to adjust its military strategy. Second, Taiwan is not developing nuclear weapons. Even if the missile can reach Shanghai and Beijing, it would not change the overall situation. Meanwhile, the Hsiungfeng 2E cruise missile can effectively cope with the mainland's coastal military targets. Citing Taiwan official sources, the report said the decision is a goodwill gesture toward the mainland. The Taiwan authorities have dismissed the report. It is unknown whether the report is based on hearsay or evidence. In the early years, Taiwan viewed the ability to ""counterattack the mainland"" as the core of its military strategy, which turned out to be an illusion. During the Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian era, Taiwan adopted the policy of ""effective deterrence"" toward the mainland and aimed at striking a military balance with the mainland. Later on, with the mainland swiftly developing its military strength, Taiwan's building of its ""national"" defense lost its meaning. The decision of Tsai and her administration to abandon the missile project can be seen as their recognition of the relative strengths of the mainland and Taiwan. However, showing goodwill to the mainland is far from the basic policy of the Tsai administration. The primary reason behind this decision probably lies in a lack of finance. The annual defense budget of Taiwan is only about $10 billion, and it would be unrealistic to count on it to develop a deterrence against the mainland. No matter the report is true or not, it makes more people realize that the mainland has seized the dominance of cross-Straits ties and is capable of safeguarding national unity by force when necessary. The Democratic Progressive Party highly expects the US to provide shelter for Taiwan. But with China's military capability effectively covering the offshore areas, how could Washington take the risk of putting ""Taiwan independence"" under its wing which it has publicly opposed? Over the past few years, the mainland has shown true strategic goodwill and patience. It did not put its ultimate goal of ""peaceful reunification"" on the tip of tongue. Rather, it has been trying to improve cross-Straits ties by adopting a series of policies favorable to Taiwan. However, the ""Taiwan independence"" forces have posed a long-term threat to the stability of the Taiwan Straits. The Tsai administration refuses to admit the 1992 Consensus, taking a big step backward in cross-Straits relations. If political tensions remain high across the Straits, even exchanges of fire by automatic rifles, not to mention missiles, can take the situation out of control. Now the ""Taiwan independence"" forces are making a fuss by trying to change the name of commonly used ""Chinese Taipei"" and join the United Nations. Both are political provocations. The security of Taiwan depends on the collective soberness within the island. It should keep up with the times. "	9/20/16	0	0	0.9819	1

"LegCo election shows a society increasingly polarizednIllustration: Liu Rui/GT The legislative council election was held at a key period after the Occupy Central movement, the rejection of a political reform package, and prior to the fifth chief executive election and the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China. The legislative council election is a political judgment on the government's past performances and will determine Hong Kong's future. The proportion of votes obtained respectively by the pro-establishment and pro-democracy camps remains four to six, but the former group has won more seats than the latter. The pro-democracy groups have retained their one-third veto bloc in the council and the veto power to block the government's attempts to enact controversial bills. Although this year's election was marked by a record turnout, more than 40 percent of the electorate decided not to use their right to vote as before. This election has brought about a number of changes as well. While the pro-establishment camp witnessed no major internal changes, the strategic space of small pro-democracy parties is being squeezed by emerging forces. ""Umbrella soldiers,"" renowned for their aspirations for revolution, have seen a sudden rise in the election. They appeal for the right of self-determination, but have not been integrated into an organization yet. A total of 26 members are newly elected, and this year's legislative council, with an average age of 47, is the youngest ever. Nathan Law Kwun-chung, 23, has broken the record to be the youngest councilor in Hong Kong's history. Voter mentality is the key to analyzing Hong Kong's politics. The electorate can be divided into five types. Some believe the mainland's support is indispensable to Hong Kong's development, and independence will lead Hong Kong nowhere. They think that the mainland, despite its challenges, has a bright future, and although the Hong Kong's government needs to enhance its services, it has already completed many projects that help the people and opposed filibustering. Some other voters are concerned about the mainland's intervention, and are dissatisfied with the Hong Kong's government. They want a balanced relationship, instead of confrontation, between Hong Kong and the mainland. There are also those who are radical in their aspirations for Hong Kong democracy. Some other voters hold a relatively neutral stance and cast their votes according to individual candidates' political views. The last type of voter cares little about politics. While the number of pro-establishment voters has seen a minor increase, radical voters have squeezed the space for other three types of voters to become the most rapidly rising group in the election. Voters are increasingly confrontational toward their opposition, and meanwhile fence-sitters dare not voice their opinions. Hong Kong is increasingly resembling Taiwan in recent years. The Sunflower Student Movement was launched on the island and its society is split into two camps, and meanwhile Hong Kong has seen the Umbrella movement and is divided into pro-establishment and pro-democracy camps. While Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party does not acknowledge the 1992 Consensus and calls for Taiwan independence, radical Hong Kong politicians call for self-determination. Although advocating confrontation may win candidates votes, it will do no good to the governing parties' ruling capability. Worse still, it will further split voters and intensify confrontation. Confrontation has already dragged Taiwan into a vicious circle. The situation in Hong Kong is worrying. But with the ""One Country, Two Systems"" policy, basic law, pro-establishment forces and mainstream conservative views, it is still better than Taiwan's. Hong Kong's ""Taiwanization"" is doomed to fail, but this is a reality that deserves attention. The author is a scholar on Hong Kong affairs. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn "	9/13/16	0	0	-0.4995	-1
"Mainland tourist decline sparks protestnNearly 20,000 people from tourism-related industries took to the streets in Taipei on Monday, calling on the Tsai Ing-wen administration to revive the tourism industry amid a sharp decline in tourist arrivals from the Chinese mainland. The drop in mainland tourists reflects strains in cross-Straits relations that emerged after pro-independence leader Tsai took office in May. Unlike her predecessor Ma Ying-jeou, Tsai has yet to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus, which emphasizes the one-China principle. Protesters from 11 tourism-related sectors, including hotels, travel agencies, bus companies and tour guides, chanted the slogan ""we want to live, to have jobs and to have enough to eat and wear"" during the protest on Monday in Taipei. They carried placards which read, ""Don't let tourism become a dead business,"" and ""People on both sides of the Taiwan Straits are of one family."" Lee Chi-yueh, spokesperson of the Tourism Industry Alliance, which organized the demonstration, was quoted by the Taiwan-based The China Post as saying that the purpose of the demonstration was to express ""in a rational manner"" the difficulties the tourism industry is experiencing under the current circumstances. Lee said that if the Taiwan administration does not take action to curtail the drop in tourist arrivals from the mainland since the Tsai administration took office, it will create additional problems for Taiwan' s society. Statistics from Taiwan's tourism bureau showed that around 300,000 mainland tourists visited Taiwan in July, down 15 percent from the same period last year. Mainland tourists make up 40 percent of the tourists visiting the island every year, the Straits Times reported. Zhang Hua, an assistant research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), told the Global Times that Taiwan's tourism is suffering from Tsai's political policies and the situation would not improve as long as Tsai refuses to recognize the 1992 Consensus. Unwelcoming attitude At least two Beijing-based travel agents confirmed with the Global Times that the number of tourists planning to go to Taiwan for the upcoming three-day-long Mid-Autumn Festival holiday and the weeklong National Day holiday has dropped markedly. They cited the less friendly environment as a reason. In June, a video clip went viral in the mainland in which a woman in Taiwan insulted a veteran by calling him ""a shameless China refugee"" and demanding that he ""scram back to the mainland."" Zhang said that Tsai's administration and her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have adopted a hostile attitude toward mainland tourists, which has led to instances of disrespectful behavior. Hu Benliang, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the CASS, told the Global Times that a string of incidents including the deadly tour bus crash in Taipei and some Taiwan media reports smearing the mainland also disappointed tourists. Twenty-three tourists and a tour guide from the Chinese mainland were killed in July when their bus crashed into a barrier on a highway and caught fire near Taiwan's Taoyuan Airport. Taiwan authorities released the findings of their investigation on Saturday, saying that the bus driver purposely crashed the vehicle after quarreling with his wife who had decided to return to the mainland. Pressured by the public, Tsai may adopt some measures, including subsidies and tax breaks, to pacify Taiwan's tourism industry, but it could not recover the economic loss, said Zhang. Tsai Chi-chang, vice president of Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, told Taiwan media on Thursday that mainland tourists have been used by mainland's united front department as a leverage and the administration should try to attract more tourists from Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia. However, both Hu and Zhang agreed that these measures would have limited effect on Taiwan's tourism since Chinese mainland tourists comprise the biggest part of the industry. Much of the tourism industry's income depends on tour groups from the mainland since they spend an average of 7.5 days on the island while tourists from other places spend an average of 3.5 days, The China Post reported, citing Lee.

"Obstacles continue to stall China-Vatican ties: expertsnObstacles remain in the way of diplomatic ties between China and the Vatican, experts said, as the Vatican expressed its hope Saturday of establishing formal relations with China. ""There is much hope and expectation that there will be new developments and a new season in relations between the Holy See and China,"" Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin was quoted by Reuters as saying on Saturday. ""[This] will benefit not just Catholics in the land of Confucius, but the whole country,"" Parolin said, adding that it also serves world peace. China, however, is not eager to establish formal ties with the Vatican, the only European country that has not established such relations with China, because it is not an urgent issue which will affect China's international status if it is not dealt with immediately, Yan Kejia, director of the Institute of Religious Studies at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday. Yan said formal Sino-Vatican ties could materialize if the Vatican cuts off official ties with Taiwan. ""The Vatican should stop its political relations with Taiwan and focus on religious matters with the island,"" Yan noted. Taiwan's deputy leader Chen Chien-jen will visit the Vatican next month for a ceremony declaring Mother Teresa a saint, Reuters reported. China has said countries should be prudent when dealing with Taiwan-related issues, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang told a daily briefing on Thursday and stressed the one-China principle when asked whether China had lodged a protest with the Vatican over the visit of Taiwan's deputy leader. Another major dispute between China and the Vatican involves the appointment of bishops, Hu Benliang, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday. The Vatican expressed its deep regret to China after the latter consecrated several bishops in 2010 without its approval, saying that it was a ""painful wound upon ecclesial communion and a grave violation of Catholic discipline."" The situation improved when Zhang Yinlin, a coadjutor bishop in the Anyang diocese in Central China's Henan Province, became the first bishop recognized by both Beijing and the Holy See in August 2015.
